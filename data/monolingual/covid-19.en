Past Coronaviruses
A coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat.
Most coronaviruses aren't dangerous.
In early 2020, after a December 2019 outbreak in China, the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus.
The outbreak quickly spread around the world.
COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection.
It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).
It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, mainly through person-to-person contact.
Infections range from mild to deadly.
SARS-CoV-2 is one of seven types of coronavirus, including the ones that cause severe diseases like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
The other coronaviruses cause most of the colds that affect us during the year but aren’t a serious threat for otherwise healthy people.
Is there more than one strain of SARS-CoV-2?
An early Chinese study of 103 COVID-19 cases found two strains, which they named L and S.
The S type is older, but the L type was more common in early stages of the outbreak.
They think one may cause more cases of the disease than the other, but they’re still working on what it all means.
It is also normal for a virus to change, or mutate, as it infects people and this virus has done so.
There are several variants which have been named for the regions they were first discovered but they have now spread to other areas and countries, some proving to be more contageous as well as more deadly.
How long will the coronavirus last?
There's no way to tell how long the pandemic will continue.
There are many factors, including the public’s efforts to slow the spread, researchers’ work to learn more about the virus, their search for a treatment, and the success of the vaccines.
The main symptoms include:
Fever
Coughing
Shortness of breath
Trouble breathing
Fatigue
Chills, sometimes with shaking
Body aches
Headache
Sore throat
Congestion/runny nose
Loss of smell or taste
Nausea
Diarrhea
The virus can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, heart problems, liver problems, septic shock, and death.
Many COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm.
This is when an infection triggers your immune system to flood your bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called cytokines.
They can kill tissue and damage your organs.
If you notice the following severe symptoms in yourself or a loved one, get medical help right away:
Trouble breathing or shortness of breath
Ongoing chest pain or pressure
New confusion
Can’t wake up fully
Bluish lips or face
Strokes have also been reported in some people who have COVID-19.
Remember FAST:
Face.
Is one side of the person’s face numb or drooping?
Is their smile lopsided?
Arms.
Is one arm weak or numb?
If they try to raise both arms, does one arm sag?
Can they speak clearly?
Ask them to repeat a sentence.
Every minute counts when someone shows signs of a stroke.
Call 911 right away.
If you’re infected, symptoms can show up in as few as 2 days or as many as 14.
It varies from person to person.
According to researchers in China, these were the most common symptoms among people who had COVID-19:
Fever 99%
Fatigue 70%
Cough 59%
Lack of appetite 40%
Body aches 35%
Shortness of breath 31%
Mucus/phlegm 27%
Some people who are hospitalized for COVID-19 have also have dangerous blood clots, including in their legs, lungs, and arteries.
What to do if you think you have it
If you live in or have traveled to an area where COVID-19 is spreading:
If you don’t feel well, stay home.
Even if you have mild symptoms like a headache and runny nose, stay in until you’re better.
This lets doctors focus on people who are more seriously ill and protects health care workers and people you might meet along the way.
You might hear this called self-quarantine.
Try to stay in a separate room away from other people in your home.
Use a separate bathroom if you can.
Call the doctor if you have trouble breathing.
You need to get medical help as soon as possible.
Calling ahead (rather than showing up) will let the doctor direct you to the proper place, which may not be your doctor’s office.
If you don’t have a regular doctor, call your local board of health.
They can tell you where to go for testing and treatment.
Follow your doctor’s advice and keep up with the news on COVID-19.
Between your doctor and health care authorities, you’ll get the care you need and information on how to prevent the virus from spreading.
For more information about COVID-19, see our FAQ.
How do I know if it’s COVID-19, a cold, or the flu?
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be similar to a bad cold or the flu.
Your doctor will suspect COVID-19 if:
You have a fever and a cough.
You have been exposed to people who have it within the last 14 days.
Is COVID-19 worse than the flu?
Unlike the flu, a lot of people aren’t immune to the coronavirus because it’s so new.
If you do catch it, the virus triggers your body to make things called antibodies.
Researchers are looking at whether the antibodies give you protection against catching it again.
The coronavirus also appears to cause higher rates of severe illness and death than the flu.
But the symptoms themselves can vary widely from person to person.
Is COVID-19 seasonal like the flu?
While it had been helped in the first year that higher temperatures and humidity levels might help slow the spread of the coronavirus, that was not the case.
Experts advise caution and say weather changes won’t matter without thorough public health efforts.
Also, past flu pandemics have happened year-round.
Researchers aren’t sure what caused it.
There’s more than one type of coronavirus.
They’re common in people and in animals including bats, camels, cats, and cattle.
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is similar to MERS and SARS.
They all came from bats.
Anyone can get COVID-19, and most infections are mild.
The older you are, the higher your risk of severe illness.
You also a have higher chance of serious illness if you have one of these health conditions:
Chronic kidney disease
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
A weakened immune system because of an organ transplant
Obesity
Serious heart conditions such as heart failure or coronary artery disease
Sickle cell disease
Type 2 diabetes
Conditions that could lead to severe COVID-19 illness include:
Moderate to severe asthma
Diseases that affect your blood vessels and blood flow to your brain
Cystic fibrosis
High blood pressure
A weakened immune system because of a blood or bone marrow transplant, HIV, or medications like corticosteroids
Dementia
Liver disease
Pregnancy
Damaged or scarred lung tissue (pulmonary fibrosis)
Smoking
Thalassemia
Type 1 diabetes
Some children and teens who are in the hospital with COVID-19 have an inflammatory condition that doctors are calling multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.
Doctors think it may be linked to the virus.
It causes symptoms similar to those of toxic shock and of Kawasaki disease, a condition that causes inflammation in kids’ blood vessels.
How does the coronavirus spread?
SARS-CoV-2, the virus, mainly spreads from person to person.
Most of the time, it spreads when a sick person coughs or sneezes.
They can spray aerosole droplets 6 feet away or even further.
If you breathe them in or swallow them, the virus can get into your body.
Some people who have the virus don't have symptoms, but they can still spread the virus.
While less likely, you can also get the virus from touching a surface or object the virus is on, then touching your mouth, nose, or possibly your eyes.
Most viruses can live for several hours on a surface that they land on.
A study shows that SARS-CoV-2 can last for several hours on various types of surfaces:
Copper (pennies, teakettles, cookware): 4 hours
Cardboard (shipping boxes): up to 24 hours
Plastic (milk containers, detergent bottles, subway and bus seats, elevator buttons):2 to 3 days
Stainless steel (refrigerators, pots and pans, sinks, some water bottles): 2 to 3 days
That’s why it’s important to disinfect surfaces to get rid of the virus.
Some dogs and cats have tested positive for the virus.
A few have shown signs of illness.
There’s no evidence that humans can catch this coronavirus from an animal, but it appears it can be passed from humans to animals.
What is community spread?
Doctors and health officials use this term when they don’t know the source of the infection.
With COVID-19, it usually refers to someone who gets the virus even though they haven’t been out of the country or haven’t been exposed to someone who’s traveled abroad or who has COVID-19.
In February 2020, the CDC confirmed a COVID-19 infection in California in a person who had not traveled to an affected area or been exposed to someone with the disease.
This marked the first instance of community spread in the U. S.
It’s likely that person was exposed to someone who was infected but didn’t know it.
This type of occurrence has been happening with the variants as well.
How fast is it spreading?
The number of people infected by SARS-CoV-2 changes every day.
How contagious is the coronavirus?
The transmission rate is relatively high.
Early research has estimated that one person who has it can spread it to between 2 and 3.
5 others.
One study found that the rate was higher, with one case spreading to between 4.
7 and 6.
6 other people.
By comparison, one person who has the seasonal flu will pass it to between 1.
1 and 2.
3 others.
The CDC reports there is evidence it can be transmitted if you get within 6 feet of someone who is infectious for a total of 15 minutes throughout a day.
It had previously been believed the exposure had to be 15 minutes at a time.
We can work to lower the transmission rate by wearing cloth face masks when we can’t stay 6 feet away from others, washing hands often, and keeping common surfaces clean, limiting contact with other people.
Can coronavirus be transmitted through groceries, packages, or food?
You’re much more likely to get COVID-19 from another person than from packages, groceries, or food.
If you’re in a high-risk group, stay home and use a delivery service or have a friend shop for you.
Have them leave the items outside your front door, if you can.
If you do your own shopping, wear and cloth face mask and try to stay at least 6 feet away from other shoppers.
Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds before and after bringing things into your home.
The coronavirus can linger on hard surfaces, so clean and disinfect countertops and anything else your bags have touched.
You can wipe down plastic, metal, or glass packaging with soap and water if you want.
There’s no evidence that anyone has gotten COVID-19 from food or food containers.
Call your doctor or local health department if you think you’ve been exposed and have symptoms like:
Fever of 100 F or higher
Cough
In most states, testing facilities have become more readily available.
While some require an appointment, others are simply drive-up.
There are also some home testing kits now available.
A swab test is the most common method.
It looks for signs of the virus in your upper respiratory tract.
The person giving the test puts a swab up your nose to get a sample from the back of your nose and throat.
That sample usually goes to a lab that looks for viral material, but some areas may have rapid tests that give results in as little as 15 minutes.
If there are signs of the virus, the test is positive.
A negative test could mean there is no virus or there wasn’t enough to measure.
That can happen early in an infection.
It usually takes 24 hours to get results, but the tests must be collected, stored, shipped to a lab, and processed.
The FDA is granting emergency use authorizations for tests that include home nasal swab tests which you collect yourself and express ship back to the lab for analysis.
The agency has also approved several at-home rapid tests.
you have to get these through a prescription so the results will be registered.
You can receive those results within a few minutes.
A swab test can only tell whether you have the virus in your body at that moment.
But you may also consider taking an antibody test which can show whether you’ve ever been exposed to the virus, even if you didn’t have symptoms.
This is important in officials’ efforts to learn how widespread COVID-19 is.
In time, it might also help them figure out who’s immune to the virus.
The FDA is working with laboratories across the country to develop more tests.
Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 is a key part of prevention.
But you should also take these steps:
Cover your nose and mouth in public.
If you have COVID-19, you can spread it even if you don’t feel sick.
Wear a cloth face covering to protect others.
This isn’t a replacement for social distancing.
You still need to keep a 6-foot distance between yourself and those around you.
Don’t use a face mask meant for health care workers.
And don’t put a face covering on anyone who is:
Under 2 years old
Having trouble breathing
Unconscious or can’t remove the mask on their own for other reasons
Wash your hands often with soap and water or clean them with an alcohol-based sanitizer.
This kills viruses on your hands.
Don’t touch your face.
Coronaviruses can live on surfaces you touch for several hours.
If they get on your hands and you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, they can get into your body.
Practice social distancing.
Because you can have and spread the virus without knowing it, you should stay home as much as possible.
If you do have to go out, stay at least 6 feet away from others.
Clean and disinfect.
You can clean first with soap and water, but disinfect surfaces you touch often, like tables, doorknobs, light switches, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
Use a mix of household bleach and water (1/3 cup bleach per gallon of water, or 4 teaspoons bleach per quart of water) or a household cleaner that’s approved to treat SARS-CoV-2.
You can check the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) website to see if yours made the list.
Wear gloves when you clean and throw them away when you’re done.
There’s no proof that herbal therapies and teas can prevent infection.
COVID-19 preparation tips
In addition to practicing the prevention tips listed above, you can:
Meet as a household or larger family to talk about who needs what.
If you have people at a higher risk, ask their doctor what to do.
Talk to your neighbors about emergency planning.
Join your neighborhood chat group or website to stay in touch.
Find community aid organizations that can help with health care, food delivery, and other supplies.
Make an emergency contact list.
Include family, friends, neighbors, carpool drivers, doctors, teachers, employers, and the local health department.
Choose a room (or rooms) where you can keep someone who’s sick or who’s been exposed separate from the rest of you.
Talk to your child’s school about keeping up with assignments.
Set yourself up to work from home if your office is closed.
Reach out to friends or family if you live alone.
Make plans for them to check on you by phone, email, or video chat.
Can a face mask protect you from infection?
The CDC recommends that if you are not vaccinated, you should wear a cloth face mask if you go out in public.
If you are at home with someone who has been infected or exposed, you should wear it as well.
A mask is an added layer of protection for everyone, on top of social distancing efforts.
You can spread the virus when you talk or cough, even if you don’t know that you have it or if you aren’t showing signs of infection.
The CDC advises that surgical masks and N95 masks should be reserved for health care workers and first responders.
Is it safe to travel during a pandemic?
Crowded places can raise your chances of getting COVID-19.
The CDC recommends against international or cruise ship travel during the pandemic.
Restrictions are being eased for those who are vaccinated, and some areas are using “vaccine passports” as a way to open up to vaccinated travelers.
A few questions may help you decide whether it’s safe to travel:
Is the coronavirus spreading where you’re going?
Will you have close contact with other people during the trip?
Are you at higher risk of severe illness if you catch the virus?
Do you live with someone who has a serious medical condition?
Will the place where you’ll be staying be cleaned?
Will you have access to food and other necessities?
If you choose to travel, stay away from sick people.
Wash your hands often, and try not to touch your face.
Wear a cloth face mask when you’ll be around other people.
All airlines require all customers to use them.
They are also required on other forms of public transportation ushc as trains and buses.
How can you help stop the spread of the coronavirus?
Because the virus spreads from person to person, it’s important to limit your contact with other people as much as possible.
and avoid large gatherings.
Many states and cities have eased restrictions but this doesn’t mean the virus is gone.
Continue to follow safety practices such as wearing a cloth face mask in public places and washing your hands.
While many companies continue to use work-from-home practices, that is not possible for a lot of workers.
Some people work in “essential businesses” that are vital to daily life, such as health care, law enforcement, and public utilities.
Everyone else should countinue to limit your time in public as much as you can and wear a cloth face mask when you can’t.
The following terms have now become commonplace:
Social distancing or physical distancing, keeping space between yourself and other people when you have to go out
Quarantine, keeping someone home and separated from other people if they might have been exposed to the virus
Isolation, keeping sick people away from healthy people, including using a separate “sick” bedroom and bathroom when possible
Precautions should still be followed even if you are vaccinated.
On Dec.
11, 2020, the FDA granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) in the U. S.
for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.
Within a week, that agency also granted an EUA to a vaccine developed by Moderna.
Johnson & Johnson's single shot vaccine was granted EUA in February, 2021.
The British government approved and began to give the Pfizer vaccine on Dec.
8, 2020.
Vaccines developed in China and Russia are now also being given in several other countries.
Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses, taken a few weeks apart while J & J is just one shot.
Health care workers and the elderly were originally given priority in receiving the vaccines but by May, the vaccines were made available to anyone over the age of 12 years-old.
These vaccines were developed at an unprecedented speed, with testing in humans starting in March 2020.
The FDA says that no corners were cut to allow for approval and that the innoculations are safe.
The CDC has said it is safe for pregnant women and there's no evidence that antibodies formed from COVID-19 vaccination cause any problem with pregnancy,.
Clinical trials for other vaccines are still underway.
If you're interested in volunteering for a COVID-19 vaccine trial, here are some sources of more information:
Government-sponsored sites:
COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN).
This is funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and coordinated by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.
Its goal is to enroll thousands of volunteers into COVID vaccine trials nationwide.
Many research centers are using this site to find volunteers.
Clinicaltrials.
gov.
This is a government database of public and private clinical studies done worldwide.
The site also offers considerations for joining a clinical trial.
Sites that link volunteers with trials nationwide include:
CenterWatch
COVID Dash
World Without COVID
Individual hospitals, universities, research centers, and others may also provide opportunities to enroll in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial.
Some include:
Kaiser Permanente
Medical University of South Carolina
Meridian Clinical Research
Penn Medicine
Saint Louis University
SAResearch (Clinical Trials of Texas)
University of California, Davis
University of California, San Diego
University of Maryland
University of Rochester Medical Center
Vanderbilt University
Wake Research
You can also call or visit the website of your local hospital or research institution to find out if they are taking part in any trials.
There’s no specific treatment for COVID-19.
People who get a mild case need care to ease their symptoms, like rest, fluids, and fever control.
Take over-the-counter medicine for a sore throat, body aches, and fever.
But don't give aspirin to children or teens younger than 19.
You might have heard that you shouldn't take ibuprofen to treat COVID-19 symptoms.
But the National Institutes of Health says people who have the virus can use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen as usual.
Antibiotics won’t help because they treat bacteria, not viruses.
If you hear about people with COVID-19 getting antibiotics, it’s for an infection that came along with the disease.
People with severe symptoms need to be cared for in the hospital.
The antiviral medication called remdesivir (Veklury) is the first medication to get FDA approval for treatment of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
Originally developed to treat Ebola, evidence shows that those treated with remdesivir recovered in about 11 days compared to 15 days for those treated with a placebo.
Many clinical trials are under way to explore treatments used for other conditions that could fight COVID-19 and to develop new ones.
For instance, trials are under way for tocilizumab, another medication used to treat autoimmune conditions.
And the FDA is also allowing clinical trials and hospital use of blood plasma from people who’ve had COVID-19 and recovered to help others build immunity.
You’ll hear this called convalescent plasma.
Currently, evidence of its effectiveness is limited.
Early in the pandemic, the anti-malarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were considered as possible treatments.
The FDA later rescinded an emergency use order because studies found that the drugs were ineffetive and the risks outweighed the benefits.
A variety of steroid medications are being used including dexamethasone which is used to treat conditions such as arthritis, blood/hormone/immune system disorders, allergic reactions,.
More studies on effectiveness are still being conducted.
Is there a cure for the new coronavirus?
There’s no cure yet, but researchers are working hard to find one.
Every case is different.
You may have mild flu-like symptoms for a few days after exposure, then get better.
But some cases can be severe or fatal.
Symptoms can also linger for weeks, even if they’re mild.
More than a third of people older than 18 who have signs of the virus aren’t totally recovered 2 or 3 weeks later, according to a CDC survey.
Fatigue and cough were the symptoms that were most likely to linger.
Some other people who’ve had COVID-19 develop a condition similar to myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome.
They may have a brain fog, severe fatigue, pain, trouble thinking, or dizziness.
What is the recovery rate for coronavirus?
Scientists and researchers are constantly tracking COVID-19 infections and recoveries.
But they don’t have information about the outcome of every infection.
Early estimates predict that the overall COVID-19 recovery rate will be between 97% and 99.
75%.
Can you get the coronavirus twice?
There have been a few cases of reinfection reported and presently, it is considered a rare occurrence.
With other coronaviruses that only cause colds, you have a period that you’re immune, but that goes away over time.
That also appears to be the case with this coronavirus.
Immunity is estimated to last at least three to four months.
Are coronaviruses new?
Coronaviruses were first identified in the 1960s.
Almost everyone gets a coronavirus infection at least once in their life, most likely as a young child.
In the United States, regular coronaviruses are more common in the fall and winter, but anyone can come down with a coronavirus infection at any time.
The symptoms of most coronaviruses are similar to any other upper respiratory infection, including a runny nose, coughing, sore throat, and sometimes a fever.
In most cases, you won't know whether you have a coronavirus or a different cold-causing virus, such as a rhinovirus.
You treat this kind of coronavirus infection the same way you treat a cold.
Have there been other serious coronavirus outbreaks?
Coronaviruses have led to two serious outbreaks:
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
About 858 people have died from MERS, which first appeared in Saudi Arabia and then in other countries in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Europe.
In April 2014, the first American was hospitalized for MERS in Indiana, and another case was reported in Florida.
Both had just returned from Saudi Arabia.
In May 2015, there was an outbreak of MERS in South Korea, which was the largest outbreak outside of the Arabian Peninsula.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
In 2003, 774 people died from an outbreak.
As of 2015, there were no further reports of cases of SARS.
Coronavirus and RSV
Coronavirus vs.
RSV
Comparing Symptoms
Is Your Child at Risk for COVID-19?
How to Stay Healthy
When to Get Medical Care
Coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are two kinds of respiratory illnesses that have some similar symptoms.
So far, the new coronavirus appears to be more dangerous for adults, especially older ones.
RSV is riskier for young children, but it can also be serious for older people and those who have other health problems.
Coronaviruses are a group of common viruses that infect the respiratory tract.
The newest one is the virus that causes COVID-19.
Though COVID-19 can affect children, adults make up most of the cases diagnosed so far.
Adults are also more likely to have serious symptoms from the coronavirus, especially if they're over 65 or have a condition like diabetes, lung disease, or heart disease.
RSV can also affect people of ages, but it's especially common in infants and young children.
By age 2, nearly every child will have been infected.
Most cases are mild.
But some children are more likely to get seriously ill, including:
Infants 6 months or younger
Babies who were born early
Children under 2 with chronic lung or heart disease
Children with a weak immune system
Children who have trouble swallowing
Each year, RSV sends more than 57,000 children to the hospital.
When adults and older children catch RSV, they usually have only minor symptoms that are similar to a cold.
RSV can also be serious for some, though, including:
People over 65
Those with a weakened immune system
Those with heart or lung diseases
Some 177,000 older adults are hospitalized for RSV each year in the United States, and 14,000 of them die.
Both illnesses spread the same way: Someone who is infected coughs or sneezes, sending droplets containing the virus into the air.
You can get sick if the droplets land on you, or if you touch a surface that has the virus on it and then put your fingers in your nose, mouth, or eyes.
Both COVID-19 and RSV can cause these symptoms:
Runny nose
Children with coronavirus often have mild symptoms.
Some have no symptoms at all.
Adults with COVID-19 often also notice shortness of breath.
Their symptoms can range from mild to life-threatening.
Along with cold-like symptoms, RSV causes:
Appetite loss
Sneezing
Trouble breathing (shortness of breath or wheezing) in kids and adults
Crankiness (in young children)
RSV can also lead to more serious problems like:
Bronchiolitis, which causes swelling in the small air sacs in the lungs
Pneumonia, a lung infection
The new coronavirus is very contagious.
Kids face the same risk of catching it as adults, although the disease is usually milder in children.
They can also spread it to others.
We don't know yet whether some children are more likely to have a serious illness from this coronavirus.
We do know that adults are more likely to get seriously sick from COVID-19 if they're over 65 or have:
Heart disease
Lung disease
Diabetes
A weak immune system
But even young adults are at risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19.
One study found that one-fifth of those ages 25-40 were sick enough to go to a hospital.
The best way to prevent yourself and your children from catching coronavirus or RSV is to stay away from anyone who might be sick.
Here are a few other prevention tips that work well for both illnesses:
Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds at a time, especially after you use the bathroom and before you eat.
Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water aren't available.
Keep your hands away from your mouth, nose, and eyes.
For kids, that means no thumb-sucking or nose-picking.
Ask everyone in the house to cough and sneeze into their elbow or a tissue, not their hand.
Clean and disinfect things that are often touched, like doorknobs, countertops, and toys.
Don't let kids share personal items like utensils or cups with anyone.
Most kids with coronavirus have a mild case and get better on their own.
While they're sick, keep them at home and away from everyone else in the house who's healthy.
Do the same for yourself if you have symptoms of COVID-19.
Call your doctor's office or local health department for advice if RSV or COVID-19 symptoms get worse for you or your child.
Get medical help right away if you notice:
Trouble breathing (In babies, the signs include flaring nostrils or the belly sucking in.
Pain or pressure in the chest
Confusion
Trouble waking up
Blue lips or face
Not eating or drinking well
A hard time talking or saying sentences
Because RSV can turn serious quickly, call your doctor if your child:
Has symptoms like a runny nose, fever, and cough and is less than 6 months old
Runs a fever of 100.
4 F and is under 6 months old, or has a fever over 104 F at any age
Is wheezing or breathing quickly
Doesn't eat or drink much
Isn't as alert or active as usual
Wets fewer than 1 diaper every 8 hours, which could be a sign of dehydration

Caring for Someone Who Has COVID-19 Symptoms
COVID-19 is a respiratory condition caused by a coronavirus.
Some people are infected but don’t notice any symptoms.
Most people will have mild symptoms and get better on their own.
But about 1 in 6 will have severe problems, such as trouble breathing.
The odds of more serious symptoms are higher if you’re older or have another health condition like diabetes or heart disease.
Here’s what to look for if you think you might have COVID-19.
Many drugs have been considered for treatment of COVID-19: some are monoclonal antibodies that have been granted emergency use authorizations .
Only remdesivir (Veklury), an IV antiviral drug has been approved by the FDA, and it is only approved for use in hospitalized patients.

COVID-19 can also cause problems including:
Pinkeye
Swollen eyes
Fainting
Guillain-Barre syndrome
Coughing up blood
Blood clots
Seizures
Heart problems
Kidney damage
Liver problems or damage
Some doctors have reported rashes tied to COVID-19, including purple or blue lesions on children’s toes and feet.
Researchers are looking into these reports so they can understand the effect on people who have COVID-19.
Researchers say kids have many of the same COVID-19 symptoms as adults, but they tend to be milder.
Common symptoms in children include:
Fever: 56%
Cough: 54%
Shortness of breath: 13%
Some children and teens who are in the hospital with the disease have an inflammatory syndrome that may be linked to the new coronavirus.
Doctors call it pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (PMIS).
Symptoms include a fever, a rash, belly pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and heart problems.
It’s similar to toxic shock or to Kawasaki disease, a condition in children that causes inflammation in blood vessels.
Your regular body temperature may be higher or lower than someone else’s.
It also changes throughout the day.
Doctors generally consider a fever in an adult to be anything over 100.
4 F on an oral thermometer and over 100.
8 F on a rectal thermometer.
If you think you’ve come into contact with the virus, or if you have symptoms, isolate yourself and check your temperature every morning and evening for at least 14 days.
Keep track of the readings.
A fever is the most common symptom of COVID-19, but it’s sometimes below 100 F.
In a child, a fever is a temperature above 100 F on an oral thermometer or 100.
4 F on a rectal one.
Early studies have found that at least 60% of people with COVID-19 have a dry cough.
About a third have a cough with mucus, called a “wet” or “productive” cough.
If you have milder symptoms like a fever, shortness of breath, or coughing:
Stay home unless you need medical care.
If you do need to go in, call your doctor or hospital first for guidance.
Tell your doctor about your illness.
If you’re at high risk of complications because of your age or other health conditions, they might have more instructions.
Isolate yourself.
This means staying away from other people as much as possible, even members of your family.
Stay in a specific “sick room,” and use a separate bathroom if you can.
Wear a cloth face covering if you have to be around anyone else.
This includes people you live with.
Rest up, and drink plenty of fluids.
Over-the-counter medicines might help you feel better.
Keep track of your symptoms.
If they get worse, get medical help right away.
Dyspnea is the word doctors use for shortness of breath.
It can feel like you:
Have tightness in your chest
Can’t catch your breath
Can’t get enough air into your lungs
Can’t breathe deeply
Are smothering, drowning, or suffocating
Have to work harder than usual to breathe in or out
Need to breathe in before you’re done breathing out
You should monitor your oxygen levels and if they dip into the 80s, contact your doctor.
If your face and/or lips get a bluish tint, call 911 immediately.
Since they share so many symptoms, it can be hard to know which condition you have.
But there are a few guidelines that can help.
You may have COVID-19 if you have a fever and trouble breathing, along with the symptoms listed above.
If you don’t have problems breathing, it might be the flu.
You should still isolate yourself just in case.
It’s probably allergies if you don’t have a fever but your eyes are itchy, you’re sneezing, and you have a runny nose.
If you don’t have a fever and your eyes aren’t itchy, it’s probably a cold.
Call your doctor if you’re concerned about any symptoms.
COVID-19 can range from mild to severe, so it may be hard to diagnose.
Testing could be available in your area.
In more serious infections
There are COVID-19 vaccines available and you should get one, if possible.
Otherwise, take these steps to prevent COVID-19:
Wash your hands often, for at least 20 seconds each time, with soap and water.
Use an alcohol-based sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if you don't have soap and water handy.
Limit your contact with other people.
Stay at least 6 feet away from others if you have to go out.
Wear a cloth face mask in public places.
Avoid people who are sick.
Don’t touch your eyes, nose, or mouth unless you’ve just washed your hands.
Regularly clean and disinfect surfaces that you touch a lot.
What Does COVID-19 Do to Your Lungs?
Coronavirus and Your Lungs
Mild and Moderate Cases
Severe Cases
Critical Cases
COVID-19 Complications
COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, one that especially reaches into your respiratory tract, which includes your lungs.
COVID-19 can cause a range of breathing problems, from mild to critical.
Older adults and people who have other health conditions like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes may have more serious symptoms.
Here’s what the new coronavirus does to your lungs.
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is part of the coronavirus family.
When the virus gets in your body, it comes into contact with the mucous membranes that line your nose, mouth, and eyes.
The virus enters a healthy cell and uses the cell to make new virus parts.
It multiplies, and the new viruses infect nearby cells.
Think of your respiratory tract as an upside-down tree.
The trunk is your trachea, or windpipe.
It splits into smaller and smaller branches in your lungs.
At the end of each branch are tiny air sacs called alveoli.
This is where oxygen goes into your blood and carbon dioxide comes out.
The new coronavirus can infect the upper or lower part of your respiratory tract.
It travels down your airways.
The lining can become irritated and inflamed.
In some cases, the infection can reach all the way down into your alveoli.
COVID-19 is a new condition, and scientists are learning more every day about what it can do to your lungs.
They believe that the effects on your body are similar to those of two other coronavirus diseases, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
As the infection travels your respiratory tract, your immune system fights back.
Your lungs and airways swell and become inflamed.
This can start in one part of your lung and spread.
About 80% of people who have COVID-19 get mild to moderate symptoms.
You may have a dry cough or a sore throat.
Some people have pneumonia, a lung infection in which the alveoli are inflamed.
Doctors can see signs of respiratory inflammation on a chest X-ray or CT scan.
On a chest CT, they may see something they call “ground-glass opacity” because it looks like the frosted glass on a shower door.
About 14% of COVID-19 cases are severe, with an infection that affects both lungs.
As the swelling gets worse, your lungs fill with fluid and debris.
You might also have more serious pneumonia.
The air sacs fill with mucus, fluid, and other cells that are trying to fight the infection.
This can make it harder for your body to take in oxygen.
You may have trouble breathing or feel short of breath.
You may also breathe faster.
If your doctor takes a CT scan of your chest, the opaque spots in your lungs look like they start to connect to each other.
In critical COVID-19 -- about 5% of total cases -- the infection can damage the walls and linings of the air sacs in your lungs.
As your body tries to fight it, your lungs become more inflamed and fill with fluid.
This can make it harder for them to swap oxygen and carbon dioxide.
You might have severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In the most critical cases, your lungs need help from a machine called a ventilator to do their job.
There’s evidence that 20-30% of the critically ill patients can develop clots in the lungs, heart, brain and legs, some of which are life threatening.
A few people have needed lung transplants because of severe tissue damage from COVID-19.
It can take time to feel better after you have pneumonia.
You may feel more tired than usual for a while.
You might also find that you can’t exercise like you used to.
Some people had a cough even after they recovered from COVID-19.
Others had scarring in their lungs.
Doctors are still studying whether these effects are permanent or might heal over time.
How to Help Isolated Older People During a Coronavirus Outbreak
Send Them a Care Package
Schedule a Weekly Video Call
Help Them Get Organized
Watch a Movie Together
Host a Book Club
Check in With Their Facility
Write Letters
COVID-19 has changed the way we interact with our families.
With older adults urged to stay away from other people as much as possible, popping in to see mom and dad is not an option.
It can be hard to keep away from your elder loved ones while the coronavirus is a threat, but it's important.
As people age, their immune systems weaken and they're not as able to fight off the virus.
People 60 and older, especially those with conditions like heart and lung disease, are more in danger of serious illness due to COVID-19.
They're more likely to be admitted to the hospital and to die from the disease.
People who are infected with the virus don't always show symptoms.
Even if you and your kids feel fine, you could unknowingly bring it into your parents' home.
But staying away can cause problems, too.
People who are isolated are at greater risk for depression, anxiety, heart disease, and mental decline.
So it's time to get creative.
There are things you can do to keep elderly loved ones from feeling lonely but still keep them safe.
The CDC recommends that everyone stock up on enough food and other supplies to stay home for a few weeks.
Because it might be hard for older people to get to the store, put together a care package of things you know they'll need, such as:
Foods that will last for several weeks, like canned fruits and vegetables, cereal, and soup
Over-the-counter medicines to treat a fever, cough, and other symptoms
Health and medical supplies such as tissues, toilet paper, bandages, and oxygen if needed
Disinfecting cleaning sprays and wipes
Drop off these items at your loved ones' front door, or order them from an online store that ships.
Also make sure older people have at least a 30-day supply of their prescription drugs on hand.
Offer to reorder from the drugstore when they run low, and pick up the medicine for them if you live close enough.
When you can't be there in person, a video call is the next best thing.
Communication tools like Skype and free apps like Zoom, WhatsApp, and FaceTime can make you feel like you're together even when you're thousands of miles away.
Research finds that interacting through technology improves symptoms of isolation and depression in older adults.
Schedule a time each week for a video call to check in with each other.
Ask your kids to sing a song or tell a story.
Or play a board game together virtually to keep the family connection alive.
The CDC recommends that everyone have a plan in place to protect themselves and their family during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Offer to help your loved ones write up their plan.
Put together a list of contact information for them that includes:
Local organizations such as their public health department
Who to call if they have symptoms
Emergency contacts such as family, friends, and neighbors
Nearby meal and grocery delivery services
Their doctor and health insurance company
You might not be able to sit side-by-side on the couch right now, but you can still take in a movie with your loved ones.
Streaming services like Netflix Party and Metastream will let you chat with each other while you watch your favorite flicks.
Use your extra time to catch up on all the books you and your parents have had on your read-next list.
Each week, have one person choose a book for everyone in the family to read.
At the end of the week, schedule a video chat session to discuss the story.
Be especially vigilant if your loved ones live in an assisted living or nursing home.
There have been several COVID-19 outbreaks at these places.
Call the home and find out what they're doing to protect their residents.
Ask questions like:
What procedures will you follow if there is an outbreak?
Have any of the residents been sick?
How do you identify people who are sick?
What is your policy on visitors?
What medical supplies do you have on hand in case of an outbreak?
What is your sick leave policy?
Do you have a plan in place for when staff are sick?
Letter writing may be a neglected art these days, but it's one of the most heartfelt ways to stay connected.
Sometimes it's easier to express yourself and tell your loved ones what they mean to you on paper than over the phone or in person.
Coronavirus History
Where Did the Coronavirus Come From?
Coronavirus Evolution
Coronaviruses are a big family of different viruses.
Some of them cause the common cold in people.
Others infect animals, including bats, camels, and cattle.
But how did SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19, come into being?
Here’s what we know about the virus that was first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and has set off a global pandemic.
Experts say SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
That’s also how the coronaviruses behind Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) got started.
SARS-CoV-2 made the jump to humans at one of Wuhan’s open-air “wet markets.
They’re where customers buy fresh meat and fish, including animals that are killed on the spot.
Some wet markets sell wild or banned species like cobras, wild boars, and raccoon dogs.
Crowded conditions can let viruses from different animals swap genes.
Sometimes the virus changes so much it can start to infect and spread among people.
Still, the Wuhan market didn’t sell bats at the time of the outbreak.
That’s why early suspicion also fell on pangolins, also called scaly anteaters, which are sold illegally in some markets in China.
Some coronaviruses that infect pangolins are similar to SARS-CoV-2.
As SARS-CoV-2 spread both inside and outside China, it infected people who have had no direct contact with animals.
That meant the virus is transmitted from one human to another.
It’s now spreading in the U. S.
and around the globe, meaning that people are unwittingly catching and passing on the coronavirus.
This growing worldwide transmission is what is now a pandemic.
Scientists first identified a human coronavirus in 1965.
It caused a common cold.
Later that decade, researchers found a group of similar human and animal viruses and named them after their crown-like appearance.
Seven coronaviruses can infect humans.
The one that causes SARS emerged in southern China in 2002 and quickly spread to 28 other countries.
More than 8,000 people were infected by July 2003, and 774 died.
A small outbreak in 2004 involved only four more cases.
This coronavirus causes fever, headache, and respiratory problems such as cough and shortness of breath.
MERS started in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
Almost all of the nearly 2,500 cases have been in people who live in or travel to the Middle East.
This coronavirus is less contagious than its SARS cousin but more deadly, killing 858 people.
It has the same respiratory symptoms but can also cause kidney failure.
Coronavirus and Dental Care
Is the Dentist’s Office Safe?
What to Think About Before Going to the Dentist
What Are Non-Urgent Treatments?
What Is an Emergency Treatment?
After asking dental offices to stop non-urgent visits and surgeries because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the American Dental Association (ADA) and the CDC now recommend that dental teams weigh the risk in their area with the need to provide care for patients.
Here’s what you should know about dental care as some cities and states reopen.
You come into contact with germs any time you leave your home.
But all health care workers should follow certain safety guidelines.
Your dentist and others working with them should wash their hands and sterilize tools.
Some gear and needles are never reused.
But your dentist’s office may do even more to prevent the spread of COVID-19, like:
Disinfect all surfaces and tools more often
Clean, replace, and cover tools between uses
Wear more protective gear than usual
Cover your mouth with a rubber dental dam
They may also:
Space out appointments
Call you before your appointment to ask about your health
Check your temperature and other symptoms
Require you to wear a face mask
Ask about your recent travel
Ask whether you’ve been around people who have COVID-19
Tell you not to arrive early
Ask you to limit the number of people you bring with you, such as children
Have you wait outside until they’re ready for you
Place waiting room chairs 6 feet apart for social distancing
Get rid of common things people touch in the waiting room, such as toys and magazines
The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 spreads through respiratory droplets.
That’s what flies through the air when someone coughs or sneezes.
If another person breathes this in, they can get sick.
It’s also in the mucus and saliva in your mouth and throat.
Those are fluids your dentist and their tools easily come in contact with.
Some dental devices can spray these droplets around.
Many dental offices aren’t designed for high levels of protection.
That’s because many don’t have:
Airborne infection isolation rooms
Rooms for one client
Any or enough N95 face masks
These are sometimes called elective procedures.
It’s dental work that doesn’t affect your health right now.
In other words, you can put it off until later if you’re worried about COVID-19.
Some examples include:
Teeth cleaning or exams
X-rays
Treatment for things that don’t hurt (cavities, tooth removal)
Teeth whitening
Fixing cosmetic problems
Checkup for braces
The ADA says something should be treated right away if it’s life-threatening or if it causes severe pain or a high risk of infection.
Generally, your dentist decides what’s urgent.
This may include:
Serious pain
Bleeding that won’t stop
Tissue that needs a biopsy
Swollen areas in or around your mouth (gums, face, or neck)
Broken teeth, especially if they cause pain or tissue damage
Signs of infection (pain and swelling)
Post-surgery care you can’t do yourself
A temporary crown that’s lost or broken
Dental work related to cancer treatment
Dentures that don’t work the right way
Wires in your braces that hurt
Trauma that may affect your ability to breathe
Call your dentist if you have questions about your dental care and whether you should come in for an appointment or wait until later.
If they can’t see you during an emergency, try an urgent care center.
Don’t go to the ER unless your dentist isn’t available.
Tell your dentist if you have COVID-19 or think you do.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
There are special steps they can take to lower the chances that the virus will spread.
They’ll work with you and your doctor to get you the right care.
Let your dental office know if you start feeling ill with COVID-19 symptoms within 14 days of your appointment.
You could have been carrying the virus at that time and possibly have spread it to other people.
Coronaviruses cause a range of illnesses, including COVID-19.
They typically affect the respiratory tract, but their effects can extend well beyond the respiratory system.
At the end of 2019, scientists identified a coronavirus outbreak in China.
Experts named the newly identified virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the illness that it causes coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
There are many types of coronavirus.
Some causeTrusted Source mild illnesses, such as the common cold.
Others can cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which can be life threatening.
Many coronaviruses are present in animals but do not affect humans.
Sometimes, however, a virus mutates in a way that allows it to infect humans.
Scientists call these human coronaviruses, or “HCoVs.
This article looks at a few coronaviruses that can infect humans, the illnesses they cause, and how they transmit.
Specifically, we focus on three dangerous diseases caused by coronaviruses: COVID-19, SARS, and MERS.
What is a coronavirus?
Researchers first identified a coronavirus in 1937.
They isolated one that was responsible for a type of bronchitis in birds and had the potential to devastate poultry stocks.
Scientists found evidence of human coronaviruses in the 1960sTrusted Source, in the noses of people with the common cold.
SeveralTrusted Source human coronaviruses cause mild illnesses, including colds.
The name “coronavirus” refers to the crown-like projections on the pathogen’s surface.
“Corona” in Latin means “halo” or “crown.
In humans, coronavirus infections most often occur in the winter and early spring, but they can happen at any time.
Learn more about how coronaviruses affect the body.
COVID-19
Late in 2019, scientists started monitoring the outbreak of a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19.
They first identified the virus in Wuhan, China.
The virus spread rapidly around the world, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic in March 2020Trusted Source.
The new coronavirus has been responsible for millions of infections globally, and it has caused more than 2 million deaths.
The mortality rate varies from country to country.
In the United States, it is around 1.
7%.
Many researchersTrusted Source believe SARS-CoV-2 first infected bats before spreading to other animals, including humans.
Some of the first people with COVID-19 had links to a live animal and seafood market.
Overall, however, there is little conclusive information about the origins of the virus.
Scientists are still investigating its source and initial pattern of spreading.
Many people with COVID-19 experience a relatively mild form of the disease that does not require specialist treatment.
Others develop severe breathing problems and need to spend time in the hospital.
In some cases, it is fatal.
Some people who do not have severe symptoms initially go on to develop health issues that continue for weeks or months, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source.
People with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms includeTrusted Source older adults and those with underlying medical conditions, including high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, and cancer.
According to the CDCTrusted Source, most children with COVID-19 have mild or no symptoms.
Fewer children have developed COVID-19 than adults.
That said, infants and children with certain medical conditions may have an increased risk of severe illness and death.
There may also be a higher risk of severe COVID-19 during pregnancy, as well as an increased risk of issues such as preterm birth.
However, the role of the virus in these circumstances remains unclear.
Which treatments can help with COVID-19?
People may start to experience COVID-19 symptoms 2–14 days after exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
Symptoms of COVID-19 include:
a fever
chills
a cough
shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
a sore throat
congestion or a runny nose
fatigue
a headache
muscle pain
a new loss of taste or smell
nausea, vomiting, or both
diarrhea
Tests can detect the infection, even if there are no symptoms.
As the virus progresses, severe complications can arise.
COVID-19 can affect a wide range of body systems and lead to multiple organ failure.
Systemic inequalities in healthcare have increased the risk of illness and death for people in marginalized racial and ethnic groups.
SARS
SARS is a disease caused by an infection with a different coronavirus — SARS-CoV.
It can lead to a life threatening form of pneumonia.
SARS first appeared in Asia in February 2003Trusted Source.
The virus then spread to more than two dozen countries, resulting in 8,098Trusted Source infections and 774 deaths.
The last reported cases in humans occurred in a laboratory-related outbreak in China in 2004.
Symptoms of SARS
Early symptoms are flu-like and includeTrusted Source:
a high fever
body aches
a feeling of discomfort
mild respiratory symptoms, in some cases
The infection affects both the upper and lower respiratory tracts.
After 7–10 days, the person may develop a dry cough.
Also, pneumonia, a severe lung infection, often develops.
As SARS progresses, it can lead to failure of the lungs, liver, or heart.
During the outbreak, complications were more common among older adults.
According to one source, more than half of those who died from the disease were over the age of 65.
MERS
MERS is a severe respiratory illness caused by the MERS-CoV coronavirus.
Scientists first recognized it in 2012 after reports in Saudi Arabia.
After that, it spread to other countries, including the U. S.
MERS has not become widespread in the same way as COVID-19.
According to reported figures, about 30–40% of people with MERS die from the disease.
Symptoms of MERS
These symptoms include:
breathlessness
coughing
nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting, in some cases
Complications include pneumonia and kidney failure.
The illness spreads through close contact with people who have the infection.
People aged 1–99 years have had MERS, and severe symptoms were more common among older people and those with underlying health conditions or weakened immune systems.
Transmission
Coronavirus infections are contagious, and some of these viruses, including the one that causes COVID-19, spread easily between people.
Researchers believe that the viruses transmit via fluids from the respiratory system.
Transmission may happen when a person:
coughs or sneezes without covering their mouth, dispersing droplets containing the virus into the air
has physical contact with someone who has the infection
touches a surface that contains the virus, then touches their nose, eyes, or mouth
Ways of preventing transmission include:
wearing a face covering in public
avoiding touching the face, especially the mouth and nose
always coughing or sneezing into a tissue, then disposing of it and washing the hands right away
regularly and thoroughly washing the hands
During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, people should also do the following, even if they are well:
Stay home whenever possible.
Avoid contact with others.
Wear a face covering in public.
Stay at least 6 feet away from others in public.
Anyone with symptoms of COVID-19 should isolate at home and rest until the symptoms have passed.
Contact a doctor for more information, and let them know if the symptoms seem to be worsening.
Vaccines can help prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2.
Summary
Coronaviruses are present in humans and other animals, and some types can cause severe illness.
The common cold is one illness that can result from a coronavirus.
Others include SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.
Scientists continue to investigate coronaviruses and monitor for new types and outbreaks.
Spraying chlorine or alcohol on the skin kills viruses in the body
Applying alcohol or chlorine to the skin can cause harm, especially if it enters the eyes or mouth.
These chemicals can disinfect surfaces, but people should not use them on their bodies.
Also, these products cannot kill viruses inside the body.
Only older adults and people with preexisting conditions are at risk of infections and complications
SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, can transmit to people of any age.
However, older adults and individuals with preexisting health conditions, such as diabetes, obesity, or asthma, are more likely to become severely ill.
While people under 40, including children, are less likely to become severely ill with COVID-19, the disease can lead to complications and death in anyone.
Children cannot get COVID-19
Anyone, of any age, can develop the infection that causes COVID-19.
So far, most COVID-19 cases have been in adults, but children are not immune.
That said, most children who develop COVID-19 have mild symptoms or none at all.
Also, on May 15, 2020, the WHO released a commentary about an inflammatory condition in children and adolescents that may have links with COVID-19.
The condition, called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, known as MIS-C, has features similar to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome.
Scientists currently know little about this condition, but research from May suggests that it is rare, “probably affecting no more than 1 in 1,000 children exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
COVID-19 is just like the flu
Infection with the virus SARS-CoV-2 can cause COVID-19, an illness that can cause flu-like symptoms, such as body aches, a fever, and a cough.
Symptoms of either COVID-19 or the flu can be mild, severe, or rarely, fatal.
Both illnesses can also cause pneumonia.
However, the overall profile of COVID-19 is more serious.
Different countries have reported different mortality rates, and the case fatality rate in the U. S. appears to be around 2.6%.
While scientists are still determining the exact mortality rate based on developing data, it is likely to be many times higher than that of the seasonal flu.
Learn about the differences between COVID-19 and the flu here.
Everyone with COVID-19 dies
This is false.
As we explain above, COVID-19 is fatal for a small percentage of people who develop the illness.
The WHO have reported that around 80% of people with COVID-19 experience a relatively form of the illness and do not need specialist treatment in a hospital.
Mild symptoms may include a fever, a cough, a sore throat, tiredness, and shortness of breath.
Also, many people with the underlying infection experience no symptoms.
Cats and dogs spread the coronavirus
There have been several reports of pets developing the infection, including in the U. S.
In most cases, the pets became sick after coming into contact with people who had COVID-19.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source, “There is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19.
Scientists are debating the importance of these cases in animals.
For instance, Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, in the United Kingdom, says:
“We have to differentiate between real infection and just detecting the presence of the virus.
I still think it’s questionable how relevant it is to the human outbreak, as most of the global outbreak has been driven by human-to-human transmission.
Face masks always protect against the coronavirus
Healthcare workers use professional face masks that fit tightly to protect themselves from infections.
Disposable and cloth masks can protect against droplets, but neither can protect against aerosolized particles.
The CDCTrusted Source recommend that all people wear cloth face masks in public areas where it is difficult to maintain a 6-foot, or 2-meter, distance from others.
This helps slow the spread of the virus.
Even while wearing a mask, it is essential to continue with other precautions, such as not touching the face, physical distancing, and washing the hands frequently.
Instructions for making masks at home are available here.
Surgical masks and N95 respirators provide greater protection, but reserve these for healthcare workers.
Hand dryers kill the coronavirus
Hand dryers do notTrusted Source kill SARS-CoV-2.
The best way to protect oneself and others from the virus is to wash the hands with soap and water frequently for at least 20 seconds at a time.
When this is not possible, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
SARS-CoV-2 is just a mutated form of the common cold virus
Coronaviruses are a large family, and each has spiky proteins on their surface.
Some use humans as their primary host and cause the common cold.
Other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, primarily infect animals.
Like COVID-19, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are caused by coronaviruses.
These viruses also initially passed to humans from animals.
You have to be with someone for 10 minutes to catch the virus
The longer a person is close to someone with the infection, the likelier the virus is to transmit.
However, the virus can pass from person to person in under 10 minutes.
Rinsing the nose with saline protects against the coronavirus
There is no evidence that a saline nasal rinse protects against any respiratory infections.
Some research suggests that a rinse might ease the symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infections, but scientists have not found that this technique reduces the risk of infection.
You can protect yourself by gargling bleach
People should never put bleach in their mouths.
Gargling bleach could never benefit a person’s health.
Bleach is corrosive and can cause serious damage.
Antibiotics kill the coronavirus
Antibiotics only kill bacteria.
They do not kill viruses.
Thermal scanners can diagnose the coronavirus
Thermal scanners can detect whether someone has a fever — which might result from any number of health issues.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can appear 2–14 days after the infection develops.
This means that even if a person develops symptoms, they may have a normal temperature for days before a fever begins.
Garlic protects against coronaviruses
Some research suggests that garlic may slow the growth of some species of bacteria.
COVID-19 results from a virus, not bacteria.
There is no evidence that garlic can protect people from COVID-19.
Parcels from China can spread the coronavirus
From previous research into coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2, including those that cause SARS and MERS, scientists believe that the virus cannot survive on letters or packages for extended periods.
The CDCTrusted Source explain that “Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products, or packaging.
Home remedies can cure and protect against COVID-19
No home remedies can protect against COVID-19.
This goes for vitamin C, essential oils, silver colloid, sesame oil, garlic, fish tank cleaner, sage, or water, even when a person sips it every 15 minutes.
The best approach is to wash the hands frequently, for 20 seconds at a time, to use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, to wear a face covering in public, and to avoid crowded places.
You can catch the coronavirus from eating Chinese food in the US
No, you cannot.
You can catch the coronavirus from urine and feces
This is likely false, but the jury is currently out.
According to Prof.
John Edmunds, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, in the U. K.:
“It isn’t a very pleasant thought, but every time you swallow, you swallow mucus from your upper respiratory tract.
In fact, this is an important defensive mechanism.
This sweeps viruses and bacteria down into our gut where they are denatured in the acid conditions of our stomachs.
“With modern, very highly sensitive detection mechanisms, we can detect these viruses in feces.
Usually, the viruses that we can detect in this way are not infectious to others, as they have been destroyed by our guts.
However, it is worth noting that some research suggests that viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 might persist in feces.
A research letter in JAMA also concludes that SARS-CoV-2 is present in feces.
The virus will die off when temperatures rise
Some viruses, such as cold and flu viruses, spread more easily in colder months.
This does not mean that their transmission stops in warmer weather.
As it stands, scientists do not know how temperature changes influence the behavior of SARS-CoV-2.
The coronavirus is the deadliest virus known to humans
While SARS-CoV-2 does appear to be more dangerous than influenza viruses, it is not the deadliest virus that people have faced.
Others, such as the Ebola virus, have higher mortality rates.
Flu and pneumonia vaccines can protect against COVID-19
Because SARS-CoV-2 is distinct from other viruses, no existing vaccines can protect against it.
The virus originated in a laboratory in China
There is no evidence to back up this rumor, which has circulated on the internet.
As a recent study demonstrates, SARS-CoV-2 is a natural product of evolution.
Some researchers believe that SARS-CoV-2 jumped from pangolins to humans.
Others think that it passed to us from bats, like SARS did.
The outbreak began because people ate bat soup
While scientists are confident that the virus started in animals, there is no evidence that soup was involved.
5G helps SARS-CoV-2 spread
As the world becomes more connected, some regions are rolling out 5G mobile technology.
This has prompted a raft of conspiracy theories.
One of the most recent to emerge is that 5G is responsible for the swift spread of SARS-CoV-2 across the globe.
This is a myth.
Some people believe that 5G helps viruses communicate, often citing a paper from 2011.
In this study, the authors conclude that bacteria can communicate via electromagnetic signals.
However, experts dispute this theory.
In any case, SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, not a bacterium.
Wuhan was one of the first cities to trial 5G in China, which helps explain the origin of some of these theories.
However, Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou also rolled out 5G at a similar time.
It is also worth noting that COVID-19 has significantly impacted countries with very little 5G coverage, such as Iran.
Learn about the health implications of 5G in depth here.
Drinking alcohol reduces the risk of infection
The WHO have released a response to the series of myths surrounding alcohol and COVID-19.
They explain that while alcohol can disinfect the skin, it does not have this effect inside the body.
They continue, “Consuming any alcohol poses health risks, but consuming high-strength ethyl alcohol (ethanol), particularly if it has been adulterated with methanol, can result in severe health consequences, including death.
Also, in a fact sheet on the subject, they explain that “Alcohol use, especially heavy use, weakens the immune system — and thus reduces the ability to cope with infectious diseases.
And because alcohol is associated with a number of diseases, it may make people more vulnerable to COVID-19.
Injecting or consuming bleach or disinfectant kills the virus
Consuming or injecting disinfectant or bleach does not wipe out viruses in the body, and it can be extremely dangerous.
As Dr. Wayne Carter, an associate professor at the University of Nottingham’s Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences, in the U.K. explains, “Disinfectants and bleach are strong oxidizing agents, useful to kill bacteria or viruses when they are deposited on surfaces, but these agents should not be ingested or injected.
These agents can cause severe tissue burns and blood vessel damage.
Dr. Penny Ward, a visiting professor of pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London, in the U.K., notes, “Drinking bleach kills.
Injecting bleach kills faster.
You can contract the coronavirus in swimming pools
As the CDCTrusted Source observe, no evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 transmits via the water in swimming pools, hot tubs, or water parks.
If this water is disinfected with chlorine or bromine, it should inactivate the virus.
Still, the virus can transmit in all the usual ways in these and any other shared spaces.
A person contracts a SARS-CoV-2 infection by inhaling respiratory droplets that contain the virus or coming into contact with infected surfaces.
As in other public places, the CDC recommend staying 6 feet, or 2 meters, away from others at pools and water parks and wearing cloth face coverings when not in the water.
People who operate pools should take extra care to clean and disinfect all facilities.
In a follow-up article, we explore 5 persistent myths about COVID-19 and shed light on the roles of vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc.
If you get a COVID-19 vaccine, you will no longer transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others
The question as to whether the currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines might stop SARS-CoV-2 transmission altogether has arisen in the context of speculations about “vaccine passports.
Such documentation would, in theory, allow people who have had a COVID-19 vaccine to move freely once again.
However, at present there is not enough evidence to prove whether or not thecurrently authorized vaccinesstop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
The trial results for the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna-NIAID, and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines so far suggest they are effective in preventing symptoms of COVID-19.
However, research on whether or not these vaccines and other vaccine candidates are also likely to prevent transmission is lacking.
What should we do?
The CDC recommend the following simple ways to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2:
avoiding close contact with people who seem ill or report symptoms
trying not to touch the eyes, nose, or mouth
staying home if any symptoms appear
sneezing into a tissue, then throwing it in the trash, or sneezing into the crook of the elbow
using standard cleaning sprays and wipes to disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces
washing the handsTrusted Source with soap regularly, for at least 20 seconds at a time
using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer when soap and water are unavailable
wearing a cloth face covering in stores, pharmacies, and other public settings
What is SARS-CoV-2?
SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that target and affect mammals’ respiratory systems.
There are four main ranks of coronaviruses: alpha, beta, delta, and gamma.
Most of these only affect animals, but some of the alpha and beta types can pass to humans.
Only two coronaviruses have previously caused global outbreaks.
The SARS coronavirus — responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) — started spreading in 2002 in China.
It mainly affected the populations of mainland China and Hong Kong, and it disappeared in 2003.
The MERS coronavirus — responsible for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) — emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
It has led to 858 deathsTrusted Source since then.
Where did the virus originate?
When humans first contract a coronavirus, it usually results from contact with an infected animal.
Some of the most common carriers are bats, though they do not typically transmit coronaviruses directly to humans.
Instead, the virus might pass through an intermediary animal, which will usually, though not always, be a domestic one.
The SARS coronavirus spread to humans via civet cats, while the MERS virus spread via dromedaries, a type of camel.
However, determining which type of animal is transmitting a coronavirus to humans can be difficult.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, initial reports from China tied the outbreak to a seafood market in central Wuhan.
As a result, local authorities closed down the market on January 1, 2020.
However, later assessments suggested that this market was unlikely to be the single source of the coronavirus outbreak, as some people with the virus early on had no connection with it.
Specialists have not yet been able to determine the true source of the virus or even confirm whether there was a single original reservoir.
When MNT contacted the WHO for comment, their spokespeople emphasized:
“We don’t yet know [what the specific source of SARS-CoV-2 was].
Researchers in China are studying this but have not yet identified a source.
How is the virus transmitted?
Although it likely originated in animals, SARS-CoV-2 now transmits directly between people.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warn that people can pass on the virus even if they never have symptoms of the infection.
A person can also transmit the virus before symptoms appear.
This asymptomatic period usually lasts for 2–14 days after exposure to the virus.
For this reason, everyone should take steps to prevent transmission, such as:
washing the hands frequently
wearing a face-covering in public
staying at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others
avoiding crowded places
How does it compare with other viruses?
In January 2020 scientists found that, genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is most similar to two bat coronaviruses: bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21.
Its genomic sequence is 88% the same as theirs.
The same study showed that the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 is about 79% the same as that of the SARS coronavirus and approximately 50% the same as that of the MERS virus.
Earlier research suggested that pangolins may have been the initial propagators of SARS-CoV-2 among humans, as the virus’s genomic sequence appears to be 99% the same as that of a coronavirus specific to these animals.
More recent research, however, including a study from October 2020, emphasizes that pangolins, bats, and other animals are not to blame for epidemics or pandemics affecting humans.
Instead, the real triggers are societal structures that drive human-animal contact.
Blaming wildlife can also lead to unnecessary slaughter and the devastating loss of wildlife biodiversity, the researchers explain.
What are its symptoms?
As with other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 causes symptoms of respiratory disease.
According to the CDCTrusted Source, the symptoms of COVID-19 can include:
shortness of breath and difficulty breathing
nausea or vomiting
A study published in The Lancet reports that around 81%Trusted Source of people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms and do not require hospitalization.
“Current information suggests that the virus can cause mild flu-like symptoms as well as more severe disease.
Most [people] seem to have mild disease, and up to 20% appear to progress to more severe disease, including pneumonia, respiratory failure, and in some cases, death,” WHO spokespeople told MNT.
In an official WHO interview in early 2020, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove explained that because the symptoms of COVID-19 can be very generic, it can be difficult to distinguish between them and the symptoms of other respiratory infections.
To understand exactly what a person is dealing with, she said, specialists test viral samples, checking to see whether the virus’s RNA structure matches that of SARS-CoV-2.
Now, tests are widely available in many countries.
People who may have symptoms of COVID-19 or may have had exposure to the virus can seek a test to confirm whether the virus is present in their body.
What is its impact?
The WHO officially classified COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
In a declaration, WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated:
“[The] WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock, and we are deeply concerned, both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction.
We have, therefore, made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic.
‘Pandemic’ is not a word to use lightly or carelessly.
It is a word that, if misused, can cause unreasonable fear or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death.
Describing the situation as a pandemic does not change [the] WHO’s assessment of the threat posed by this virus.
It doesn’t change what [the] WHO is doing, and it doesn’t change what countries should do.
The global implications have been severe.
Since March 2020, schools have closed, people have worked from home when possible, and many businesses have closed their doors, some for good.
Countries have closed their international borders and discouraged travel unless it is deemed essential.
In the U. S.,the White House set guidelines advising people to physically distance, avoid large gatherings, and practice good hygiene.
Some states also have their own measures.
Find out about state and local guidance here.
Meanwhile, many questions remain about the nature of SARS-CoV-2 and what the future holds, especially now that new variants are emerging.
Reported mortality rates vary from country to country.
The current COVID-19 case fatality rate in the U. S. appears to be around 1.7%.
This number is lower than it was earlier in the pandemic — but that is partly because more people are undergoing tests, even when they have mild or no symptoms.
In response to questions about this, WHO spokespeople told MNT: “This is a new disease, and our understanding is changing rapidly.
We will continue to analyze information on both current and any new cases.
“With MERS, we know that approximately 35% of reported patients with [MERS coronavirus] infection have died.
[The] WHO estimated that the case fatality ratio of SARS ranges from 0–50%, depending on the age group affected, with an overall estimate of case fatality of 14–15%.
Experts no longer consider SARS a risk.
The WHO report that since 2003, there have only been a few cases of the disease, resulting from laboratory accidents or, possibly, transmission from animals.
According to research, SARS-CoV-2 seems to be more infectious than other coronaviruses — such as those that cause SARS and MERS — but less likely to lead to death.
However, the CDC note that older adults and people of any age with certain health conditions, such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and some heart-related issues have a higher risk of severe illness due to COVID-19.
Reports suggest that COVID-19 seems to be equally prevalent among all genders but that males are more likely than females to have worse outcomes and death rates.
This difference may be due to biological, behavioral, or social factors.
There have been fewer reported cases of COVID-19 in children than in adults.
Children tend to have mild or no symptoms.
However, infants under 1 year old and children with certain medical conditions might have an increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19.
Some children with COVID-19 have developed a rare but serious condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, known as MIS-C.
The condition has features similar to those of Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome.
This syndrome is rare.
Researchers are still investigating its causes and possible connection with COVID-19.
During pregnancy, people may have an increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 and a higher risk of some complications, such as preterm birth.
It is uncommon for a pregnant person to transmit COVID-19 to a newborn, but it can happen.
A study from the United Kingdom published in May 2020 and currently available online in preprint form, found that Black women and women of marginalized ethnic groups accounted for more than half of the pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19.
This finding is among a mounting body of evidence that COVID-19 has a disproportionate effect on people who are Black, Asian, or of other marginalized ethnicities.
Some experts explain that this stems from widespread discrimination and systemic racism in healthcare.
How can we prevent infection?
Prevention guidelines urge people to have excellent personal hygiene and avoid close contact with others.
Experts believe that SARS-CoV-2 transmits through respiratory droplets.
The CDC recommend maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet (2 meters)from other people to avoid contact with these droplets.
There is currently no evidence that the virus transmits through eating food or drinking water.
A person could contract the virus from touching contaminated food packaging, but experts believe that this is not the main way that the virus spreads.
People should wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds at a time before preparing or eating food.
The CDC recommend wearing a cloth face covering when out in public, such as when going to the grocery store.
This is to slow the spread of the virus and prevent its transmission — which can occur even among people who have no symptoms.
Learn how to make face masks here.
People who have symptoms or believe they may have been exposed to the virus can seek a test.
State and local health department websites have information about testing facilities.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved some COVID-19 home testing kits.
Using the cotton swab in the kit, a person can collect a nasal sample and mail it to a designated laboratory for testing.
Are there any treatments?
There is currently no cure for COVID-19, but some treatments may help manage symptoms.
Most people do not need hospital care but should rest at home and avoid all contact with others.
Symptoms generally improve in about 2 weeks, according to an ongoing survey in the U. K.
People with severe symptoms may need to spend time in a hospital.
They may need oxygen therapy and the use of a mechanical respirator.
In the U. S.,two drugs have approval specifically for use against COVID-19 in hospitals.
Remdesivir (Veklury), is an antiviral drug that may slow the progress of the underlying virus.
The other is dexamethasone (Decadron), a corticosteroid that can help manage inflammation.
What steps are researchers taking?
Over the years, researchers have looked into treatments and vaccines for other coronaviruses, and these may prove useful against the virus that causes COVID-19.
A drug that already has approval for other uses is more likely to be safe.
The FDA have a special emergency program to investigate potential COVID-19 treatments.
As of January 2021, they have reviewed more than 400 trials, and more than 591 drug development programs are underway.
Several large international trials are also ongoing in the search for a treatment.
The WHO launched the largest of these, which is called Solidarity and involves more than 100 countries.
Medications
So far, only dexamethasone and remdesivir have approval for use in the U. S.,where their respective brand names are Decadron and Veklury.
Other relevant treatments that have approval for emergency use only in the U. S. are:
convalescent plasmaTrusted Source
bamlanivimab, a monoclonal antibody
baricitinib (Olumiant), a Janus kinase inhibitor
Several drugs are currently in phase 3 clinical trials, which are late-stage, large-scale studies.
These include:
tocilizumab (Actemra), an immunosuppressant drug that doctors use to treat arthritis
bucillamine, another anti-arthritis drug
apixaban (Eliquis), a blood thinner
heparin, another blood thinner
The FDA withdrew emergency approval for the malaria drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine after new evidence suggested that the risks of taking each outweighed the benefits for people with COVID-19.
Vaccines
Researchers have been racing to find a vaccine to prevent COVID-19.
Two vaccines currently have FDA approvalTrusted Source for use in the U. S.
These are the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the Moderna vaccine.
A vaccination program started in the U. S. in December 2020.
The vaccine itself is free.
A person may need to pay an administrative fee, however.
This will be reimbursed by insurance companies or the Department of Health and Human Services.
Other vaccines are under development, and some others already have approval for use in other countries.
Coronavirus testing: How does it work?
How do the tests work?
Where are the tests?
Accuracy
Who needs testing?
Most tests for COVID-19 involve taking a swab sample from the back of the nose, throat, or both.
But some tests require a blood sample.
These tests aim to find out if a person has, or has ever had, an infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
This is the virus that causes coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
A molecular or antigen test can tell whether a person currently has the infection, regardless of whether they have any symptoms.
A serological, or antibody, test shows whether the body has antibodies to the virus.
It cannot show whether a person has an active infection.
If antibodies are present, it suggests that the body has already dealt with SARS-CoV-2.
Currently, more than 415,000,000 tests have been carried out in the United States.
More than 8.
23% of the results have been positive.
This article will explore how COVID-19 tests work, which ones are available, when to have a test, and how to find one.
Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak and visit our coronavirus hub for more advice on prevention and treatment.
A test for a SARS-CoV-2 infection often requires a swab sample.
There are several waysTrusted Source to test for evidence of the virus.
A person may have one of the following types of COVID-19 test.
Molecular tests
Molecular tests look for signs of a current infection.
One type of molecular test for the virus that causes COVID-19 is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.
This is sometimes called a nucleic acid amplification test.
A person performing a molecular test usually takes a sample from the back of the throat, the nose, or both using a long cotton swab.
A person might take their own swab sample at home.
RT-PCR test
This involves a healthcare professional collecting a sample and sending it to a laboratory for testing.
The analysis can detect signs of the virus’s genetic material in the sample.
This test can confirm a diagnosis of COVID-19 if it identifies two specific SARS-CoV-2 genes.
If it identifies only one, it will produce an inconclusive result.
Antigen tests
Ways of taking a swab for a COVID test: Check the test instructions to find out which location is recommended.
An antigen test is sometimes called a lateral flow test.
It detects proteins produced by the virus.
This is a rapid test that people can take at home using a small device that resembles a home pregnancy test.
After taking a sample using the swab provided, the person dips the swab in a vial of fluid.
They then insert the swab, which now contains some fluid, into a small device.
As the fluid spreads through the device, a line should appear in a screen on the device.
This is a control line that shows if the test is working correctly.
After some time — maybe 15 minutes, depending on the specific test — another line may appear.
If this happens, the result is positive for the virus.
If the second line does not appear, the result is likely negative.
Molecular tests can only help diagnose current infections.
They cannot tell whether someone has had COVID-19 in the past and recovered.
Serological tests
These detect antibodies the body produces to fight SARS-CoV-2.
The antibodies are present in blood and tissues of anyone who has recovered from COVID-19.
Serological tests require a blood sample.
While they are useful indicators of a past SARS-CoV-2 infection, these tests may also detect antibodies produced to combat other types of coronavirus.
So if the result is positive, it does not necessarily mean that the person has had COVID-19.
Where can you get a test?
In the U. S.,tests are available at health centers and some pharmacies in every state.
Some areas have dedicated testing centers.
Schools, workplaces, and other organizations may also have testing programs.
The tests themselves are free of charge to everyone, regardless of their insurance status.
However, if a person gets their test as part of a doctor’s visit, there may be costs.
Some people require a prescription for a test, and some tests are only available in certain locations.
An at-home test may produce a result right away, or a person may have to send their sample to a laboratory for analysis.
In some cases, a collection service is available.
Rapid tests, also called direct-to-consumer or over-the-counter tests, are also available for purchase online, often without a prescription.
Make sure that any such test has authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Not all tests are suitable for everyone.
Contact a healthcare professional or visit the local health department’s website to learn about the available options and confirm which type of test is appropriate.
Are they accurate?
No test is 100% reliable, as the FDA note, and it is possible to have a false-negative or false-positive result.
This may happen if the person takes the test incorrectly or takes it too soon after exposure to the virus.
If a person has a positive result, there is a high chance that they have COVID-19.
They should take precautions such as isolating and monitoring for symptoms.
If the result is negative but the person has symptoms, they should also isolate.
Their result may be a false negative.
Antigen tests may be less accurate than RT-PCT tests.
The FDA point out that if a person has symptoms but gets a negative result from an antigen test, it may be a good idea to have an RT-PCR test and self-isolate.
If a person has a negative result and no symptoms, they do not need to isolate but should continue to wear a face covering in public and practice physical distancing.
Whether an antibody test result is positive or negative, continue to take precautions, such as wearing a face covering.
The result does not guarantee immunity and does not mean that the person cannot pass on the virus.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that if a contact tests positive for the virus, their contacts should stay home for 14 days after their last encounter with that person.
This is not necessary, however, for people who are fully vaccinated and have no symptoms or people who have recovered from COVID-19 in the last 3 months.
When should you get tested?
As the CDCTrusted Source note, a person should consider testing if:
They have symptoms of COVID-19, such as a cough or fever.
They have been within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes in any 24-hour period of someone who has tested positive.
They have been in a setting where exposure may have occurred, such as a crowded train.
Their healthcare department or another authority asks them to have a test.
Learn about the different types of vaccines and their possible side effects.
People do not need a test if:
They are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, even if they have had exposure to someone with the underlying infection.
They have tested positive and recovered from the infection within the last 3 months — unless they develop new symptoms.
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?
Access to testing facilities has expanded significantly in some countries over the last year.
In the U. S.,many testing options are now available.
The two main types are diagnostic tests, typically involving a swab, and antibody tests, which is usually require a blood sample.
A diagnostic test can show if a person has a current SARS-CoV-2 infection, and an antibody test can show if they have had one in the past and recovered.
In the U. S.,anyone who needs a test can access one for free.
They can find out how to do this from their local health department.
There is a new public health crises threatening the world with the emergence and spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The virus originated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown intermediary animals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019.
There have been around 96,000 reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 3300 reported deaths to date (05/03/2020).
The disease is transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 d.
The symptoms are usually fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise among others.
The disease is mild in most people; in some (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction.
Many people are asymptomatic.
The case fatality rate is estimated to range from 2 to 3%.
Diagnosis is by demonstration of the virus in respiratory secretions by special molecular tests.
Common laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP).
The computerized tomographic chest scan is usually abnormal even in those with no symptoms or mild disease.
Treatment is essentially supportive; role of antiviral agents is yet to be established.
Prevention entails home isolation of suspected cases and those with mild illnesses and strict infection control measures at hospitals that include contact and droplet precautions.
The virus spreads faster than its two ancestors the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), but has lower fatality.
The global impact of this new epidemic is yet uncertain.
The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as it is now called, is rapidly spreading from its origin in Wuhan City of Hubei Province of China to the rest of the world.
Till 05/03/2020 around 96,000 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 3300 deaths have been reported.
India has reported 29 cases till date.
Fortunately so far, children have been infrequently affected with no deaths.
But the future course of this virus is unknown.
This article gives a bird’s eye view about this new virus.
Since knowledge about this virus is rapidly evolving, readers are urged to update themselves regularly.
History
Coronaviruses are enveloped positive sense RNA viruses ranging from 60 nm to 140 nm in diameter with spike like projections on its surface giving it a crown like appearance under the electron microscope; hence the name coronavirus.
Four corona viruses namely HKU1, NL63, 229E and OC43 have been in circulation in humans, and generally cause mild respiratory disease.
There have been two events in the past two decades wherein crossover of animal betacorona viruses to humans has resulted in severe disease.
The first such instance was in 2002–2003 when a new coronavirus of the β genera and with origin in bats crossed over to humans via the intermediary host of palm civet cats in the Guangdong province of China.
This virus, designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus affected 8422 people mostly in China and Hong Kong and caused 916 deaths (mortality rate 11%) before being contained.
Almost a decade later in 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), also of bat origin, emerged in Saudi Arabia with dromedary camels as the intermediate host and affected 2494 people and caused 858 deaths (fatality rate 34%).
Origin and Spread of COVID-19
In December 2019, adults in Wuhan, capital city of Hubei province and a major transportation hub of China started presenting to local hospitals with severe pneumonia of unknown cause.
Many of the initial cases had a common exposure to the Huanan wholesale seafood market that also traded live animals.
The surveillance system (put into place after the SARS outbreak) was activated and respiratory samples of patients were sent to reference labs for etiologic investigations.
On December 31st 2019, China notified the outbreak to the World Health Organization and on 1st January the Huanan sea food market was closed.
On 7th January the virus was identified as a coronavirus that had >95% homology with the bat coronavirus and > 70% similarity with the SARS- CoV.
Environmental samples from the Huanan sea food market also tested positive, signifying that the virus originated from there.
The number of cases started increasing exponentially, some of which did not have exposure to the live animal market, suggestive of the fact that human-to-human transmission was occurring.
The first fatal case was reported on 11th Jan 2020.
The massive migration of Chinese during the Chinese New Year fuelled the epidemic.
Cases in other provinces of China, other countries (Thailand, Japan and South Korea in quick succession) were reported in people who were returning from Wuhan.
Transmission to healthcare workers caring for patients was described on 20th Jan, 2020.
By 23rd January, the 11 million population of Wuhan was placed under lock down with restrictions of entry and exit from the region.
Soon this lock down was extended to other cities of Hubei province.
Cases of COVID-19 in countries outside China were reported in those with no history of travel to China suggesting that local human-to-human transmission was occurring in these countries.
Airports in different countries including India put in screening mechanisms to detect symptomatic people returning from China and placed them in isolation and testing them for COVID-19.
Soon it was apparent that the infection could be transmitted from asymptomatic people and also before onset of symptoms.
Therefore, countries including India who evacuated their citizens from Wuhan through special flights or had travellers returning from China, placed all people symptomatic or otherwise in isolation for 14 d and tested them for the virus.
Cases continued to increase exponentially and modelling studies reported an epidemic doubling time of 1.
8 d.
In fact on the 12th of February, China changed its definition of confirmed cases to include patients with negative/ pending molecular tests but with clinical, radiologic and epidemiologic features of COVID-19 leading to an increase in cases by 15,000 in a single day.
As of 05/03/2020 96,000 cases worldwide (80,000 in China) and 87 other countries and 1 international conveyance (696, in the cruise ship Diamond Princess parked off the coast of Japan) have been reported.
It is important to note that while the number of new cases has reduced in China lately, they have increased exponentially in other countries including South Korea, Italy and Iran.
Of those infected, 20% are in critical condition, 25% have recovered, and 3310 (3013 in China and 297 in other countries) have died.
India, which had reported only 3 cases till 2/3/2020, has also seen a sudden spurt in cases.
By 5/3/2020, 29 cases had been reported; mostly in Delhi, Jaipur and Agra in Italian tourists and their contacts.
One case was reported in an Indian who traveled back from Vienna and exposed a large number of school children in a birthday party at a city hotel.
Many of the contacts of these cases have been quarantined.
These numbers are possibly an underestimate of the infected and dead due to limitations of surveillance and testing.
Though the SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats, the intermediary animal through which it crossed over to humans is uncertain.
Pangolins and snakes are the current suspects.
Epidemiology and Pathogenesis
All ages are susceptible.
Infection is transmitted through large droplets generated during coughing and sneezing by symptomatic patients but can also occur from asymptomatic people and before onset of symptoms.
Studies have shown higher viral loads in the nasal cavity as compared to the throat with no difference in viral burden between symptomatic and asymptomatic people.
Patients can be infectious for as long as the symptoms last and even on clinical recovery.
Some people may act as super spreaders; a UK citizen who attended a conference in Singapore infected 11 other people while staying in a resort in the French Alps and upon return to the UK.
These infected droplets can spread 1–2 m and deposit on surfaces.
The virus can remain viable on surfaces for days in favourable atmospheric conditions but are destroyed in less than a minute by common disinfectants like sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide etc.
Infection is acquired either by inhalation of these droplets or touching surfaces contaminated by them and then touching the nose, mouth and eyes.
The virus is also present in the stool and contamination of the water supply and subsequent transmission via aerosolization/feco oral route is also hypothesized.
As per current information, transplacental transmission from pregnant women to their fetus has not been described.
However, neonatal disease due to post natal transmission is described.
The incubation period varies from 2 to 14 d [median 5 d].
Studies have identified angiotensin receptor 2 (ACE2) as the receptor through which the virus enters the respiratory mucosa.
The basic case reproduction rate (BCR) is estimated to range from 2 to 6.
47 in various modelling studies.
In comparison, the BCR of SARS was 2 and 1.
3 for pandemic flu H1N1 2009.
Clinical Features
The clinical features of COVID-19 are varied, ranging from asymptomatic state to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi organ dysfunction.
The common clinical features include fever (not in all), cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue, headache, myalgia and breathlessness.
Conjunctivitis has also been described.
Thus, they are indistinguishable from other respiratory infections.
In a subset of patients, by the end of the first week the disease can progress to pneumonia, respiratory failure and death.
This progression is associated with extreme rise in inflammatory cytokines including IL2, IL7, IL10, GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα.
The median time from onset of symptoms to dyspnea was 5 d, hospitalization 7 d and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 8 d.
The need for intensive care admission was in 25–30% of affected patients in published series.
Complications witnessed included acute lung injury, ARDS, shock and acute kidney injury.
Recovery started in the 2nd or 3rd wk.
The median duration of hospital stay in those who recovered was 10 d.
Adverse outcomes and death are more common in the elderly and those with underlying co-morbidities (50–75% of fatal cases).
Fatality rate in hospitalized adult patients ranged from 4 to 11%.
The overall case fatality rate is estimated to range between 2 and 3%.
Interestingly, disease in patients outside Hubei province has been reported to be milder than those from Wuhan.
Similarly, the severity and case fatality rate in patients outside China has been reported to be milder.
This may either be due to selection bias wherein the cases reporting from Wuhan included only the severe cases or due to predisposition of the Asian population to the virus due to higher expression of ACE2 receptors on the respiratory mucosa.
Disease in neonates, infants and children has been also reported to be significantly milder than their adult counterparts.
In a series of 34 children admitted to a hospital in Shenzhen, China between January 19th and February 7th, there were 14 males and 20 females.
The median age was 8 y 11 mo and in 28 children the infection was linked to a family member and 26 children had history of travel/residence to Hubei province in China.
All the patients were either asymptomatic (9%) or had mild disease.
No severe or critical cases were seen.
The most common symptoms were fever (50%) and cough (38%).
All patients recovered with symptomatic therapy and there were no deaths.
One case of severe pneumonia and multiorgan dysfunction in a child has also been reported.
Similarly the neonatal cases that have been reported have been mild [20].
Diagnosis
A suspect case is defined as one with fever, sore throat and cough who has history of travel to China or other areas of persistent local transmission or contact with patients with similar travel history or those with confirmed COVID-19 infection.
However cases may be asymptomatic or even without fever.
A confirmed case is a suspect case with a positive molecular test.
Specific diagnosis is by specific molecular tests on respiratory samples (throat swab/ nasopharyngeal swab/ sputum/ endotracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage).
Virus may also be detected in the stool and in severe cases, the blood.
It must be remembered that the multiplex PCR panels currently available do not include the COVID-19.
Commercial tests are also not available at present.
In a suspect case in India, the appropriate sample has to be sent to designated reference labs in India or the National Institute of Virology in Pune.
As the epidemic progresses, commercial tests will become available.
Other laboratory investigations are usually non specific.
The white cell count is usually normal or low.
There may be lymphopenia; a lymphocyte count <1000 has been associated with severe disease.
The platelet count is usually normal or mildly low.
The CRP and ESR are generally elevated but procalcitonin levels are usually normal.
A high procalcitonin level may indicate a bacterial co-infection.
The ALT/AST, prothrombin time, creatinine, D-dimer, CPK and LDH may be elevated and high levels are associated with severe disease.
The chest X-ray (CXR) usually shows bilateral infiltrates but may be normal in early disease.
The CT is more sensitive and specific.
CT imaging generally shows infiltrates, ground glass opacities and sub segmental consolidation.
It is also abnormal in asymptomatic patients/ patients with no clinical evidence of lower respiratory tract involvement.
In fact, abnormal CT scans have been used to diagnose COVID-19 in suspect cases with negative molecular diagnosis; many of these patients had positive molecular tests on repeat testing.
Differential Diagnosis [21]
The differential diagnosis includes all types of respiratory viral infections [influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, non COVID-19 coronavirus], atypical organisms (mycoplasma, chlamydia) and bacterial infections.
It is not possible to differentiate COVID-19 from these infections clinically or through routine lab tests.
Therefore travel history becomes important.
However, as the epidemic spreads, the travel history will become irrelevant.
Treatment
Treatment is essentially supportive and symptomatic.
The first step is to ensure adequate isolation (discussed later) to prevent transmission to other contacts, patients and healthcare workers.
Mild illness should be managed at home with counseling about danger signs.
The usual principles are maintaining hydration and nutrition and controlling fever and cough.
Routine use of antibiotics and antivirals such as oseltamivir should be avoided in confirmed cases.
In hypoxic patients, provision of oxygen through nasal prongs, face mask, high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or non-invasive ventilation is indicated.
Mechanical ventilation and even extra corporeal membrane oxygen support may be needed.
Renal replacement therapy may be needed in some.
Antibiotics and antifungals are required if co-infections are suspected or proven.
The role of corticosteroids is unproven; while current international consensus and WHO advocate against their use, Chinese guidelines do recommend short term therapy with low-to-moderate dose corticosteroids in COVID-19 ARDS.
Detailed guidelines for critical care management for COVID-19 have been published by the WHO.
There is, as of now, no approved treatment for COVID-19.
Antiviral drugs such as ribavirin, lopinavir-ritonavir have been used based on the experience with SARS and MERS.
In a historical control study in patients with SARS, patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir with ribavirin had better outcomes as compared to those given ribavirin alone.
In the case series of 99 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection from Wuhan, oxygen was given to 76%, non-invasive ventilation in 13%, mechanical ventilation in 4%, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in 3%, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in 9%, antibiotics in 71%, antifungals in 15%, glucocorticoids in 19% and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in 27%.
Antiviral therapy consisting of oseltamivir, ganciclovir and lopinavir-ritonavir was given to 75% of the patients.
The duration of non-invasive ventilation was 4–22 d [median 9 d] and mechanical ventilation for 3–20 d.
In the case series of children discussed earlier, all children recovered with basic treatment and did not need intensive care.
There is anecdotal experience with use of remdeswir, a broad spectrum anti RNA drug developed for Ebola in management of COVID-19.
More evidence is needed before these drugs are recommended.
Other drugs proposed for therapy are arbidol (an antiviral drug available in Russia and China), intravenous immunoglobulin, interferons, chloroquine and plasma of patients recovered from COVID-19.
Additionally, recommendations about using traditional Chinese herbs find place in the Chinese guidelines.
Prevention [21, 30]
Since at this time there are no approved treatments for this infection, prevention is crucial.
Several properties of this virus make prevention difficult namely, non-specific features of the disease, the infectivity even before onset of symptoms in the incubation period, transmission from asymptomatic people, long incubation period, tropism for mucosal surfaces such as the conjunctiva, prolonged duration of the illness and transmission even after clinical recovery.
Isolation of confirmed or suspected cases with mild illness at home is recommended.
The ventilation at home should be good with sunlight to allow for destruction of virus.
Patients should be asked to wear a simple surgical mask and practice cough hygiene.
Caregivers should be asked to wear a surgical mask when in the same room as patient and use hand hygiene every 15–20 min.
The greatest risk in COVID-19 is transmission to healthcare workers.
In the SARS outbreak of 2002, 21% of those affected were healthcare workers.
Till date, almost 1500 healthcare workers in China have been infected with 6 deaths.
The doctor who first warned about the virus has died too.
It is important to protect healthcare workers to ensure continuity of care and to prevent transmission of infection to other patients.
While COVID-19 transmits as a droplet pathogen and is placed in Category B of infectious agents (highly pathogenic H5N1 and SARS), by the China National Health Commission, infection control measures recommended are those for category A agents (cholera, plague).
Patients should be placed in separate rooms or cohorted together.
Negative pressure rooms are not generally needed.
The rooms and surfaces and equipment should undergo regular decontamination preferably with sodium hypochlorite.
Healthcare workers should be provided with fit tested N95 respirators and protective suits and goggles.
Airborne transmission precautions should be taken during aerosol generating procedures such as intubation, suction and tracheostomies.
All contacts including healthcare workers should be monitored for development of symptoms of COVID-19.
Patients can be discharged from isolation once they are afebrile for atleast 3 d and have two consecutive negative molecular tests at 1 d sampling interval.
This recommendation is different from pandemic flu where patients were asked to resume work/school once afebrile for 24 h or by day 7 of illness.
Negative molecular tests were not a prerequisite for discharge.
At the community level, people should be asked to avoid crowded areas and postpone non-essential travel to places with ongoing transmission.
They should be asked to practice cough hygiene by coughing in sleeve/ tissue rather than hands and practice hand hygiene frequently every 15–20 min.
Patients with respiratory symptoms should be asked to use surgical masks.
The use of mask by healthy people in public places has not shown to protect against respiratory viral infections and is currently not recommended by WHO.
However, in China, the public has been asked to wear masks in public and especially in crowded places and large scale gatherings are prohibited (entertainment parks etc).
China is also considering introducing legislation to prohibit selling and trading of wild animals.
The international response has been dramatic.
Initially, there were massive travel restrictions to China and people returning from China/ evacuated from China are being evaluated for clinical symptoms, isolated and tested for COVID-19 for 2 wks even if asymptomatic.
However, now with rapid world wide spread of the virus these travel restrictions have extended to other countries.
Whether these efforts will lead to slowing of viral spread is not known.
A candidate vaccine is under development.
Practice Points from an Indian Perspective
At the time of writing this article, the risk of coronavirus in India is extremely low.
But that may change in the next few weeks.
Hence the following is recommended:
Healthcare providers should take travel history of all patients with respiratory symptoms, and any international travel in the past 2 wks as well as contact with sick people who have travelled internationally.
They should set up a system of triage of patients with respiratory illness in the outpatient department and give them a simple surgical mask to wear.
They should use surgical masks themselves while examining such patients and practice hand hygiene frequently.
Suspected cases should be referred to government designated centres for isolation and testing (in Mumbai, at this time, it is Kasturba hospital).
Commercial kits for testing are not yet available in India.
Patients admitted with severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome should be evaluated for travel history and placed under contact and droplet isolation.
Regular decontamination of surfaces should be done.
They should be tested for etiology using multiplex PCR panels if logistics permit and if no pathogen is identified, refer the samples for testing for SARS-CoV-2.
All clinicians should keep themselves updated about recent developments including global spread of the disease.
Non-essential international travel should be avoided at this time.
People should stop spreading myths and false information about the disease and try to allay panic and anxiety of the public.
Conclusions
This new virus outbreak has challenged the economic, medical and public health infrastructure of China and to some extent, of other countries especially, its neighbours.
Time alone will tell how the virus will impact our lives here in India.
More so, future outbreaks of viruses and pathogens of zoonotic origin are likely to continue.
Therefore, apart from curbing this outbreak, efforts should be made to devise comprehensive measures to prevent future outbreaks of zoonotic origin.
COVID-19 and its economic toll on women: The story behind the numbers
Riya Akter, 22, is an apparel worker, just like her husband.
Asked if she was afraid of becoming infected with coronavirus, she said work came first and needed to be done, otherwise there would not be food on the table.
She works while maintaining social distance with other workers as ready made garment (RMG) factories reopened amid the Covid-19 pandemic in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
Riya Akter, 22, is an apparel worker.
Asked if she was afraid of becoming infected with COVID-19, she said work came first and needed to be done, otherwise there would not be food on the table.
The impacts of crises are never gender-neutral, and COVID-19 is no exception.
At a glance
Economic crises hit women harder.
Here’s why:
Women tend to earn less.
Women have fewer savings.
Women are disproportionately more in the informal economy.
Women have less access to social protections.
Women are more likely to be burdened with unpaid care and domestic work, and therefore have to drop out of the labour force
Women make up the majority of single-parent households.
For the single mother in South Sudan, COVID-19 lockdown measures have paused her small business that brings food to the table.
For the domestic worker in Guatemala, the pandemic has meant no job and no unemployment benefits or other protection.
For countless women in economies of every size, along with losing income, unpaid care and domestic work burden has exploded.
While everyone is facing unprecedented challenges, women are bearing the brunt of the economic and social fallout of COVID-19.
Women who are poor and marginalized face an even higher risk of COVID-19 transmission and fatalities, loss of livelihood, and increased violence.
Globally, 70 per cent of health workers and first responders are women, and yet, they are not at par with their male counterparts.
At 28 per cent, the gender pay gap in the health sector is higher than the overall gender pay gap (16 per cent).
Here’s how COVID-19 is rolling back on women’s economic gains of past decades, unless we act now, and act deliberately.
The future of the poverty gender gap
A slowing economy, job losses and lack of social protection are expected to push millions more into poverty - and women and girls are no exception.
Data forecasts the future of poverty in a post-#COVID19 world.
“For the last 22 years, extreme poverty globally had been declining.
Then came COVID-19, and with it, massive job losses, shrinking of economies and loss of livelihoods, particularly for women.
Weakened social protection systems have left many of the poorest in society unprotected, with no safeguards to weather the storm,” says Ginette Azcona, lead author of UN Women’s latest report From Insights to Action and UN Women’s Senior Research and Data Specialist.
The recently released report shows that the pandemic will push 96 million people into extreme poverty by 2021, 47 million of whom are women and girls.
This will bring the total number of women and girls living on USD 1.
90 or less, to 435 million.
The pandemic-induced poverty surge will also widen the gender poverty gap – meaning, more women will be pushed into extreme poverty than men.
This is especially the case among those aged 25 to 34, at the height of their productive and family formation period.
In 2021, it is expected there will be 118 women aged 25 to 34 in extreme poverty for every 100 men aged 25 to 34 in extreme poverty globally, and this ratio could rise to 121 poor women for every 100 poor men by 2030.
The resurgence of extreme poverty as a result of the pandemic has revealed women’s precarious economic security,” adds Antra Bhatt, Statistics Specialist and co-author of the report From Insights to Action.
“Women typically earn less and hold less secure jobs than men.
With plummeting economic activity, women are particularly vulnerable to layoffs and loss of livelihoods.
Women’s paid labour and women-run businesses will be hit hard(est)
Women are losing their jobs.
The pandemic and measures to prevent its spread are driving a disproportionate increase in women’s unemployment (as compared to men) and also decreasing their overall working time.
In South Sudan, Margaret Raman, a single mother of five who sells beans and groundnuts at a local market, lost more than 50 per cent of her income as social distancing guidelines drastically reduced the number of people visiting the market.
Margaret Raman selling beans and groundroots, before COVID-19 slowed her business to a stall.
“Our businesses have been growing, only to be disrupted by COVID-19,” she said.
“Since COVID-19, our lives have not been the same.
Under normal circumstances, I make about SSP 28,000 [USD 100] in a week.
This has recently been reduced to below half, SSP 10,000 [USD 34] a week.
Raman’s story is playing out in other parts of the world too.
Since the start of the pandemic, in Europe and Central Asia, 25 per cent of self-employed women have lost their jobs, compared to 21 per cent of men –– a trend that is expected to continue as unemployment rises.
Projections from the International Labour Organization suggest the equivalent of 140 million full-time jobs may be lost due to COVID-19; and women’s employment is 19 per cent more at risk than men.
These women are the faces behind the headlines, the people most affected by the economic impact of COVID-19 Unless, policies intentionally enable economic relief measures and deliberately target women, support women-led businesses and their income security, their situation will only worsen.
The most impacted industries have more women
Women are overrepresented in many of the industries hardest hit by COVID-19, such as food service, retail and entertainment.
For example, 40 per cent of all employed women – 510 million women globally – work in hard-hit sectors, compared to 36.
6 per cent of employed men.
Ryancia Henry who works in the hospitality industry in the United States.
“The financial impact on hospitality alone has just been so staggering,” said Ryancia Henry, a 32-year-old Caribbean national working in the hospitality industry in the United States of America.
“I worry for myself depending on how long this goes on, what kind of decisions do I have to make, to be financially okay, and I have the same concerns for my team.
I send some funds home, to help my mom.
I worry about maintaining some payments.
Within some of these sectors where informal employment is common, workers were already subject to low pay, poor working conditions and lacking social protection ( pension, healthcare, unemployment insurance) before the pandemic.
Globally, 58 per cent of employed women work in informal employment, and estimates suggest that during the first month of the pandemic, informal workers globally lost an average of 60 per cent of their income.
When everyone stayed home, they sent the domestic workers packing
For domestic workers, 80 per cent of whom are women, the situation has been dire: around the world, a staggering 72 per cent of domestic workers have lost their jobs.
Even before the pandemic, paid domestic work, like many other informal economy jobs, lacked basic worker protections like paid leave, notice period or severance pay.
When the COVID-19 crisis came to Timor-Leste, Ana Paula Soares, a 27-year-old who has been her family’s breadwinner since 2017, lost her income and was left with no way to support her family.
Her story is the same as millions of women workers in the informal economy.
“It’s hard to make money at this time.
People who work at the office, they continue to work from home and earn their salary regularly; but domestic workers cannot.
Domestic workers should also be entitled to a salary during times of crisis,” said Soares.
“Some didn’t even receive their salary when they were asked to stop in the middle of the month.
I wish all employers would treat their employees equally.
In the absence of help from employers, domestic workers in Latin America have been organizing their own networks of assistance.
Workers associations and unions are playing a critical role: “Their response has been truly admirable,” said Adriana Paz, coordinator for Latin America at the International Domestic Workers Federation.
“They have raised funds, door to door, at the local level and with political authorities.
They have organized community kitchens [and] have brought food to their affiliates’ plates.
“Domestic workers’ associations and unions are among the few organizations that have brought relief to the poorest neighbourhoods,” added Paz.
Inequality at home and unpaid care
As quarantine measures keep people at home, close schools and day-care facilities, the burden of unpaid care and domestic work has exploded.
Both for women and men.
But even before COVID-19, women spent an average of 4.
1 hours per day performing unpaid work, while men spent 1.
7 hours – that means women did three times more unpaid care work than men, worldwide.
Both men and women report an increase in unpaid work since the start of the pandemic, but women are continuing to shoulder the bulk of that work.
School and daycare closures, along with the reduced availability of outside help, have led to months of additional work for women.
For working mothers, this has meant balancing full-time employment with childcare and schooling responsibilities.
The responsibility of caring for sick and elderly family members often falls on women as well.
In Serbia, a call-in counselling centre run by the non-profit organization Amity, offers support to those who are lonely or overwhelmed with care and housework during the lockdown.
“Most of the calls we get are from either older or younger women who care for their older relatives and family members, who found themselves in an endless cycle of cooking, cleaning and care at home during the lockdown,” said Nada Sataric, founder of Amity.
“Now is the time to acknowledge this unpaid care work and redistribute this burden.
Poverty and gaps in basic services and infrastructure add to women’s unpaid workload.
Globally, around 4 billion people lack access to safely managed sanitation facilities, and roughly 3 billion lack clean water and soap at home.
In these situations, women and girls are the ones tasked with water collection and other tasks necessary for day-to-day survival.
The consequences will outlast the pandemic
What we know from previous crises
In general, increased unemployment tends to encourage people to go back to traditional gender roles: unemployed men are favored more heavily in the hiring process when jobs are scarce, while unemployed women take on more household and care work.
During the 2008 economic crisis, the diversion of government funds toward relief efforts culminated in major cuts to social services and benefits, with heavy impacts on women.
During the recent Ebola outbreak, quarantines significantly reduced women’s economic activity, driving a spike in poverty and food insecurity.
While men’s economic activity rebounded quickly, women’s did not.
Economic insecurity is not just jobs, and income loss today.
It has a snowball effect on the lives of women and girls for years to come.
Impacts on education and employment have long lasting consequences that, if unaddressed, will reverse hard-won gains in gender equality.
Estimates show that an additional 11 million girls may leave school by the end of the COVID crisis;
evidence from previous crises suggests that many will not return.
A widening education gender gap has serious implications for women, including a significant reduction in what they earn and how, l and an increase in teen pregnancy and child marriage.
Lack of education and economic insecurity also increase the risk of gender-based violence.
Without sufficient economic resources, women are unable to escape abusive partners and face a greater threat of sexual exploitation and trafficking.
These consequences won’t disappear when the pandemic subsides: women are likely to experience long-term setbacks in work force participation and income.
Impacts on pensions and savings will have implications for women’s economic security far down the road.
The fallout will be most severe for the most vulnerable women among us, those who are rarely in the headlines: migrant workers, refugees, marginalized racial and ethnic groups, single-parent households, youth and the world’s poorest.
Those who have recently escaped extreme poverty will likely fall back into it.
Recovery efforts must reach women
“Despite the clear gendered implications of crises, response and recovery efforts tend to ignore the needs of women and girls until it’s too late.
We need to do better,” urges UN Women’s Chief Statistician, Papa Seck.
“But most countries are either not collecting or not making available data broken down by sex, age and other characteristics – such as class, race, location, disability and migrant status.
These acute data gaps make it extremely difficult to predict the pandemic’s full impact in countries and communities.
They also raise the concern that COVID-19 policy response will ignore the priorities of the most vulnerable women and girls.
Here are five steps that governments and businesses can take to mitigate the negative economic impacts of COVID-19 on women.
Direct income support to women
Introduce economic support packages, including direct cash-transfers, expanded unemployment benefits, tax breaks, and expanded family and child benefits for vulnerable women and their families.
Direct cash-transfers, which would mean giving cash directly to women who are poor or lack income, --can be a lifeline for those struggling to afford day-to-day necessities during this pandemic.
These measures provide tangible help that women need right now.
Support for women-owned and -led businesses
Businesses owned and led by women should receive specific grants and stimulus funding, as well as subsidized and state-backed loans.
Tax burdens should be eased and where possible, governments should source food, personal protection equipment, and other essential supplies from women-led businesses.
Economic relief should similarly target sectors and industries where women are a large proportion of workers.
Support for women workers
Implement gender-responsive social protection systems to support income security for women.
For instance, expanded access to affordable and quality childcare services will enable more women to be in the labour force.
Bridging the gender pay gap is urgent, and it begins by enacting laws and policies that guarantee equal pay for work of equal value and stop undervaluing the work done by women.
Support for informal workers
Provide social protection and benefits to informal workers.
For informal workers left unemployed, cash transfers or unemployment compensation can help ease the financial burden, as can deferring or exempting taxes and social security payments for workers in the informal sector.
Reconciliation of paid and unpaid work
Provide all primary caregivers with paid leave and reduced or flexible working arrangements.
Provide essential workers with childcare services.
Unprecedented measures to address the economic fallout have already been taken, but comparatively few measures have been directed at supporting families grappling with paid and unpaid work, including care needs.
More efforts are also needed to engage citizens and workers in public campaigns that promote equitable distribution of care and domestic work between men and women.
Lung Transplants for COVID-19—The Option of Last Resort
After many weeks on a ventilator in the intensive care unit (ICU) at Chicago’s Northwestern Memorial Hospital, 28-year-old Mayra Ramirez was critically ill with COVID-19.
A paralegal who had enjoyed running 5K races, her lungs were now ravaged.
She developed severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)—a respite for her lungs that provided oxygen by continuously pumping her blood through an artificial lung machine.
She had sepsis and her kidneys and liver were beginning to fail.
Ramirez couldn’t be weaned off of ECMO or sedation and was listed for a lung transplant.
In June 2020, Ankit Bharat, MD, chief of thoracic surgery and surgical director of lung transplantation and respiratory ECMO at Northwestern, performed a bilateral lung transplant, giving Ramirez the distinction of being the first person in the US known to have undergone the procedure to treat COVID-19.
Since Ramirez’s surgery, other patients have followed suit.
According to data from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), the nonprofit organization that manages the US organ transplant system, 134 lung transplants have been reported in the US for patients with COVID-19 through May 21.
Among them, 82 patients had ARDS, 48 had developed pulmonary fibrosis, and 4 had unspecified lung failure due to COVID-19.
In addition, 1 heart-lung transplant has been performed for COVID-19–related pulmonary fibrosis and heart failure.
As of May 28, 22 patients with COVID-19–related lung failure were still on the lung transplant wait-list.
Bharat recently took time out from his surgical schedule to speak with JAMA about his experience performing Ramirez’s lung transplant for COVID-19.
The following is an edited version of that conversation.
JAMA:On June 5, 2020, you performed the first successful double lung transplant in the US for a patient with ARDS due to COVID-19.
Can you tell us about the decision-making process that occurred prior to the surgery?
Dr Bharat:At the start of the pandemic, we saw a number of patients progress to severe and catastrophic lung damage despite the best medical treatment available.
At that point, we started to explore the possibility of lung transplant as a lifesaving intervention for these patients.
But a number of questions remained unanswered, including “Can we definitively say these lungs are permanently damaged by coronavirus or the secondary effects of the virus?
So, we started a warm autopsy program, which to the best of our knowledge was the first of its kind in the nation.
Within 1 hour of a patient’s death, we performed an autopsy to help understand the anatomy inside the chest and to collect tissues to study the structural framework of the lungs.
In our research laboratories, we developed techniques that for the first time proved that some patients had permanent and much more severe structural framework damage than in end-stage lung diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis and α1-antitrypsin deficiency.
Our second major question was “Can we be certain that the virus has been cleared from the host?
We didn’t want to perform a lung transplant, give these patients immunosuppressants, and then have the virus reactivate.
So we did time-course studies, which informed us of the [average] duration of time needed for the virus to be cleared from the lungs.
These findings were published as a scientific paper in Science Translational Medicine on December 16, 2020.
JAMA:How much time elapsed between placing your first COVID-19 patient on the transplant list and receiving the donor lungs?
Dr Bharat:For the first patient, it only took 2 days.
Most patients receiving lung transplants for COVID-19 have been on ECMO with maximum ventilator support, so they get a high lung allocation score.
Also, the majority of these patients have blood types O and A, which are 2 of the most frequent blood types in our donors, so they tend to get the organs pretty quickly.
JAMA:Can you describe how the operation and recovery process went for your first lung transplant for COVID-19 and what you have learned doing these operations?
Dr Bharat:Our first recipient had severe deconditioning, malnourishment, sepsis, acute kidney injury, a necrotizing pneumonia, and spontaneous bleeding into a lung and her liver.
This is not the typical profile of standard lung transplant patients who, for the most part, are on oxygen but come from home and have participated in outpatient pulmonary and physical rehabilitation so are fairly strong.
Also, the surgery itself is much more challenging for patients with COVID-19.
While a typical double lung transplant takes about 6 hours, in patients with COVID-19 the average operative time is 10 to 12 hours.
These patients have scar tissue in the chest that is actively inflamed and tends to bleed a lot, requiring an average of 10 units of blood transfusion in the operating room compared with 5½ units of blood for a typical double lung transplant recipient.
Postoperatively, patients with COVID-19 have a higher incidence of primary graft dysfunction early on and tend to have a much longer ICU stay.
But once they get beyond the first couple of weeks, they tend to recover quickly and catch up to the trajectory of a standard lung transplant by about 4 to 6 weeks.
All the patients with COVID-19 in whom we’ve performed lung transplants so far have had 100% survival.
JAMA:As of now, in mid-May, how many lung transplants have you performed in patients with COVID-19?
Dr Bharat:We’ve done 19 so far.
JAMA:How long were these patients in the ICU on full support before undergoing a lung transplant?
Dr Bharat:Most patients with COVID-19 who have undergone lung transplant at our center have waited close to 3 months or longer.
We’ve transplanted several patients who have been on ECMO for about 5 months.
JAMA:Lung transplants are being performed in the US for patients with COVID-19 who have developed ARDS or pulmonary fibrosis.
Have you performed lung transplants for both of these COVID-19–related lung failure conditions?
Dr Bharat:The patients with ARDS have been the bulk of the patients with COVID-19 for whom we have performed lung transplants.
We’ve focused on them because they have no other options and would die otherwise.
But we have also done 2 lung transplants in patients who developed pulmonary fibrosis from COVID-19.
I think the need for lung transplant will increase in that group of patients in the imminent future because we are seeing a significant surge in patients who recovered from moderate to severe COVID and are now coming to the outpatient setting with progressive oxygen requirements and pulmonary fibrosis.
JAMA:Are only double lung transplants being performed for patients with COVID-19?
Dr Bharat:Patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 need a double lung transplant because their lungs are severely damaged.
But I do think that there may be a role for single lung transplants in patients who develop chronic pulmonary fibrosis from COVID-19.
JAMA:Do you currently have any patients with COVID-19 on the wait-list for a lung transplant?
Dr Bharat:Yes, we have at least 5 patients right now waiting for lung transplants.
And we are in the process of evaluating a number of others as well.
JAMA:Can you describe important considerations for evaluating patients with COVID-19 for lung transplantation?
Dr Bharat:Lung transplantation obviously is a very resource-intensive treatment.
There is a scarcity of donor lungs so we don’t want to perform a lung transplant in a patient who will not be compliant with medical guidance afterward.
It’s important for the transplant centers to ensure that, from the psychosocial perspective, this is going to be a good fit.
The patients with COVID-19 generally being considered as candidates for lung transplant are, for the most part, young and healthy and without major comorbid conditions.
So they haven’t ever been in a situation where they almost died or had to talk about a transplant vs no other option.
Most of these patients agree to undergo lung transplant, but it’s our job to make sure they fully understand.
And this also includes a financial assessment because these patients need to have health insurance, and since they will be taking medications for the rest of their lives, medication co-payments cannot be an impediment.
JAMA:Have you been able to obtain consent from all of your patients who have undergone lung transplant for COVID-19?
Dr Bharat:Our first patient who received a lung transplant for COVID-19 was so sick that we had to proceed to transplant using her medical power of attorney.
But subsequently, every patient has been able to participate in the decision-making process.
JAMA:You recently published an article in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine about survival after lung transplantation for COVID-19 in 4 countries.
Can you describe the major findings?
Dr Bharat:The main message was that despite how sick these patients are, in the experienced centers we can achieve excellent outcomes.
The 12 patients included in our paper had a 30-day survival of 100%, and their long-term survival did not differ from patients without COVID-19 who received lung transplants in the same centers during the same period.
A caveat is that these lung transplants need to be done at high-volume centers that have surgical and multidisciplinary expertise.
A second message of that paper was that the mortality of patients undergoing lung transplants at these centers has not changed.
We can absolutely continue to perform transplants in patients without COVID-19 along with those with COVID-19.
However, that does require some creative thinking by using expanded donor criteria, such as donors with hepatitis C infection, which is now a treatable disease.
JAMA:Can you discuss this paper’s proposed criteria for selecting patients with COVID-19 for lung transplant?
Dr Bharat:We typically use age 65 years as the cutoff for lung transplantation in patients with COVID-19, but up to 70 years of age may be considered if a patient was in exceptionally good condition prior to the illness.
While for a standard transplant we would perhaps not consider patients with active infection or frailty, this is allowed with COVID-19 as long as other criteria for lung transplant are met.
Additionally, because we know that patients with obesity are predisposed to severe COVID-19 and we didn’t want to exclude them solely based on body mass index (BMI), we relaxed the BMI criteria for lung transplant in these patients.
We proposed that every center wait a minimum of 4 weeks before considering transplantation in a patient with severe ARDS from COVID-19.
We also emphasized that if a patient is still on a ventilator or ECMO at the end of 4 to 6 weeks but their lungs are getting better, centers should not rush to lung transplant but instead continue to give that patient a chance for lung recovery.
We strongly suggested that patients being considered for lung transplant should have 2 negative results of polymerase chain reaction tests of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the lungs performed 24 hours apart to ensure clearance of SARS-CoV-2.
JAMA:We do not yet have data about long-term survival for patients with lung transplants for COVID-19, but can you tell us about typical survival rates after lung transplant?
Dr Bharat:Of all the lung transplants performed in the US, both single and double transplants, the 30-day survival is about 98%, which is the same at our center.
One-year survival approaches 90%, but obviously that number will vary based on the risk profiles of individual patients.
At 3 years, survival after lung transplant is about 75% to 78%.
By the 5-year mark, we expect 60% to 70% of these patients to be alive and independent in terms of their day-to-day activities.
JAMA:Did the cause of death of organ donors change substantially during the pandemic compared with prepandemic statistics?
Dr Bharat:Lung transplant donor deaths were less frequently due to car accidents and gunshot wounds during this time, but we saw a significant increase in the number of organ donor deaths from suicide, opioid overdose, and stroke.
JAMA:Has the number of donated organs changed substantially during the pandemic compared with prepandemic figures?
Dr Bharat:The number of organ donations absolutely decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Early on, the processes responsible for getting a brain-dead donor to an organ procurement organization were strained, and these organizations were short-staffed.
As the pandemic evolved, organ donations started to slowly go up, but there was still a significant decline in the number of lungs available for transplant, partly because clinicians were initially worried about doing bronchoscopy on potential donors due to possible COVID-19 infection.
Without bronchoscopy—an essential part of donor management—donor lungs were not being offered for transplant.
Additionally, while other organs from donors who had recovered from COVID-19 were being transplanted, there was a big concern about whether lungs from a patient who had COVID-19 could be used.
To the best of our knowledge, we performed the first COVID-to-COVID transplant, which involved transplanting lungs from a donor who had recovered from COVID-19 and appeared not to have lung damage into another patient with COVID-19 infection.
As of today, close to 33 million people in the US have been diagnosed with COVID-19.
Some reports have suggested that up to 80% of these patients, even many who were asymptomatic, can have demonstrable lung injury.
It remains to be seen whether or not other patients who have recovered from mild, moderate, or even severe COVID-19 are going to be organ donors.
If not, this may lead to a significant contraction of our donor pool.
Everything you should know about the coronavirus pandemic
The latest information about the novel coronavirus identified in Wuhan, China, and advice on how pharmacists can help concerned patients and the public.
Viral infections
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society has made this feature article free to access in order to help healthcare professionals stay informed about an issue of national importance.
To learn more about coronavirus, please visit: https://www.rpharms.com/resources/pharmacy-guides/wuhan-novel-coronavirus.
A novel strain of coronavirus — SARS-CoV-2 — was first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, a city in China’s Hubei province with a population of 11 million, after an outbreak of pneumonia without an obvious cause.
The virus has now spread to over 200 countries and territories across the globe, and was characterised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020[1],[2].
As of 3 May 2021, there were 152,534,452 laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection globally, with 3,198,528 reported deaths.
The number of cases and deaths outside of China overtook those within the country on 16 March 2020[3].
As of 3 May 2021, there have been 4,421,850 confirmed cases of the virus in the UK and 127,539 of these have died (in all settings, within 28 days of the test).
This article gives a brief overview of the new virus and what to look out for, and will be updated weekly.
It provides answers to the following questions:
What are coronaviruses?
Where has the new coronavirus come from?
How contagious is COVID-19?
How is COVID-19 diagnosed?
What social distancing measures are being taken in the UK?
What is happening with testing for COVID-19?
What should I do if a patient thinks they have COVID-19?
What can I do to protect myself and my staff?
What about ‘business as usual’ during the pandemic?
Will the government provide financial help during the pandemic?
How can cross-infection be prevented?
There has been a lot of talk in the news and on social media about how certain medications can exacerbate the symptoms of COVID-19, what is the current advice around these medications?
Where can I find information on managing COVID-19 patients?
Is the coronavirus pandemic likely to precipitate medicines shortages?
Are there national clinical trials of potential drugs to treat COVID-19?
Is there a vaccine for COVID-19 and, if so, will pharmacy staff be involved in its roll out?
SARS-CoV-2 belongs to a family of single-stranded RNA viruses known as coronaviridae, a common type of virus which affects mammals, birds and reptiles.
In humans, it commonly causes mild infections, similar to the common cold, and accounts for 10–30% of upper respiratory tract infections in adults[4].
More serious infections are rare, although coronaviruses can cause enteric and neurological disease[5].
The incubation period of a coronavirus varies but is generally up to two weeks.
Previous coronavirus outbreaks include Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), first reported in Saudi Arabia in September 2012, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), identified in southern China in 2003[7],[8].
MERS infected around 2,500 people and led to more than 850 deaths while SARS infected more than 8,000 people and resulted in nearly 800 deaths[9],[10].
The case fatality rates for these conditions were 35% and 10%, respectively.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans.
Although the incubation period of this strain is currently unknown, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that symptoms may appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 days after exposure.
Chinese researchers have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 may be infectious during its incubation period.
The number of cases and deaths outside of China overtook those within it on 16 March 2020
It is currently unclear where the virus has come from.
Originally, the virus was understood to have originated in a food market in Wuhan and subsequently spread from animal to human.
Some research has claimed that the cross-species transmission may be between snake and human; however, this claim has been contested.
Mammals such as camels and bats have been implicated in previous coronavirus outbreaks, but it is not yet clear the exact animal origin, if any, of SARS-CoV-2.
Increasing numbers of confirmed diagnoses, including in healthcare professionals, has indicated that person-to-person spread of SARS-CoV-2 is occurring.
The preliminary reproduction number (i.e.the average number of cases a single case generates over the course of its infectious period) is currently estimated to be between 1.4 to 2.5, meaning that each infected individual could infect between 1.4 and 2.5 people.
Similarly to other common respiratory tract infections, MERS and SARS are spread by respiratory droplets produced by an infected person when they sneeze or cough.
There is also some evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can spread by airborne transmission.
Measures to guard against the infection work under the current assumption that SARS-CoV-2 is spread in the same manner.
As this coronavirus affects the respiratory tract, common presenting symptoms include fever and dry cough, with some patients presenting with respiratory symptoms (e. g. sore throat, nasal congestion, malaise, headache and myalgia) or even struggling for breath.
In severe cases, the coronavirus can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and death[18].
The case definition for COVID-19 is based on symptoms regardless of travel history or contact with confirmed cases.
Diagnosis is suspected in patients with a new, continuous cough, fever or a loss or changed sense of normal smell or taste (anosmia).
A diagnostic test has been developed, and countries are quarantining suspected cases[19].
Box 1: Who qualifies as a suspected COVID-19 case?
Individuals with:
New continuous cough AND/OR
Temperature ≥37.
8°C AND/OR
Anosmia (a loss or changed sense of normal smell or taste)
Individuals with any of the above symptoms but who are well enough to remain in the community should stay at home for 10 days from the onset of symptoms and get tested.
Households should all self-isolate for 10 days if one member shows symptoms.
Source: Department of Health and Social Care
The government launched its coronavirus action plan on 3 March 2020, which details four stages: contain, delay, mitigate, research[20].
On 12 March 2020, the UK moved to the delay phase of the plan and raised the risk level to ‘high’.
On 16 March 2020, Johnson announced social distancing measures, such as working from home and avoiding social gatherings, as well as household isolation for those with symptoms[21],[22].
Further social distancing measures were announced on 18 March 2020, including closing all schools in the UK except for vulnerable children and those of key workers, such as pharmacists and other health and social care staff, teachers and delivery drivers.
Restaurants, cafes, pubs, leisure centres, nightclubs, cinemas, theatres, museums and other businesses were also told to close.
On 22 March 2020, Johnson announced that the most clinically extremely vulnerable people, including those who have received organ transplants, are living with severe respiratory conditions or specific cancers, and some people taking immunosuppressants, should stay in their homes for at least the next 12 weeks (see Box 2).
Since this date, shielding in England, Scotland and Wales has been eased and brought back in several times in line with lockdown restrictions.
And on 16 February 2021, a new risk assessment model was introduced in England to help clinicians identify adults with multiple risk factors that make them more vulnerable to COVID-19, resulting in an additional 1.
7 million people being added to the shielding list.
Shielding ended in England and Wales on 1 April 2021 and in Scotland on 26 April 2021.
Box 2: Shielding from COVID-19
Those classed as “clinically extremely vulnerable” may include the following (disease severity, history or treatment levels will also affect who is in this group):
Solid organ transplant recipients
People with cancer who are undergoing active chemotherapy
People with lung cancer who are undergoing radical radiotherapy
People with cancers of the blood or bone marrow such as leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma who are at any stage of treatment
People having immunotherapy or other continuing antibody treatments for cancer
People having other targeted cancer treatments which can affect the immune system, such as protein kinase inhibitors or PARP inhibitors
People who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last 6 months, or who are still taking immunosuppression drugs
People with severe respiratory conditions including all cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
People with rare diseases that significantly increase the risk of infections (such as severe combined immunodeficiency, homozygous sickle cell)
People on immunosuppression therapies sufficient to significantly increase risk of infection
Adults with Down’s syndrome
Adults on dialysis or with chronic kidney disease (stage 5)
Women who are pregnant with significant heart disease, congenital or acquired
Other people who have also been classed as clinically extremely vulnerable, based on clinical judgement and an assessment of their needs.
GPs and hospital clinicians have been provided with guidance to support these decisions
A strict lockdown started in the UK on 23 March 2020, with people told to stay at home except to buy essential food and medicines, one form of exercise a day, any medical need, and travelling to and from essential work.
Gatherings of more than two people in public was not allowed and all shops selling non-essential goods, libraries, playgrounds, outdoor gyms and places of worship closed.
All social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals were cancelled.
A relaxation of the lockdown was announced by Johnson on 10 May 2020.
The government published a 60-page ‘recovery strategy’ on 11 May 2020, which sets out the next phases of the UK’s response to the virus, including easing some social restrictions, getting people back to work and reopening schools.
Local lockdowns were introduced at the end of June 2020 to try to control the spread of coronavirus in particular regions in England but cases continue to rise and a second national lockdown was imposed from 5 November 2020 for four weeks.
A three-tier system of restrictions will follow the national lockdown in England.
In Scotland, a five-level alert system was introduced on 2 November, which will allow different restrictions to be imposed in local areas depending on the prevalence of the infection.
A fire-break lockdown came into force in Wales from 23 October 2020, and ran until 9 November 2020.
On 19 December 2020, new tier-four restrictions were imposed in London, Kent and Essex and other parts of the South East of England, meaning that individuals in those areas had to stay at home and not meet up with other households.
On 31 December 2020, further areas of England including the Midlands, North East, parts of the North West and parts of the South West were also escalated to tier four.
A new national lockdown was imposed in England and Scotland from 5 January 2021, and similar restrictions were introduced in Wales shortly after.
The lockdowns began to lift in steps from the end of March 2021.
Tests can now be accessed by anyone with symptoms via nhs.
uk/coronavirus.
An NHS test and trace service was launched across England on 28 May 2020, with similar services starting in Scotland and Wales around the same time.
Anyone who tests positive for the virus is contacted to share information about their recent interactions.
People identified as being in close contact with someone who tests positive will have to self-isolate for 10 days, regardless of whether they have symptoms.
Testing is also now available to care home staff and residents in England, and NHS workers where there is a clinical need, whether or not they have symptoms.
Pharmacy staff in England and Scotland should book tests online via gov.
uk and they will be conducted at drive-through testing sites across the country, as well as via home testing kits.
Pharmacy staff in Wales with symptoms of COVID-19 are able to access testing through their Local Health Board.
The government has also announced the start of a new national antibody testing programme, with plans to provide antibody tests to NHS and care staff in England from the end of May 2020.
Clinicians will also be able to request the tests for patients in both hospital and social care settings if they think it is appropriate.
Regular testing of asymptomatic patient-facing staff delivering NHS services using lateral flow antigen tests was introduced in NHS trusts in November and expanded to primary care services in December 2020.
Patients have been advised not to go to their community pharmacy if they are concerned that they have COVID-19.
Those with a new, continuous cough or a high temperature or anosmia (a loss or changed sense of normal smell or taste) who live alone should self-isolate for 10 days from the onset of symptoms.
Households should all self-isolate for 10 days if one member shows symptoms[22].
There is no need for people with minor symptoms to telephone NHS 111.
However, given the outbreak has coincided with the cold and flu season, it is likely that patients may present in the pharmacy with queries about the virus, or with concerns about their cold or flu symptoms.
Community pharmacies were told by NHS England and NHS Improvement on 27 February 2020 that, in the unlikely event that a suspected case does present, they must prepare a “designated isolation space”[23].
If the pharmacy does not have a suitable room to isolate a suspected patient, an area that would keep a patient at least two metres away from staff and other patients in the pharmacy should be prepared so that it can be cordoned off.
Patients who present with a new, continuous cough or a high temperature or anosmia should be told to return home immediately and self-isolate.
If, in the clinical judgement of the pharmacist, the person is too unwell to return home, they and any accompanying family should be invited into the designated isolation space where emergency services should be contacted.
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society is publishing ongoing guidance on contingency planning for COVID-19, which includes measures to protect the pharmacy team, such as limiting the number of people within the pharmacy at the same time, keeping at least two metres apart from staff and people coming into the pharmacy, and sectioning the pharmacy to encourage social distancing with floor markings (using tape) or barriers.
The RPS has also produced a table to help pharmacists distinguish between COVID-19, a cold, the flu and hayfever.
Those with cold and flu symptoms that are not indicative of COVID-19 should be managed as usual, or using the pathway developed by The Pharmaceutical Journal.
The General Pharmaceutical Council said on 3 March 2020 that it recognises pharmacists may need to depart from established procedures in order to care for patients during the coronavirus outbreak and that regulatory standards are designed to be flexible and to provide a framework for decision-making in a wide range of situations.
In a joint statement with ten other health regulators, the GPhC said: “Where a concern is raised about a registered professional, it will always be considered on the specific facts of the case, taking into account the factors relevant to the environment in which the professional is working”.
An updated standard operating procedure (SOP) for community pharmacies, published on 22 March 2020, sets out measures to protect pharmacy staff, including advising customers to keep a distance of at least two metres from other people, limiting entry and exit to the pharmacy and installing full screens to protect members of staff from airborne particles (see Learning article section ‘Enforcing social distancing’ for further details).
Following some confusion early on in the pandemic about whether community pharmacists should wear personal protective equipment (PPE), Public Health England updated its guidance on 23 July 2020 to say that pharmacy staff, both in clinical and non-clinical roles, should wear a type I, type II or type IIR facemask if the environment is not COVID-19 secure, using social distancing, optimal hand hygiene, frequent surface decontamination, ventilation and other measures where appropriate.
This brings the PHE guidance in line with that from the RPS, which says that pharmacy staff working in community pharmacies and general practice should wear fluid-resistant surgical masks if they are unable to maintain a social distance of 2 metres from patients and staff, and emphasises that it is still important to try to maintain social distance when wearing surgical masks wherever possible.
The RPS also advises that gloves, apron and surgical masks should be worn by staff in direct contact with a patient, for example, when a person is too unwell to go home and is being cared for in the designated isolation space.
PPE can be ordered for free via the government’s PPE portal.
On 5 June 2020, the DHSC announced that all staff in hospitals in England will have to wear surgical masks from 15 June 2020, regardless of the clinical area in which they work.
Guidance has been issued by pharmacy organisations on how community pharmacies in England can accept patient returns of unwanted medicines while minimising risk to pharmacy teams.
Since coronaviruses can survive on certain surfaces for up to five days, it recommends that all returns should be double bagged and placed directly in waste medicines bins.
Controlled Drugs should be double bagged and placed in the CD cabinet for five days before denaturing.
A suggested procedure is detailed within the guidance.
Staff who have symptoms of COVID-19 should stay at home and get tested as soon as possible.
NHS England and Improvement confirmed in a letter to community pharmacies on 9 June 2020 that NHS staff “must self-isolate” for 14 days (reduced to 10 days from 14 December 2020) if the NHS test and trace service advises them to do so because they have come into close contact with a person with COVID-19.
However, the letter adds that close contact “excludes circumstances where PPE is being worn”.
If a member of the pharmacy team tests positive and there is a risk to the provision of pharmaceutical services then advice regarding the individual circumstances should be sought from the local Health Protection Team.
Staff who fall into one of the vulnerable groups at particular risk of complications from COVID-19 should not see patients face-to-face, regardless of whether the patient has possible COVID-19.
Remote working should be prioritised for these staff.
NHS staff from a black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) background and others who who may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 — including those working in community pharmacies — should be risk assessed.
In a letter dated 29 April 2020, NHS England said that “emerging UK and international data” suggest that people from BAME backgrounds are “being disproportionately affected by COVID-19”.
The Faculty of Occupational Medicine later published a risk reduction framework — backed by NHS England — to assist with the risk assessments on 14 May 2020.
This was updated on 28 May 2020 to include guidance from the Health and Safety Executive to “help organisations identify who is at risk of harm”.
All NHS staff can access free wellbeing support and frontline health and care staff can access NHS volunteer responders support for themselves by calling 0808 196 3646.
Pharmacies are on the frontline of the fight against coronavirus and demand for services is high.
An updated standard operating procedure published on 27 October 2020 enables regional NHS England and NHS Improvement teams to notify pharmacies that they are able to adjust their opening hours to cope with increased demand.
Pharmacies will be able to work behind closed doors for up to 2.
5 hours a day before 10am, between 12 and 2pm or after 4pm.
A number of contractual services have been put on hold and others have been brought forward (see Learning article section ‘Adjusting opening hours and pharmacy services’ for further details).
The Hepatitis C testing service in England will now launch on 1 September 2020 and the discharge medicines service is expected to start in February 2021.
During the first full lockdown in the spring of 2020, community pharmacies ensured that those who were shielding from COVID-19 (see Box 2) were able to receive their prescription medicines, either through friends and family, volunteers, or via pandemic delivery services but these were paused when cases dropped.
The pandemic delivery service in England resumed for four weeks from 5 November 2020 to 3 December 2020, and again from 5 January 2021 to 31 March 2021, owing to sustained community transmission of COVID-19; it was expanded to patients told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace on 16 March 2021 until 30 June 2021.
In Scotland, a pandemic delivery service started on 18 January 2021 and will continue until the end of March 2021.
Another new advanced service, distributing COVID-19 lateral flow test kits, was announced on 29 March 2021 for community pharmacies in England.
Pharmacies will be able to earn up to £972 per week by providing the test kits to asymptomatic patients as part of NHS Test and Trace.
The need for patients to sign the back of prescription forms has been suspended until 30 June 2021 so as to reduce cross contamination and minimise handling of paperwork.
Patients must still pay the prescription charge or prove their eligibility for exemption.
Pharmacy staff should mark the relevant box for exempt patients and annotate all forms with COVID-19 in place of a signature.
Amendments to legislation to allow community pharmacies to close, with the permission of NHS England, “to focus on the delivery of flu or COVID-19 vaccinations” will come into effect on 9 November 2020 to allow for “flexible provision of immunisation services during the pandemic”.
These changes follow the government’s decision to allow pharmacists to deliver unlicensed — in addition to licensed — vaccinations, such as a COVID-19 vaccine when one becomes available, with further work under way to expand the workforce able to deliver flu vaccines.
The amendments also allow community pharmacists in England to dispense COVID-19 treatments without a prescription under pandemic treatment protocols that will be issued by the government if a COVID-19 treatment became available that was suitable for distribution via community pharmacies and it was not found to be necessary for an authorised prescriber to decide to treat.
The General Pharmaceutical Council has stopped all routine inspections of pharmacies.
Submission of revalidation records is postponed for registrants who were due to submit between 20 March 2020 and 31 August 2020, and requirements have been reduced for those due to submit between 1 September 2020 and 31 December 2020.
On 26 March 2020, the GPhC announced that the pharmacy registration assessments for June and September 2020 have been postponed.
The GPhC confirmed on 30 November 2020 that online registration assessments would take place at centres around the UK on 17 and 18 March 2021.
More than 6,200 pharmacy professionals who left the register within the past three years have been given temporary registration so that they can to return to work during the COVID-19 pandemic, if they wish to do so.
And in guidance published on 9 April 2020, final year pharmacy students were told they can join their arranged preregistration workplace ahead of the scheduled start date to help deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.
The PSNC announced on 31 March 2020 that community pharmacies in England will be given cash advances totalling £300.
0m over the next two months to help with cashflow during the pandemic, but no extra funding has been negotiated so far.
Further advanced funding of £50m and
£20m at the end of May 2020 and June 2020, respectively, has since been announced by the PSNC.
As with the £300m previously announced, the £70m is not additional funding and will be reconciled in 2020/2021.
Advance payments have also been agreed for community pharmacies in Scotland and Wales.
Additional funding of an initial £5.
6m was agreed in Scotland on 7 April 2020 to support unparalleled levels of activity within community pharmacy during the pandemic.
The funding will cover equipment costs, adaptations to premises, additional staffing and locum fees.
Further additional funding of £4.
5m for staffing costs for May and June 2020 was announced on 27 November 2020.
On 2 April 2020, the government announced that it had written off £13.
4bn of debt as part of a major financial reset for NHS providers.
The WHO has created a range of infographics to illustrate how patients can protect themselves and others from getting sick; however, most of the advice is similar to what would be provided for colds and flu (see Figure)[24].

There is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
Although vaccines can be developed to treat viruses, owing to the novel nature of this infection, no vaccine has currently been developed and the process to develop one may take 12 to 18 months[18].
As an example, many antiviral agents have been identified to inhibit SARS in vitro, but there are currently no approved antiviral agents or vaccines available to tackle any potential SARS or SARS-like outbreaks, such as MERS or SARS-CoV-2[25].
On 16 March 2020, the British Cardiovascular Society and the British Society for Heart Failure published a statement saying that patients should continue treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers unless “specifically advised to stop by their medical team”.
The advice was issued following concerns circulated on social media that these medicines could predispose them to adverse outcomes should they become infected with COVID-19.
Both societies recommended that patients taking these medicines who present as unwell, or with a suspected or known COVID-19 infection, should be assessed on an individual basis and their medication managed according to established guidance.
Inappropriate cessation of therapy could lead to a decline in control of blood pressure, heart failure or any other condition the individuals takes these medicines for.
Similar concerns have also arisen around the use of ibuprofen following unverified claims, backed by Oliver Veran, France’s health minister, that ibuprofen may exacerbate symptoms of the virus.
On 14 April 2020, the Committee of Human Medicines (CHM) — an advisory body of Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency — and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence both published reviews, which concluded that there is insufficient evidence to establish a link between use of ibuprofen, or other NSAIDs, and susceptibility to contracting COVID-19 or the worsening of its symptoms.
A rapid policy statement published by NHS England on the same date, highlighted that there had been some reports of possible adverse effects of the use of NSAIDs in acute respiratory tract infections more generally, which had led to suggestions to use paracetamol preferentially for fever/pain in such situations.
However, it said that there was currently no evidence that the acute use of NSAIDs caused an increased risk of developing COVID-19 or of developing a more severe COVID-19 disease.
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society has collated resources for hospital pharmacists on the clinical management of patients with COVID-19, including treatments, use of experimental therapies, and evidence-based summaries.
The resources also include information on critical care services during the pandemic and guidance on COVID-19 in special populations, such as children, pregnant women, patients taking warfarin and those with cancer, respiratory conditions, diabetes, rheumatological conditions and HIV.
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has produced COVID-19 rapid guidelines covering a number of areas as well as rapid evidence summaries on COVID-19 treatments.
NHS England and NHS Improvement has also published several specialty guides aimed at specialists working in hospitals during the pandemic.
These resources have all been brought together on the NICE website.
NICE and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network are working with the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) to develop a guideline on the effects of long COVID on patients.
The government banned the parallel export of chloroquine, as well as the antiretroviral lopinavir/ritonavir, on 26 February 2020 because they are being tested as possible treatments for COVID-19.
There has been a lot of attention in the media on the potential benefits of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in treating patients with COVID-19 but the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency has warned that these medicines are not licensed to treat COVID-19 related symptoms or prevent infection and, until there is clear, definitive evidence that these treatments are safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19, they should only be used for this purpose within a clinical trial.
On 20 March 2020, the government banned from parallel export more than 80 medicines used to treat patients in intensive care units.
The restrictions cover crucial medicines such as adrenaline, insulin, paracetamol and morphine and are designed to prevent medicines shortages.
A further 52 medicines, including a number of respiratory medicines, antibiotics, analgesics and insulin products, were banned from export on 1 April 2020.
And a further 33 medicines were banned from export on 24 April 2020, including further respiratory medicines and some drugs that are being trialled for COVID-19, such as azithromycin, dexamethasone, ruxolitinib, sarilumab and tocilizumab.
Community pharmacists have been experiencing huge demand for paracetamol and many have reported shortages of paracetamol tablets 500mg as pharmacy and general sales list packs.
The National Pharmacy Association and the GPhC have both said that pharmacies are able to break down larger packs to prepare supplies of a non-prescription items for retail sale.
Shortages of Chiesi’s Clenil and Fostair inhalers, along with inhalers from other brands, have been noticed by pharmacists as patients begin to panic and order inhalers they potentially do not need.
The wholesaler AAH Pharmaceuticals placed 11 inhalers on its “out of stock” list on the 30 March 2020.
NHS England wrote to healthcare professionals working in primary care on 31 March 2020, asking them not to overprescribe or over-order during this time, as this will create further pressures on the supply chain.
There are three major randomised controlled trials of medicines to treat COVID-19 being funded by the UK government: PRINCIPLE, RECOVERY and REMAP-CAP (see Feature and trials briefing), and several other trials are being nationally prioritised.
Preliminary results from the RECOVERY trial suggest that low-dose dexamethasone offers significant reductions in mortality for those patients with COVID-19 who require oxygen or ventilation, and it has been approved for use on the NHS.
Results from the REMAP-CAP trial have suggested that tocilizumab and sarilumab reduced the risk of death from COVID-19 by 24% when administered in the first 24 hours of a patient entering intensive care, and these drugs should now be considered by the NHS for hospitalised patients.
Results from the RECOVERY trial also suggest that tocilizumab reduces deaths in patients hospitalised with COVID-19.
An interim analysis of the PRINCIPLE trial suggests the corticosteroid budesonide shortens recovery time from COVID-19 by a median of three days, compared with usual care, in older people treated in the community.
In addition, on 28 April 2020, the Accelerating COVID-19 Research & Development (ACCORD) platform was launched, a collaboration between government, industry and research organisations that aims to reduce the time taken to set up clinical studies for new COVID therapies from months to weeks.
ACCORD will rapidly test potential drugs through early stage clinical trials and, if they show promise, will feed them into the UK’s large-scale COVID-19 studies, such as RECOVERY.
Bemcentinib, an AXL kinase inhibitor, will be the first to begin phase II studies across the UK within the next few days.
Further potential treatments will be rapidly fed into ACCORD as the programme rolls out over the next few weeks.
A Yellow Card website dedicated to reporting side-effects or incidents from medicines being used to treat COVID-19 has been set up by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
The UK has pre-ordered 357 million doses of different potential COVID-19 vaccines from seven manufacturers.
The portfolio includes two adenoviral vector vaccines (Oxford/AstraZeneca and Janssen), two mRNA vaccines (BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna), an inactivated whole virus vaccine (Valneva), and two protein adjuvant vaccines (GSK/Sanofi, Novavax) (see feature).
Three of the vaccines being backed by the UK —BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna and Oxford/AstraZeneca — released positive results from phase III trials in November 2020.
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on 2 December 2020 and the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine was authorised for use by the MHRA on 30 December 2020 and the Moderna vaccine was authorised on 8 January 2021 (see feature).
Hospital pharmacists are overseeing ‘safe handling’ of COVID-19 vaccines in vaccination centres and hospital hubs as part of the mass vaccination programme, which started on 8 December 2020.
NHS England wrote to pharmacy contractors on 27 November 2020, saying that it is planning for designated pharmacy sites to be ready to administer COVID-19 vaccines under a local enhanced service from late December 2020 or early January 2021.
However, “complex logistics” in the vaccine’s supply chain mean NHS England does not expect the majority of contractors’ sites will be able to meet a specific set of requirements, such as administering a minimum of 1,000 vaccines per week, with the fridge space, physical layout and staffing necessary to support that.
Community pharmacy contractors can also collaborate with their local primary care network to support them to deliver maximum vaccine uptake via the GP enhanced service or with vaccination centres, which started vaccinating patients on 14 December 2020.
Vaccination sites led by community pharmacies started administering COVID-19 vaccines to patients on 11 January 2021, with about 200 joining the first wave.
In a letter to contractors dated 16 February 2021, NHS England officials said it would reopen the application process to improve vaccination provision in a list of “priority locations”.
Community pharmacies able to administer up to 400 COVID-19 vaccines per week can now apply to become designated vaccination sites.
CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) AND HIV
Pedestrian crowd crossing crosswalk
FAST FACTS
Current evidence suggest that people living with HIV have a higher risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19.
People living with HIV who are not on treatment or virally suppressed may be at an even greater risk.
Speak to a health care professional for more information on how to stay healthy.
As with the general population, older people living with HIV and those with other underlying health conditions should take extra precautions to prevent illness.
Try to have at least a 30 days’ supply of ART in your home.
If possible, ask for three months.
The current COVID-19 vaccines are considered safe for people living with HIV.
We are continuing to learn about COVID-19.
Remember to keep in touch with your healthcare provider and follow government advice.
This page is updated regularly, make sure you come back for the latest information.
Is COVID-19 worse in people living with HIV?
We are still learning about the risk of COVID-19 in people living with HIV.
Current evidence suggests that people living with HIV are at higher risk of becoming seriously ill, and dying from, COVID-19, than people without HIV.
However, HIV appears to be less of a risk factor than other health conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, severe asthma, respiratory disease, heart disease, liver disease, stroke, dementia, or older age.
The best way to stay healthy is by taking your antiretroviral treatment, as well as any medication you have been prescribed for other health conditions.
We still don’t know whether people living with HIV are more likely to get coronavirus, the virus that causes COVID-19, as more research needs to be done to understand this.
We will continue to update this page as we learn more.
Are some people living with HIV more at-risk of getting ill?
People living with HIV who have a compromised immune system should be extra cautious to prevent coronavirus infection, as they may be at an even higher risk of getting seriously ill.
This includes people with:
a low CD4 count (<350 copies/cell),
a high viral load,
or a recent opportunistic infection, for example, tuberculosis (TB)
a current AIDS-defining illness.
People living with HIV are also more likely to get respiratory infections when their HIV is not well managed.
For this reason it’s very important to take your antiretroviral treatment as prescribed – always, but especially during this time.
Talk to your health care provider if you are currently not taking treatment or if you are struggling with adherence.
Like in people not living with HIV, older people living with HIV and those living with underlying health conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and obesity, should also be vigilant.
I am living with HIV, how can I prevent COVID-19?
The advice for people living with HIV is mostly the same as everyone else.
Stay at least one metre away from people as much as possible, and even greater distance indoors.
Wear a face mask around others.
Avoid places that are crowded, confined or involve close contact with others, especially indoors.
Wash your hands frequently and properly with soap and water, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser.
Avoid touching your face.
Clean and disinfect surfaces regularly.
Cover your nose and mouth with a clean tissue when you sneeze or cough, or use your elbow.
Throw the tissue away and wash your hands afterwards.
Meet people you don’t live with outdoors, as it’s safer to meet outside than inside.
Keep indoor spaces well ventilated, by opening windows and doors, if you do meet people inside.
If you are at-risk of developing severe COVID-19 you should limit physical contact to as few people as possible, ideally just those in your household.
Our main COVID-19 page has lots of information about transmission, prevention and symptoms.
How can people living with HIV prepare for COVID-19?
As well as following the general prevention advice above, people living with HIV can take extra steps to look after their health during this time.
Try to stock-up on your antiretroviral treatment, or any other medication you need to take, so you have enough for at least 30 days, ideally for three months.
Make sure your vaccinations are up-to-date (such as flu and pneumonia vaccines).
Know how to get in touch with your health care facility and peer supporters.
Have a plan for if you need to stay at home, including how to get food and medicine.
Make sure you are eating well and exercising as best you can (even at home).
Look after your mental health and seek support if you need it.
Your clinic or health care provider should let you know if there are any changes or disruptions to services during COVID-19.
If you are having trouble accessing the things you need, including food and medication, call your usual treatment provider.
During this time, some governments are imposing lockdowns to stop the spread of the virus.
This may be particularly difficult for some people.
Keeping in touch with people remotely, such as online, by phone or by video chat, can help you to stay socially connected and mentally healthy.
Infographic showing advice on COVID-19 if you are living with HIV
I am living with HIV, what should I do if I feel unwell?
If you’re feeling unwell – you have a dry cough, a fever, and/or loss or change in sense of smell or taste – stay at home and call your health worker.
They will be able to tell you your next steps.
During this time, make sure you avoid close contact with others.
If you become seriously ill with COVID-19 and are admitted to hospital, you may want to tell the doctor treating you that you have HIV, and to let them know what treatment medication you are taking.
That way, you can continue to take your treatment while you are in hospital.
Are COVID-19 vaccines safe for people living with HIV?
The COVID-19 vaccines currently in use are considered safe for people living with HIV.
To be approved, vaccines must pass multiple safety trials, and be reviewed by national regulators to ensure they are both safe and effective.
Many of the COVID-19 vaccine trials included people living with HIV.
Getting vaccinated will help to protect you from getting sick from COVID-19, so it’s really important to get it when you’re offered.
This is especially important for people living with HIV, who appear to be at a higher risk.
There is nothing to suggest getting a COVID-19 vaccine will affect your antiretroviral treatment in any way.
Can HIV treatment be used against COVID-19?
There is no strong evidence that antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV are effective at treating COVID-19.
If you are already taking ART, you can still get COVID-19 and should take precautions to prevent the virus from spreading and reduce your own risk.
Learn more on our COVID-19 FAQs page.
Remember, COVID-19 is a new illness and we are still learning more about how it behaves.
We urge you to keep an eye on advice from:
the World Health Organization,
your country’s national public health department,
local HIV organisations,
your doctor or healthcare worker.
ABOUT CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19)

FAST FACTS:
COVID-19 is a new infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
The key symptoms of COVID-19 are a fever, dry cough, tiredness and loss of taste or smell.
COVID-19 affects different people in different ways.
Some people do not have any symptoms and may not even know they have the virus, while others get seriously ill and need hospital care.
Physical distancing, wearing a face mask around other people and frequent handwashing are some of the best ways to prevent COVID-19.
COVID-19 vaccines are now being made available in some areas.
These will prevent you from becoming seriously ill from COVID-19.
If you think you have symptoms of COVID-19, stay at home and call your local health authority.
They will tell you what to do next.
What is COVID-19?
COVID-19, otherwise known as coronavirus disease 2019, is a new infectious disease caused by a previously unknown virus called SARS-CoV-2.
The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are:
fever,
dry cough,
tiredness,
loss of taste or smell.
Other symptoms include: nasal congestion, conjunctivitis (red eyes), sore throat, headache, muscle or joint pain, skin rash, nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea, chills or dizziness.
Some people get more seriously ill with COVID-19 and may have symptoms such as shortness of breath, loss of speech or mobility, confusion, chest pain or a high temperature.
These people will need medical care.
In critical cases, COVID-19 can lead to death.
Some people do not have any symptoms and may not even know they have the virus.
You can still pass COVID-19 on even if you aren’t showing any symptoms, so it’s important to always follow the prevention advice.
What are the main symptoms of COVID-19?
Who is most at-risk from COVID-19?
Anyone can get COVID-19 and become seriously ill.
However, people over 60 years old and those with underlying health conditions such as high blood pressure, heart or lung problems, diabetes or cancer are at a higher risk of developing serious illness.
Current evidence suggests people living with HIV have a higher risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19, however, this is lower than for some other health conditions.
The best way to stay healthy is to continue to take your treatment as prescribed and follow the prevention advice for COVID-19.
People living with HIV who have a compromised immune system – those with a low CD4 count, a high viral load or recent opportunistic infection – appear to be at a greater risk.
See our page on COVID-19 and living with HIV.
How is COVID-19 passed on?
COVID-19 is passed on through respiratory droplets.
These are tiny droplets that come from your nose and mouth when you sneeze, cough, breathe, speak or sing.
COVID-19 is normally passed on through close contact with someone who currently has the virus.
When you are in close contact, you are likely to breathe in the respiratory droplets from their mouth and nose, which can contain the virus.
There’s a greater risk of getting COVID-19 in places where people are closer together and spend more time together.
This includes indoor, crowded and poorly ventilated spaces, such as restaurants, gyms, nightclubs, offices and places of worship.
Respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes can also land on surfaces.
The virus is then spread when another person comes into contact with these droplets and touches their own eyes, nose or mouth, without washing their hands first.
What is COVID-19 and how is it passed on?
How can I prevent COVID-19?
The best ways to protect yourself and others from COVID-19 are:
Staying at least one metre away from people as much as possible, and even greater distance when you are indoors.
Wearing a face mask when you are around others.
There are two types of face masks, fabric masks (which you can make yourself and are suitable for most people) and medical masks.
As medical masks are in short supply, they should only be worn by healthcare workers, people with COVID-19 symptoms and those caring for people with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19.
When it’s not possible to maintain a distance of one meter from others, people over 60 and those with underlying health conditions should also wear medical masks.
Both fabric and medical-grade face masks are only effective when used correctly and alongside other prevention measures.
For more information on wearing masks, see our FAQs.
There are several other measures you can take to prevent COVID-19 being passed on.
Wash your hands regularly and properly using soap and water.
You can use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser if you do not have access to water or soap.
Get a COVID-19 vaccine when you are offered it.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
Keep indoor spaces well ventilated when you are inside with other people.
You can do this by opening windows and doors to let fresh air in.
Cover your mouth and nose with a clean tissue when you sneeze or cough.
Throw the tissue away and wash your hands after.
If you don’t have a tissue, cover your face with the inside of your elbow.
Only meet people who are not part of your household outdoors, if local restrictions allow – outdoor gatherings are safer than indoor ones.
How to prevent COVID-19
What should I do if I think I have COVID-19?
You will need to stay at home and self-isolate if you have symptoms of COVID-19 – even if they are mild.
Call your local health authority for advice.
Don’t visit the clinic, as you could pass the virus onto others.
Do not leave your home for any reason during this time, including to go to work or school.
Ask friends or neighbours to bring you any supplies you need.
They should leave these outside and not enter your home.
The people you live with should also stay home for at least 14 days from when you first noticed symptoms to prevent the virus from being passed on.
If you have difficulty breathing, persistent pain in your chest or loss of speech or mobility, or confusion call your health provider immediately.
Most people with COVID-19 recover from the virus without the need for hospital treatment.
What should I do if I have COVID-19 symptoms?
Is there a vaccine for COVID-19?
Several COVID-19 vaccines are being rolled out in some countries.
Follow the official advice in your area to find out when the vaccine will be available to you.
COVID-19 vaccines work by helping our bodies develop immunity to coronavirus, the virus that causes COVID-19.
This means that if you are exposed to the virus, your body will be ready to respond to it and you will be less likely to get seriously ill.
All COVID-19 vaccines currently in use have been proven safe and effective through rigorous clinical trials.
Evidence shows the current vaccines are effective at protecting people from getting sick from COVID-19, however we are still learning about how well they stop the transmission of the virus.
That’s why even after having the vaccine, it’s important to follow prevention measures such as social distancing and wearing a mask.

Transmission and prevention
HIV and COVID-19
The virus is part of a family of coronaviruses which are responsible for lots of different illnesses from the common cold to the flu.
But this new strain can be more severe in some people.
When did COVID-19 start?
The virus was discovered in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since spread around the world.
It was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020.
What are the common symptoms?
The main symptoms of COVID-19 are:
Some people experience other flu-like symptoms, including: nasal congestion, conjunctivitis (red eyes), sore throat, headache, muscle or joint pain, skin rash, nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea, chills or dizziness.
These symptoms can be managed at home.
Not everyone who has COVID-19 will have symptoms.
You can still pass COVID-19 on even if you don’t have symptoms.
That’s why it’s important to follow advice to stop the virus from spreading.
What happens in serious cases of COVID-19?
In some cases, people will become more seriously ill with COVID-19.
Symptoms of severe COVID-19 include shortness of breath, loss of speech or mobility, confusion, chest pain or a high temperature.
If you experience any of these symptoms, it’s important to seek medical care straight away.
When do symptoms start to appear?
The average time for symptoms of COVID-19 to develop is five to six days, but it can take up to 14 days for people to show symptoms.
Are there long-term effects of COVID-19?
Some people have reported experiencing continued symptoms after having COVID-19, such as fatigue, breathing problems and neurological problems.
This includes people with less severe cases of COVID-19, as well as those who have needed hospital care.
Research is currently underway to better understand how many people experience long-term effects of COVID-19, and the nature of these symptoms.
If you think you have COVID-19, stay at home and self-isolate – even if your symptoms are mild.
Call your local health service for advice.
They will tell you what to do, including if you need to take a COVID-19 test and how to do it.
Do not visit your clinic as you could pass the virus onto others.
The people you live with will also need to stay home for at least 14 days from when you first developed symptoms.
Avoid close contact with others in your household while you’re ill.
Stay one metre apart, or in another room if possible.
If you live with someone who’s more vulnerable, try to arrange for them to stay elsewhere.
You can also wear a medical mask to reduce the risk of infection.
Do not leave your home for any reason, including going to work or school while you are self-isolating.
Ask friends or neighbours to bring what you need, and leave it outside.
Do not invite other people to come to your home to help look after you, as you will be putting them at risk of getting the virus.
If you have difficulty breathing and/or persistent pain in your chest, call your local health service immediately.
Most people will recover from COVID-19 by themselves, without the need for hospital treatment.
Do I need to get tested for COVID-19?
If you have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been in close contact with someone who has symptoms or has tested positive, call your health care provider to see if and when you should take a test.
The availability of tests for COVID-19 will vary depending on where you live.
In places where access to testing is limited, priority may be given to people with severe symptoms, health workers and people with a higher risk of getting ill.
While you’re waiting for your results, it’s important that you stay at home and self-isolate.
If your test result is positive, continue to self-isolate and call your health care provider for further advice.
If your result is negative, it does not mean you are immune and you will still need to follow the prevention advice.
If you have tested negative but someone you live with has tested positive, you should continue to isolate.
Does COVID-19 need treatment?
The majority of people who get COVID-19 recover at home, without needing special treatment, usually within about seven days.
Most people will only have mild symptoms similar to the common cold.
Resting, drinking lots of liquids, and taking paracetamol or other home remedies can help with symptoms.
Around 15 in 100 people who get COVID-19 will become severely ill and develop difficulty breathing, in which case they will need hospital care.
A small number of these people will become critically ill and need intensive care.
Who is more vulnerable to COVID-19?
The likelihood becoming severely ill is higher for people over 60 and those with certain underlying health issues, including high blood pressure, heart or lung problems, diabetes, obesity or cancer.
People with a weakened immune system – for example if they are having chemotherapy treatment for cancer, or have a low CD4 count as a result of HIV – are also at a higher risk of serious illness.
Is there a cure for COVID-19?
So far, no drugs are proven to specifically treat COVID-19.
As scientists and doctors continue to learn more about COVID-19, our knowledge of, and ability to treat the virus will improve.
Several COVID-19 vaccines are now being distributed around the world.
Check the official advice where you live to find out when the vaccine will be available to you.
COVID-19 vaccines work by helping your body develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19.
This means your body will be ready to respond faster to the virus if you are exposed to it, so you’ll be less likely to get seriously ill.
Evidence shows the current vaccines can protect people from getting sick from COVID-19.
However, we are still learning more about how effective they are at stopping the virus from being passed on between people.
That’s why it’s important to continue to follow the prevention advice, even after having the vaccine.
COVID-19 is passed on through contact with respiratory droplets (droplets of saliva or mucus from the nose or mouth) from someone who has the virus.
These tiny droplets are spread when an infected person sneezes, coughs, breathes, speaks or sings.
This mainly occurs when people come into close contact with someone who has COVID-19, and the virus gets into their mouth, nose or eyes.
These droplets can also land on nearby surfaces and objects.
The virus is then spread when another person touches the droplets and then touches their own face – particularly eyes, nose or mouth – without washing their hands first.
Is COVID-19 passed on more easily indoors?
There is evidence that COVID-19 is passed on more easily in indoor, crowded and poorly ventilated places where people are closer together for long periods of time.
This includes restaurants, gyms, nightclubs, offices and places of worship.
Can COVID-19 be passed on through sex?
COVID-19 is not a sexually transmitted infection.
However, having sex with someone means getting very close to them, which can spread the virus.
It can also be passed on through saliva when kissing.
Some initial evidence has found COVID-19 can be spread through poop (faeces), so rimming (performing oral sex on your partner’s anus) might increase your risk of getting the virus.
If you or your partner is feeling unwell, it’s best to avoid having any sexual contact – including kissing and cuddling.
Learn more on our sex and COVID-19 page.
Can COVID-19 be passed from mother-to-child?
Emerging evidence suggests that it may be possible for mothers to pass on COVID-19 to their babies through pregnancy or birth, but this is uncommon.
Pregnant women should continue to follow advice to protect themselves from the virus, and seek medical care straight away if they have symptoms.
There is currently no strong evidence that COVID-19 can be passed on through breastfeeding.
However, due to the close contact involved, there is a risk that a mother could pass COVID-19 onto her baby by coughing, sneezing or breathing heavily while breastfeeding.
If you have symptoms of COVID-19, consider wearing a face mask while breastfeeding, washing your hands before and after holding your baby, and regularly disinfecting surfaces you have touched to minimise the risk of passing the virus on.
How can I stop the spread of COVID-19?
The main ways you can stop the virus spreading are:
Keeping a one metre distance from people as much as possible, and even more when you are indoors.
Wearing a face mask when you are around other people.
Other prevention measures include:
avoiding places that are crowded, confined or involve close contact, especially indoors,
washing your hands regularly with soap and water for at least 40 seconds – if you don’t have access to clean water and soap, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer and keep rubbing it into your hands for 20 seconds,
getting a COVID-19 vaccine when you are offered it,
avoiding touching your face,
keeping indoor spaces well ventilated when you are inside with other people,
sneezing or coughing into a clean tissue, and then throw it away and wash your hands - if you don’t have a tissue, use the inside of your elbow to cover your mouth,
only meeting people outdoors, if you are allowed to meet with people from outside your household ,
regularly cleaning and disinfecting surfaces,
staying at home if you feel unwell, and calling your healthcare provider for advice.
When should I wear a face mask?
The World Health Organisation recommends using face masks when you are not able to stay at least one meter away from others.
This includes indoor public places such as shopping centres, religious buildings, restaurants, schools and public transport.
Masks are also recommended in some outdoor places, such as busy markets, crowded streets and bus stops.
You should also wear a mask in rooms with poor ventilation, or if someone visits your home and you cannot keep a one-meter distance.
Depending on where you live in the world, there may be laws requiring you to wear face masks in other situations.
It’s important to know and follow the local guidance.
What type of face mask should I wear?
There are two types of face masks, fabric masks (which you can make yourself or buy) and medical masks (which are in short supply and needed by healthcare workers).
Non-medical fabric face masks
prevent the wearer from passing COVID-19 on to others,
should be made from multiple layers of fabric (see the WHO’s recommended fabric face mask materials),
are for healthy people to wear, because there is evidence that some people infected with COVID-19 have no symptoms but may still be able to transmit the virus,
do not protect you from getting COVID-19, so it’s important that you maintain social distancing and don’t rely on only a fabric mask for protection.
Medical masks
prevent the wearer from getting infected and from passing COVID-19 on
are in short supply globally and should be prioritised for health workers, people with COVID-19 symptoms, people who have tested positive for COVID-19 or are waiting for their test results, and those caring for people with COVID-19 symptoms
should be used by at-risk groups (including those aged over 60 and anyone with pre-existing medical conditions)
Both fabric and medical-grade face masks are only effective when used correctly.
Some general tips include:
clean your hands before and after touching your mask,
make sure your mask fits closely, covering your nose, mouth and chin with no gaps on the sides,
don’t wear a mask that is damaged, dirty or wet,
have your own mask – don’t share it with others,
avoid pulling down your mask when talking to others,
don’t wear your mask on your chin, neck, forehead, around your arm or hanging from your ear.
Masks should be used alongside other prevention measures, such as physical distancing where possible, frequent handwashing and avoiding touching your face or mask.
The World Health Organization has a series of videos and infographics on how to wear different types of masks.
What if I have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19?
If you have come into contact with someone who has symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider to find out if you are able to take a test.
If testing is not available where you live, you will need to self-isolate for 14 days.
Make sure you cooperate with any contract-tracing procedures in your area to control the spread of the virus.
Are people living with HIV more at risk?
Our understanding of the risk of COVID-19 in people living with HIV is evolving.
Current evidence suggests that HIV people living with HIV are at greater risk of becoming seriously ill, and dying, from COVID-19.
However, HIV is less of a risk factor than other health conditions, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer, diabetes, or being over a certain age.
People living with HIV who have a compromised immune system may be at greater risk and should take extra steps to prevent infection.
This includes people with a low CD4 count (<350 copies/cell), a high viral load, a recent opportunistic infection, or a current AIDS-defining illness.
The best way to stay healthy is by taking your antiretroviral treatment.
To find out more, read our coronavirus and HIV page.
People living with HIV should follow the general prevention advice for COVID-19.
It’s also important to:
continue taking your antiretroviral treatment (ART) as prescribed to keep your immune system healthy,
stock up on ART, and any other medication you need to take, so you have at least a 30-day supply, ideally three months if possible,
make sure your immunisations/vaccinations are up to date (such as flu and pneumonia vaccines),
have a plan in place for staying at home, including how you will get hold of food and medicine and how to contact your healthcare facility if necessary,
take care of yourself by eating well, exercising as best you can (even at home), and looking after your mental health.
Coronavirus, COVID-19
Coronaviruses, like the new COVID-19 outbreak that began in China, cause mild to severe respiratory illness including death.
COVID-19 has since spread worldwide.
The best preventive measures include wearing a mask, staying six feet apart, washing hands often, avoiding sick people, keeping your hands away from your face and getting adequate rest and nutrition.

OVERVIEW
Microscopic Rendering of Coronavirus
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a virus (more specifically, a coronavirus) identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China.
What is coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause respiratory illness in humans.
They get their name, “corona,” from the many crown-like spikes on the surface of the virus.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the common cold are examples of coronaviruses that cause illness in humans.
The new strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019.
The virus has since spread to all continents (except Antarctica).
How many people are infected with COVID-19?
The number of people infected changes daily.
Organizations that collect this information, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are gathering information and continuously learning more about this outbreak.
As of this writing (05/11/2021), more than 159,000,000 people in the world have been infected.
Over 3,300,000 people have died.
Some 192 countries and territories on all continents (except Antarctica) have now reported cases of COVID-19.
The U. S.
has the highest number of cases, with more than 32,000,000 people infected and over 580,000 deaths.
India has nearly 23,000,000 cases and 250,000 deaths.
Brazil has more than 15,200,000 cases and 420,000 deaths.
France has over 5,800,000 cases; Turkey has over 5,000,000 cases; Russia and England have over 4,400,000 cases; Italy has more than 4,100,000; Spain and Germany have over 3,500,000 cases; Argentina and Columbia have more than 3,000,000 cases; Poland and Iran have over 2,600,000 cases and Mexico has over 2,300,000 cases.
For the latest statistics, see the World Health Organization's situation reports and Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center map references at end of article.
How does the new coronavirus (COVID-19) spread from person to person?
COVID-19 is likely spread:
When the virus travels in respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, sings or breathes near you (within six feet).
This is thought to be the main way COVID-19 is spread.
When the virus travels in small respiratory droplets that linger in the air for minutes to hours from an infected person who is more than six feet away or has since left the space.
This method of spread is more likely to occur in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation.
From close contact (touching, shaking hands) with an infected person.
By touching surfaces that the virus has landed on, then touching your eyes, mouth, or nose before washing your hands.
Not thought to spread easily by this method.
COVID-19 enters your body through your mouth, nose or eyes (directly from the airborne droplets or from transfer of the virus from your hands to your face).
The virus travels to the back of your nasal passages and mucous membrane in the back of your throat.
It attaches to cells there, begins to multiply and moves into lung tissue.
From there, the virus can spread to other body tissues.
Governments, health agencies, researchers and healthcare providers are all working together to develop policies and procedures to limit the spread of this virus both globally and from individual to individual.
How long is a person infected with COVID-19 considered contagious?
Researchers are still learning about COVID-19.
What IS known is that people infected with COVID-19 can spread the virus to others before experiencing symptoms themselves (while people are still “asymptomatic”).
Once you do have symptoms, the CDC says you are no longer contagious 10 days after your symptoms began.
Until everything about COVID-19 is fully understood, the best advice from healthcare providers to remain safe is to:
Stay six feet away from others whenever possible.
Wear a cloth mask that covers your mouth and nose when around others.
Wash your hands often.
If soap is not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Avoid crowded indoor spaces.
Bring in outdoor air as much as possible.
Stay self-isolated at home if you are feeling ill with symptoms that could be COVID-19 or have a positive test for COVID-19.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.
How soon after becoming infected with COVID-19 will I develop symptoms?
This so-called “incubation period,” the time between becoming infected and showing symptoms, can range from two to 14 days.
The average time before experiencing symptoms is five days.
Symptoms can range in severity from very mild to severe.
In about 80% of patients, COVID-19 causes only mild symptoms.
Who is most at risk for getting COVID-19?
Persons at greatest risk of contracting COVID-19 are:
People who live in or have recently traveled to any area with ongoing active spread.
People who have had close contact with a person who has a laboratory-confirmed or a suspected case of the COVID-19 virus.
Close contact is defined as being within six feet of an infected person for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period.
People over age 60 who have pre-existing medical conditions or a weakened immune system.
Have certain ethnic groups been harder hit by COVID-19?
Yes.
Many researchers have been analyzing data across the country and in some large cities, looking at number of confirmed cases and deaths based on race and ethnicity and related factors.
What they found is that African Americans and the Latino-Hispanic populations have disproportionate higher rates of hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19.
There are several reasons why researchers suspect these populations are more affected.
They believe these ethnic groups tend to:
Live in more crowded housing situations -- living in densely populated areas and in multi-generational households -- making social distancing practices difficult.
Work in consumer-facing service industries and are more likely to use public transportation to get to work, putting them at risk for increased exposure to COVID-19.
Be at increased risk of severe illness if they get COVID-19 because of higher rates of existing medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, asthma, and heart, liver and kidney diseases.
Be more likely to be uninsured or lack a consistent care source, which limits access to COVID-19 testing and treatment services.
Researchers are still studying other factors that may make ethnic groups more susceptible to negative COVID-19 outcomes, including genetics and possible differences in lung tissue as well as socioeconomic status and the social environment and systems.
If I recover from a case of COVID-19, can I be infected again?
Centers for Disease Control says that "the immune response to COVID-19 is not yet understood.
" Because this is a new strain of coronavirus, scientists are still collecting information and research on the virus so it's still too early to know if you can get it a second time if you've had it once.
In a related theme, scientists are seeing a subset of patients who have COVID-19 and have symptoms that continue off and on for weeks and even months.
These patients are called coronavirus long haulers.
Scientists continue to follow these patients.
Where do coronaviruses come from?
Coronaviruses are often found in bats, cats and camels.
The viruses live in but do not infect the animals.
Sometimes these viruses then spread to different animal species.
The viruses may change (mutate) as they transfer to other species.
Eventually, the virus can jump from animal species and begins to infect humans.
In the case of COVID-19, the first people infected in Wuhan, China are thought to have contracted the virus at a food market that sold meat, fish and live animals – but they are still investigating.
Although researchers don’t know exactly how people were infected, they already have evidence that the virus can be spread directly from person to person through close contact.
SYMPTOMS AND CAUSES
What are the symptoms of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection?
The CDC says you may have coronavirus if you have these symptoms or combination of symptoms:
Fever or chills.
Cough.
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.
Tiredness.
Muscle or body aches.
Headaches.
New loss of taste or smell.
Sore throat.
Congestion or runny nose.
Nausea or vomiting.
Diarrhea.
Additional symptoms are possible.
Symptoms may appear between two and 14 days after exposure to the virus.
Children have similar, but usually milder, symptoms than adults.
Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes are at higher risk of more serious complication from COVID-19.
Call 911 and get immediate medical attention if you have these warning signs:
Trouble breathing.
Persistent pain or pressure in your chest.
New confusion.
Inability to arouse (wake up from sleep).
Bluish lips or face.
This list does not include all possible symptoms.
Contact your healthcare provider if you are concerned you may coronavirus, have other symptoms or have any severe symptoms.
DIAGNOSIS AND TESTS
How is coronavirus diagnosed?
COVID-19 is diagnosed with a laboratory test.
Your healthcare provider may collect a sample of your saliva or swab your nose or throat to send for testing.
When should I be tested for the coronavirus (COVID-19)?
Call your healthcare provider if you:
Feel sick with fever, cough or have difficulty breathing.
Have been in close contact with a person known or suspected to have COVID-19.
Your healthcare provider will ask you questions about your symptoms.
Your healthcare provider will tell you if you need to be tested for the novel coronavirus, COVID-19 and where to go to be tested.
If I have a positive test for coronavirus, how long should I self-isolate?
According to current CDC recommendations, you should self-isolate until you've met all three of the following criteria:
It's been 10 days since your symptoms first appeared.
You've not had a fever for 24 hours and you've not used fever-lowing medications during this time.
Your COVID-19 symptoms have improved.
While at home, ideally self-isolate within separate room of your home if possible to limit interaction with other family members.
If you can’t stay 100% isolated in a separate room, stay six feet away from others and wear a cloth mask, wash your hands often/family members wash hands often, and frequently disinfect commonly touched surfaces and shared areas.
You don't need to be retested to be around others outside your home.
However, since everyone and every case is unique, follow your healthcare provider's recommendations for testing.
If you have a weakened immune system or have had a severe case of COVID-19, the CDC's criteria do not apply to you.
You may need to stay home for up to 20 days after your symptoms first appeared.
Talk with your healthcare provider about your situation.
How long do I need to isolate myself if I’ve been around a person with COVID-19?
According to the CDC, if you’ve been in close contact with a person who has COVID-19, your safest strategy is to stay home for 14 days after you’ve last seen this person.
Recently, the CDC updated its guidance.
Alternatives to the 14-day quarantine are:
End your quarantine after 10 days without a test if you've had no symptoms at any time over these 10 days.
End your quarantine after seven days if you've had no symptoms at any time over these seven days and have tested negative for COVID-19.
Your COVID-19 test should be obtained no earlier than day 5 of your quarantine.
If you get a negative test result back before day 7, stay isolated for the full seven days.
If you don't get results back by day 7, continue to quarantine until you do, up to day 10.
Is it possible to test negative for COVID-19 and still be infected with the virus?
This is possible.
There are several reasons for “false negative” test results -- meaning you really DO have COVID-19 although the test result says you don’t.
Reasons for a false negative COVID-19 test result include:
You were tested too early in the course of illness.
The virus hasn’t multiplied in your body to the level that it could be detected by the test.
A good specimen was not obtained.
The healthcare personnel may not have swabbed deeply enough in the nasal cavity to collect a good sample.
There could also be handling errors and transportation errors, as the sample must be transported to a lab to be tested.
The COVID-19 test itself was not sensitive or specific enough to detect COVID-19.
“Sensitivity” refers to the ability of the test to detect the smallest amount of virus.
“Specificity” refers to the ability of the test to detect only the COVID-19 virus and not other similar viruses.
Many different commercial and hospital laboratories have developed tests for COVID-19.
All must meet standards, but no test is 100% sensitive and 100% specific for COVID-19.
This is why there is always a possibility of “false negative” and “false positive” tests.
If you think you might have COVID-19 even if your test is negative, it’s best to follow the current CDC recommendation.
Stay home for 10 days if you think you are sick.
Stay six feet away from others (“social distancing”) and wear a cloth mask.
Contact your healthcare provider if your symptoms worsen.
Contact your healthcare provider when your symptoms improve – don’t decide on your own if it’s safe for you to be around others.
MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT
What medications are currently approved to treat COVID-19?
Currently, only one drug has received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.
Remdesivir (Veklury®) is approved to treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection.
What treatments do people receive if they have COVID-19?
One authoritative organization – The National Institutes of Health COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel – recommends the following treatments based on the severity of COVID-19.
If you’re not in the hospital or don’t need supplemental oxygen:
No specific antiviral or immunotherapy is recommended.
If you’re in the hospital:
You may be given IV remdesivir with or without the oral (by mouth) corticosteroid dexamethasone (or other steroid) or dexamethasone alone if remdesivir can’t be used.
Depending on the severity of your COVID infection, you may need:
Supplemental oxygen (given through tubing inserted into your nostrils).
Mechanical ventilation (receive oxygen through a tube inserted down your trachea).
You are given medications to keep you comfortable and sleepy as long as you’re receiving oxygen through a ventilator.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
You continue to receive treatment while a machine pumps your blood outside your body.
It takes over the function of your body’s lungs and heart.
The National Institutes of Health COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel recommends AGAINST the following treatments:
Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin for the treatment of hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients (except in a clinical trial).
Lopinavir/ritonavir or other HIV protease inhibitors (except in a clinical trial).
Ivermectin (except in a clinical trial).
What other medications have been given FDA emergency use approval for treating COVID-19?
The FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for the investigational monoclonal antibody bamlanivimab for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection in adults and children aged 12 and older who weigh 88 pounds (40 kg) who are not in the hospital.
Patients must be at high risk of worsening to severe status and/or need hospitalization.
The drug is administered through your vein (IV).
EUA status has also been granted for the combination of two monoclonal antibody drugs -- casirivimab and imdevimab -- in adults and children aged 12 and older who weigh 88 pounds (40kg).
The combination is recommended for use in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of worsening to severe status.
The FDA has also granted EUA for convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19.
This is blood donated from people who have a confirmed case of COVID-19 and have recovered.
What vaccines are in use or in late-stage development to prevent COVID-19?
The Food and Drug Administration has granted Emergency Use Authorization for three coronavirus vaccines.
The companies manufacturing the vaccines are Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna/NIH and Johnson & Johnson.
Initial doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were distributed in the United States (and worldwide) beginning in December 2020.
In April of 2021, the CDC and Food and Drug Administration recommended a pause in the use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
Six women in the U. S.
developed blood clots after receiving this company's vaccine.
The agencies want to investigate any possible link between the vaccine and clots and determine if indications of who should receive this vaccine need to be changed.
The 10-day pause was lifted in late April and distribution of the vaccine resumed without restrictions.
The Pfizer vaccine is administered as two doses, 21 days apart and is authorized for use in those age 12 and older.
The Moderna vaccine is administered as two doses, 28 days apart and is authorized for use in those age 18 and older.
Both vaccines have shown similar efficacy levels of near 95%.
Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is a single dose vaccine authorized for use in individuals 18 years of age and older.
Results of a 44,000-person global clinical trial showed the vaccine to be 67% effective against moderate-to-severe COVID-19 at 14 days after being vaccinated and 66% effective at 28 days after vaccination.
Against severe COVID-19, the vaccine was found to be 77% effective at 14 days after vaccination and 85% at 28 days after vaccination.
More than 50 vaccines continued to being studied to prevent COVID-19.
They are now in late-stage (phase three) development and enrolling participants in the United States.
Information on some of these vaccines includes:
AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford are testing their two-dose vaccine in 30,000 trial enrollees.
They are reporting that their vaccine is up to 90% effective.
Novavax has a two-dose vaccine being tested in a trial enrolling 40,000 people.
For more information on the nearly 4,000 clinical trials of medications and vaccines under development anywhere in the world, visit clinicaltrials.gov. 
If I’ve tested positive for COVID-19 and do not need hospitalization, what can I do to best manage my symptoms at home?
If you have mild COVID-19 symptoms, you will likely need to manage your health at home.
Follow these tips:
If you have a fever, drink plenty of fluids (water is best), get lots of rest, take acetaminophen (Tylenol®).
If you have a cough, lie on your side or sit up (don’t lie on your back).
Add a teaspoon of honey to your hot tea or hot water (don’t give honey to children under one year old).
Gargle with salt water.
Call your healthcare provider or pharmacist for advice about over-the-counter, comfort care product, like cough suppressants, cough drops/lozenges.
Have a friend or family member pick up any needed medicines.
You must stay at home.
If you are anxious about your breathing, try to relax.
Take slow deep breaths in through your nose and slowly release through pursed lips (like you’re are slowly blowing out a candle).
If you are having trouble breathing, call 911.
If you have a mild case of COVID-19, you should start to feel better in a few days to a week.
If you think your symptoms are getting worse, call your healthcare provider.
PREVENTION
How can I prevent getting the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)?
Right now, the best defense to prevent getting COVID-19 is to follow some of the same steps you would take to prevent getting other viruses, such as the common cold or the flu.
Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds— especially before eating and preparing food, after using the bathroom, after wiping your nose, and after coming in contact with someone who has a cold.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth to prevent the spread of viruses from your hands.
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when sneezing and coughing or sneeze and cough into your sleeve.
Throw the tissue in the trash.
Wash your hands afterward.
Never cough or sneeze into your hands!
Avoid close contact (within six feet) with those who have coughs, colds or are sick.
Stay home if you are sick.
If you are prone to sickness or have a weakened immune system, stay away from large crowds of people.
Follow the directions of your healthcare authorities especially during outbreaks.
Clean frequently used surfaces (such as doorknobs and counter tops) with a virus-killing disinfectant.
Use hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
Greet people with a friendly gesture instead of shaking hands.
Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet, drink plenty of liquids and exercise if you are able.
These steps will strengthen your immune system and enable you to fight off infections easier.
Should I wear a face mask?
The CDC recommends wearing a cloth face coverings in public, especially in places where it’s hard to maintain at least six feet of distance between yourself and another person.
Face masks protect both you and the people around you.
Cloth face masks are being recommended because we now know individuals with COVID-19 could have mild or no symptoms, while still spreading the virus to others.
The cloth face coverings recommended by the CDC are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators, which should be reserved for healthcare workers and first responders.

A new respiratory virus called the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, or COVID-19 is making headlines for causing an outbreak of respiratory illness throughout the world.
The outbreak began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and quickly spread internationally – including to the United States.
Thousands of people have become sick and public health officials are keeping a close watch on how the virus is spreading.
Intermountain is also watching the situation.
Out of an abundance of caution we’re prepared to support our communities should the situation worsen and we’ll continue to provide updates as new information becomes available.
Here’s what you need to know about coronavirus (COVID-19):
What's different about the coronavirus (COVID-19)?
How are coronaviruses spread?
What are the signs and symptoms of coronaviruses?
How can I protect myself from coronaviruses?
What do I do if I'm sick and think I've been exposed to coronavirus (COVID-19)?
Additional resources about coronavirus (COVID-19) and other coronaviruses?
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are actually common throughout the world and can cause respiratory illness in people and animals.
There are several known coronaviruses that infect people and usually only cause mild respiratory disease, such as the common cold.
However, at least two previously identified coronaviruses have caused severe illness — Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.
What's different about coronavirus (COVID-19)?
While coronaviruses are common, coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new strain of coronavirus that had previously not been identified in humans.
The key features of COVID-19 are respiratory symptoms with a fever and cough.
Like all new infections, understanding COVID-19 is important and changes rapidly.
The CDC is proactively monitoring the virus and taking measures like providing guidance for health care workers and issuing travel recommendations.
An investigation of the COVID-19 is still ongoing but other human coronaviruses are spread through person-to-person contact.
Similar to cold and flu, a person becomes sick through close contact with an infected person.
The virus is spread through respiratory droplets produced by an infected person through coughing and sneezing or by touching surfaces with the virus on them.
In confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections, symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath and the severity has ranged from mild to people being severely ill.
The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas.
Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
In other coronaviruses, common signs of infection include:
runny nose
headache
cough
sore throat
fever
a general feeling of being unwell
The best way to protect yourself from contracting coronaviruses is by using the same daily habits that help prevent the spread of many viruses, including the common cold and the flu.
To help prevent the spread of disease always:
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Wash your hands with soap and water frequently.
Wash with soap and warm water for 20 seconds.
If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Stay home when you’re sick (and keep sick children home from school).
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands.
If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve or elbow, not your hands.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.
If you begin to feel sick with fever, cough, or shortness of breath, please stay home.
Call your primary care provider before going to a healthcare facility and let them know about your symptoms to limit potential exposure to others and avoid spreading the virus.
If you don't meet the CDC and Utah Department of Health criteria for COVID-19 but you're still concerned or have questions, call Intermountain Health Answers at 844-442-5244 to speak with an Intermountain nurse.
Please wear a mask in our facilities and around other people if you have a fever, are coughing, sneezing, have a runny nose, or are having difficulty breathing.
Please also consider using Intermountain's Connect Care service on your smartphone, tablet, or computer to connect with an Intermountain clinician and receive specific care recommendations.
Information about COVID-19 is rapidly changing.

Introduction
As a child care provider, you can help protect children, their families, and staff and slow the spread of COVID-19 by using CDC’s updated Guidance for Operating Child Care Programs during COVID-19.
Tailor your COVID-19 plan based on the unique needs of your child care program and the spread and impact of COVID-19 in your community.
Continue to work with your local public health officials, child care licensing boards/bodies, child care accreditation bodies, health consultants, school districts, and other early childhood partners to monitor the situation and revise your plan as needed.
This CDC guidance is meant to supplement—not replace—any federal, state, tribal, local, or territorial public health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which child care programs must comply.
This guidance is intended for many types of child care programs, including:
Family child care programs, also known as home-based child care
Pre-K (Pre-kindergarten) programs at private and public schools or faith-based institutions
Head Start and Early Head Start programs
Private child care centers
Employer-based child care centers
Emergency or temporary child care centers operated by municipalities for the children of essential service providers, such as first responders, healthcare workers, transit workers, and other industries where a parent cannot stay home
Child care centers that partner with healthcare facilities to support healthcare workers who need child care
Child care programs located in congregate living programs such as homeless shelters or residential programs for women and children
School age child care programs

Children and COVID-19
While fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared with adults during the pandemic, children can be infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, can get sick with COVID-19, and can spread the virus to others.
1,2,3,4) Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, and some have no symptoms at all.
5) The symptoms of COVID-19 in children are similar to symptoms of other common illnesses, like colds, strep throat, influenza, or allergies.
Like adults, children who have COVID-19 but have no symptoms can still spread the virus to others.
6) For more information, visit COVID-19 in Children.
Children with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
Although the number of children who have been hospitalized with COVID-19 is low compared with adults, one third of hospitalized children with COVID-19 are admitted to the intensive care unit.
6) Additionally, a small number of children might develop a rare but serious condition associated with COVID-19 called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C).
Although the risk for death among children is low compared with adults, some children in the United States have died from COVID-19.
Reports have shown that children in child care settings can become infected and spread COVID-19 to others in the child care program, at home, and in the community.
8,9) Some staff and household family members might be at increased risk of severe illness.
For example, people who are older and have underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
For information about who is at increased risk, visit People at Increased Risk.
However, child care programs support children’s social-emotional, behavioral, and mental health while fostering early learning development.
Child care programs can also help serve children in need through nutrition programs, special education services, and after-school programs.
In addition, child care programs support parents with reliable and safe care so they can return to work.
The benefits of keeping child care programs open should be weighed against the risks posed by COVID-19 spread in the child care program and community.
Additional information has shown that a comprehensive, multipronged approach for COVID-19 prevention strategies might help slow transmission in the early care and education setting.
10) Child care programs should make decisions about reopening and continuing operations based on available data including levels of community COVID-19 transmission (spread) and the child care program’s ability to implement appropriate prevention strategies (risk reducing actions) to stay open safely and protect children, staff, and administrators.
Taking Actions to Lower the Risk of COVID-19 Spread
COVID-19 is mostly spread through close contact and inhalation of respiratory droplets released when people talk, sing, breathe, sneeze, or cough.
Although less likely, it is possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own eyes, nose, or mouth.
To slow the spread of COVID-19 in your community and facility, your child care program should fully implement and adhere to multiple prevention strategies.
Prevention strategies are the actions put in place by the child care program and taken by people to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 (for example, staying home when sick, wearing a mask that covers the nose and mouth, physical distancing, avoiding crowds, avoiding poorly ventilated indoor spaces, frequent handwashing, cohorting, and regular and consistent cleaning and disinfecting, which are described in detail later in this document).
Consistent and correct use of these strategies can lower the risk of transmission in your child care program.
Keep in mind that community spread plays a part in overall risk to your program.
So, it is important to stay updated on your community’s COVID-19 status through your local health departmentexternal icon as you regularly assess your program’s prevention strategies.
COVID-19 Vaccination
Vaccines are an important tool to help stop the COVID-19 pandemic.
Early care and education providers hold jobs critical to the continued functioning of society and are at potential occupational risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
As frontline essential workers, child care providers have been prioritized nationally to receive vaccination.
CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization practices (ACIP) recommends that frontline essential workers, including child care providers, be prioritized for vaccine allocation in phase 1b.
To address this important public health issue, the Health and Human Services Secretary issued a Secretarial Directiveexternal icon on March 2, 2021, that directs all COVID-19 vaccination providers administering vaccine purchased by the U. S.
government to make vaccines available to those who work in pre-K-12 schools, as well as Head Start and Early Head Start programs.
Those who work as or for licensed child care providers are also eligible.
This means that in addition to existing state and local COVID-19 vaccination sites, teachers and staff in schools and child care programs across the nation can sign up for an appointment at over 9,000 pharmacy locations participating in the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination.
Getting vaccinated as soon as the opportunity is available is an important way for you and your staff to stay safe and reduce the risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19.
Review CDC’s COVID-19 Vaccination Information or talk to your healthcare provider for more information.
New CDC resources are available to provide information about this directive:
The COVID-19 Vaccines for Teachers, School Staff, and Childcare Workers webpage provides school and childcare staff with the latest information about where and how to book an appointment.
The COVID-19 Vaccine Toolkit for School Settings and Childcare Programs provides schools and childcare programs with ready-made materials they can use to communicate with staff about COVID-19 vaccination.
Even after child care providers and staff are vaccinated, there will be a need to continue prevention measures for the foreseeable future including wearing masks, physical distancing, and other important prevention strategies outlined in this guidance document.
Plan and Prepare
Two of the most important steps to take before reopening and for continuing operations are planning and preparing.
To best plan and prepare, you should expect that children, staff, and family members might become sick with COVID-19, and your child care program must know what to do when this happens.
An important step is to review, update, and implement emergency operations plans (EOPs) – also known as Emergency or Disaster Preparedness Plans.
Your child care program should have a plan in place to protect staff, children, and their families from the spread of COVID-19.
Your COVID-19 plan should include steps you will take when a child or staff member has been exposed to someone with COVID-19, has symptoms of COVID-19 or tests positive for COVID-19.
You should develop your plan based on state licensing regulations and in collaboration with regulatory agencies, state and local public health departments, and child care health consultants or other organizations that support your child care program.
See key resources on emergency preparedness (for example, Caring for our Childrenexternal icon National Health and Safety Performance Standards Guidelines for Early Care and Education Programs and the Emergency Preparedness Manualexternal icon for Early Childhood Programs) while reviewing, updating, and implementing your EOP.
Involve staff, parents/guardians, and other community partners (for example, youth service organizations and health centers) in the development of your EOP.
As you develop your EOP, CDC recommends that you:
Keep track of the spread of COVID-19 in your area.
This information can often be found on the local health department website or on CDC’s COVID Data Tracker County View.
This can help you make decisions about changes to your prevention strategies, and if closing your child care program may be necessary.
Develop communication systems between your child care program and parents, guardians, and caregivers.
This could be through a combination of phone, email or texting protocols, and/or periodic virtual meetings with parents, guardians, caregivers, and child care providers.
Use these systems to help track absenteeism in children or staff or to respond to an outbreak at the facility.
Adopt measures to promote preventive behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19 and share information on these risk reducing measures with parents, guardians, and caregivers.
Consider needs of children with disabilities, children with healthcare needs, children experiencing homelessness, migrant children, and other needs of your families and children.
For a specific child with disabilities or health concerns, work directly with the child, the child’s family, and the child’s providers (health care or special education) to determine how to best serve their needs.
Connect with key partners that can link families experiencing homelessness to community resources.
Provide information and resources to staff and families about how to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
Ensure that the resources selected are culturally relevant, in plain language, and available in appropriate languages and accessible formats for the families your child care program serves.
In collaboration with local officials, decide on clear criteria for when your child care program will suspend in-person operations to stop or slow the spread of COVID-19, as well as clear criteria for when to resume operations.
Assess the services your child care program provides to meet the basic needs of children and families (such as meals and snacks through the USDA nutrition programsexternal icon and other provided services) and develop measures to address these needs if operations are suspended or if a child needs to isolate or quarantine as a result of a diagnosis of or exposure to COVID-19.
Learn about Guidance for Operating Youth and Summer Camps
Promoting Behaviors that Reduce Spread of COVID-19
The actions put in place by your child care program and taken by the staff and families will help reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19.
Using many of the following prevention strategies at the same time can lower the risk of transmission of COVID-19 in your child care program.
Staying Home when Appropriate
Educate your staff and families about when they/their child(ren) should not come to the child care program:
Staff and children should stay home if they are sick or have recently had close contact (within 6 feet for a cumulative total of fifteen minutes or more over a 24-hour period) with a person with COVID-19.
Staff and children should stay home if they have tested positive for or are showing symptoms of COVID-19.
Develop policies that encourage sick employees to stay at home without fear of negative consequences.
Ensure policies are clearly communicated to your staff.
CDC’s criteria can also help inform when your children and staff can return:
If they have been sick with COVID-19
If they have recently had close contact with a person with COVID-19
Child care programs may also consider consulting CDC’s webpage on Workplaces and Business, which provides guidance and strategies to prevent and reduce transmission and maintain healthy business operations and work environments.
Respiratory Etiquette and Hand Hygiene
Help children learn simple steps to keep from getting and spreading COVID-19.
Use visual tools, demonstrations, stories, and play:
Encourage staff and children to cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue.
Used tissues should be thrown in the trash and hands washed immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer.
Teach and reinforce handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and increase monitoring to ensure adherence among all children and staff.
Make sure hands are thoroughly dry after washing using either a clean, dry towel or air drying.
If soap and water are not readily available, staff and children (over age 2) can use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Make sure all surfaces of hands are covered and that hands are rubbed together until they feel dry.
Hand sanitizers should be stored up, away, and out of sight of children and should be used only with adult supervision for children under age 6 years.
Hand sanitizers might not be as effective when hands are visibly dirty or greasy, handwashing with soap and water for 20 seconds is recommended.
Assist children with handwashing, including infants who cannot wash hands alone.
After assisting children with handwashing or helping them put on or adjust their mask, staff should also wash their hands.
All children and staff should wash their hands with soap and water at the following key times:
Arrival to your facility
Before and after preparing food or drinks
Before and after eating or handling food or feeding children
Before and after helping a child put on or adjust their mask
Before and after administering medication or medical ointment
Before and after diapering a child
After using the bathroom or after helping a child use the bathroom
After having contact with body fluids
After handling garbage
Holding, Washing, or Feeding a Child
It is important that you comfort crying, sad, or anxious infants and toddlers and they often need to be held.
To the extent possible when holding, washing, or feeding young children, protect yourself by:
Washing your hands frequently.
Wash your hands, neck, and anywhere you have been touched by a child’s body fluids.
Avoid touching your eyes while holding, washing, or feeding a child.
If body fluids get on the child’s clothes, change them right away, whenever possible, and then your hands should be rewashed.
Wash your hands before and after handling infant bottles prepared at home or in the facility.
Wearing Masks
Everyone 2 years and older should wear a mask covering their mouth and nose when around people who do not live in their household, except when eating or sleeping.
Teach and reinforce the consistent and correct use of masks for all staff and children aged 2 years and older.
A mask is NOT a substitute for physical distancing.
Masks should still be worn in addition to physical distancing.
Wearing a mask is especially important indoors and when physical distancing is difficult to implement or maintain while providing care to young children.
Learn from CDC about How to Select, Wear, and Clean Your Mask.
After touching or removing your mask, wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
CDC recognizes there are specific instances when wearing a mask is not be feasible.
In these instances, consider adaptions and alternatives.
Face Shields and Goggles
CDC does not recommend using face shields or goggles as a substitute for masks.
Do NOT put a plastic face shield (or a mask) on newborns or infants.
For more information, visit Considerations for Wearing Masks.
How to Store and Wash Masks
Store cloth masks properly and wash them regularly to keep them clean.
Have more than one mask on hand so that you can easily replace a dirty mask with a clean one.
Make sure to remove your mask correctly and wash your hands after touching a used mask.
When reusing your mask after a break, keep the same side facing out.
For more information on washing masks, visit How to Wash Masks.
Signs and Messages
Post signs in visible locations (entrances and restrooms) that promote everyday protective measures and describe how to stop the spread of germs (such as by properly washing hands and properly wearing a mask).
Signs should be clear, be easy-to-understand, use pictures, be at appropriate reading and literacy level, and be in primary languages spoken by your staff and families.
Use various communication methods to ensure accessibility for all, including those with disabilities and vision impairments.
Find freely available CDC print and digital resources on CDC’s communication resources main page.
CDC also has videos including one with American Sign Language related to COVID-19 and other communication tools.
CDC has also created several resources and infographics for child care providers available at CDC’s toolkit for child care programs.
Maintaining Healthy Environments
Consider using the following recommended changes to physical spaces to maintain a healthy child care environment.
Cleaning
Develop a schedule for increased frequency of routine cleaning of high-touch surfaces.
An example can be found hereexternal icon
Ensure safe and correct useexternal icon and storage of your cleaning and disinfection products, including storing products securely away from children.
If surfaces are dirty, clean them using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
Use products on List N: Disinfectants for Coronavirus (COVID-19)external icon and follow instructions for how long a product must be in contact with a surface to be effective.
If possible, provide EPA-registered disposable wipes to staff so that commonly used surfaces such as keyboards, desks, and remote controls can be wiped down before use.
If wipes are not available, please refer to CDC’s guidance on cleaning and disinfecting your facility.
Cleaning and disinfection products should not be used by children or placed near children.
Staff should ensure that there is adequate ventilation when using these products to prevent children or themselves from inhaling toxic vapors.
Special considerations should be made for people with asthma.
Some cleaning and disinfection products can trigger asthma.
Learn more about reducing your chance of an asthma attack while disinfecting to prevent COVID-19.
Ensure adequate supplies.
Ensure you have adequate supplies to support hand hygiene behaviors and routine cleaning of objects and surfaces.
This includes soap and water, hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol (for your staff and children who can safely use hand sanitizer), paper towels, tissues, disinfectant wipes, masks (as feasible), and no-touch/foot-pedal trash cans (if available).
If you have difficulty obtaining these supplies, please consider contacting your state child care office to see if additional resources are available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
external icon Additionally, you may contact your local Child Care Resource and Referral (CCR&R) Agency to learn more about service organizations in your community that may have additional resources.
Your local CCR&R Agencyexternal icon can be found at Child Care Aware of Americaexternal icon.
Clean surfaces.
Reducing the Spread of Germs at Schools
Cleaning and promoting hand hygiene are important everyday actions schools can take to slow the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases and protect students and staff.
Cleaning with products containing soap or detergent reduces germs on surfaces and objects by removing contaminants and may also weaken or damage some of the virus particles, which decreases risk of infection from surfaces.
Cleaning high touch surfaces and shared objects once a day is usually enough to sufficiently remove virus that may be on surfaces unless someone with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 has been in your school.
For more information on cleaning and disinfecting schools, see Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Facility.
Disinfecting (using disinfectants on U. S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s List Nexternal iconexternal icon) removes any remaining germs on surfaces, which further reduces any risk of spreading infection.
Clean more frequently or clean AND disinfect surfaces and objects if certain conditions apply
High transmission of COVID-19 in your community
Low number of people wearing masks or improper mask usage
Infrequent hand hygiene
The space is occupied by people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19
When Someone is Sick
If someone in your school is sick or someone who has COVID-19 has been in your school in the last 24 hours, clean and disinfect your facility.
For more information on cleaning and disinfecting safely, see Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Facility.
Use Disinfectants Safely
Always read and follow the directions on how to use and store cleaning and disinfecting products.
Disinfection products should not be used by children or near children.
Ventilate the space when using these products to prevent children from inhaling toxic vapor.
Consider ventilation system upgrades or improvements and other steps to increase the delivery of clean air and dilute potential contaminants in the building.
Learn More.
Always follow standard practices and appropriate regulations specific to your school for minimum standards for cleaning and disinfection.
For more information on cleaning various surfaces and other cleaning guidelines, see Cleaning and Disinfecting Your Facility.
Clean and sanitize toys.
Caring for Our Childrenexternal icon provides national standards for cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfection of educational facilities for children.
Toys that can be put in the mouth should be sanitized between uses or not used if they cannot be cleaned and sanitized.
Set aside toys that children have placed in their mouths or that are otherwise contaminated through contact or other body fluids until they can be cleaned by hand by a person wearing gloves.
Clean with water and detergent, rinse, and sanitize with an EPA-registered disinfectant, rinse again, and air-dry.
You can also clean in a mechanical dishwasher.
Be mindful of items more likely to be placed in a child’s mouth, like play food, dishes, and utensils.
Machine washable cloth toys should be used by one person at a time or should not be used at all.
These toys should be laundered before being used by another child.
Do not share toys with other groups of infants or toddlers, unless they are washed and sanitized before being moved from one group to the other.
Set aside toys that need to be cleaned.
Place in a dish pan with soapy water or put in a separate container marked for “soiled toys. Keep dish pan and water out of reach from children to prevent risk of drowning.
Washing with soapy water is the ideal method for cleaning.
Try to have enough toys so that the toys can be rotated through cleanings.
Children’s paperback books, like other paper-based materials such as mail or envelopes, are not considered a high risk for transmission and do not need additional procedures for cleaning or disinfection.
Diapering a child.
When diaperingexternal icon a child, wash your hands and wash the child’s hands before you begin, and wear gloves.
Follow safe diaper changing procedures.
Where feasible, diapering should not be done by the same person who prepares food.
If you are the only person available for both diapering and food preparation, use additional prevention strategies (such as handwashing) between diapering and food preparation.
After diapering, take off gloves and wash your hands (even if you were wearing gloves) and disinfect the diapering area with a fragrance-free disinfectant that is EPA List N: Disinfectants for Coronavirus (COVID-19)external icon as a sanitizing or disinfecting solution.
If other products are used for sanitizing or disinfecting, they should also be fragrance-free and EPA-registered.
If the surface is dirty, it should be cleaned with detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
If reusable cloth diapers are used, do not rinse or clean them in your facility.
Place the soiled cloth diaper and its contents (without emptying or rinsing) in a plastic bag or into a plastic-lined, hands-free covered diaper pail to give to parents/guardians or laundry service.
Download posters with diaper changing procedures.
Transport vehicles.
If transport vehicles (for example, buses or vans) are used by your child care program, drivers should practice all safety actions and protocols as indicated for other staff (for example, hand hygiene, masks).
To clean and disinfect buses or other transport vehicles, see guidance for bus transit operators.
Create distance between children on transport buses (for example, seat children one child per row, skip rows) when possible.
However, children from the same home can be seated together.
Ventilation
Consider how you can bring in as much fresh air into your child care center or family child care home as possible.
Bringing fresh, outdoor air into your center or home helps keep virus particles from concentrating inside.
Increase outdoor air ventilation, using caution in highly polluted areas.
See CDC’s webpage to get more information about local air quality.
If it’s safe to do so, open doors and windows as much as you can to bring in fresh, outdoor air.
While it’s better to open them wide, even having a window cracked open slightly can help.
If you can, open multiple windows and doors to allow more fresh air to move inside.
Do not open windows and doors if doing so is unsafe for you or others (for example, risk of falling, triggering asthma symptoms, high levels of pollution).
If opening windows or doors is unsafe, consider other approaches for reducing the amount of virus particles in the air, such as using air filtration and exhaust fans.
Consider running your HVAC system at maximum outside airflow for 2 hours before and after the center or home is occupied.
Ventilation considerations are also important on your transport vehicles such as buses or vans.
Open windows to increase airflow from outside when safe to do so.
Ensure restroom exhaust fans are functional and operating at full capacity when the center or home is occupied.
Clean and change filters as recommended by manufacturer.
Inspect and maintain your local exhaust ventilation in areas such as restrooms, kitchens, cooking areas, etc.
Use child safe fans to increase the effectiveness of open windows.
Placing a fan by an open window to blow inside air out is a good way to encourage air flow throughout the room.
Even without an open window, fans can improve air flow and keep virus particles from staying concentrated in one place.
Ensure your ventilation systems operate properly and provide acceptable indoor air quality for the current occupancy level for each space.
Additional information for child care centers and family child care homes can be found on Ventilation in Schools and Child Care Programs page.
This page has a more in-depth list of ventilation interventions that can help reduce the concentration of virus particles, such as SARS-CoV-2, in the air.
The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) also has Guidance for Building Operations During the COVID-19 Pandemicexternal icon.
Review additional ASHRAE guidelines for schools and universitiesexternal icon for further information on ventilation recommendations for different types of buildings and building readiness for occupancy.
If your child care center or family child care home does not have an HVAC system or wants extra filtration, consider using a portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) cleaner.
HEPA cleaners trap particles that people exhale when breathing, talking, singing, coughing, and sneezing.
When choosing a HEPA cleaner, select one that is the right size for the room(s).
One way to do this is to select a HEPA fan system with a Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) that meets or exceeds the square footage of the room in which it will be used.
See EPA’s Guide to Air Cleaners in the Home for more information.
Water Systems
bottle refill station
restroom sinks with running water
Before students and staff return to a school or childcare building that has been closed for an extended time, look for ways to reduce potential hazards.
Flush plumbing (including all sink faucets, water fountains, water bottle fillers, hoses, and showers) to replace all water inside building pipes with fresh water.
This can help protect occupants from possible exposure to lead, copper, and Legionella bacteria.
You can also follow the U. S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 3Ts – Training, Testing, and Taking Actionexternal icon – for reducing lead in drinking water at schools and childcare centers.
Follow guidance to check your building for mold and remediate as needed.
Drinking fountains should be cleaned and sanitized.
Encourage staff and families to bring their own water to minimize use and touching of water fountains or consider installing no-touch activation methods for water fountains.
Modified Layouts
Physically distance child seating areas when possible.
Turn your tables to face in the same direction (rather than facing each other), or have your children sit on only one side of your tables, spaced apart, particularly at mealtimes.
Modify your learning stations and activities to keep children physically distanced, when possible.
Physical Barriers and Guides
Provide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls, to ensure that staff and children maintain 6 feet physical distance from other “classrooms” or cohorts in common areas (for example, guides for creating “one-way routes” in hallways).
Recognizing that for very young children, lining up physically distanced may be developmentally difficult and may need to be modified.
Install physical barriers, such as sneeze guards and partitions, particularly in settings where it is difficult for people to remain physically distanced (for example, child care center reception desks and entryways).
Ensure barriers are regularly cleaned and disinfected.
Family child care providers can use physical barriers and guides where it is difficult to remain physically distanced.
Communal Spaces
The use and number of communal spaces may vary by child care program type.
If your child care program does have communal spaces that are used by multiple different groups of children throughout the day such as dining halls, multi-purpose rooms, and playgrounds, stagger their use and properly clean and disinfect between groups.
Ensure proper hand hygiene is practiced by children and staff before and after each use.
Closing communal spaces may be considered if you are unable to maintain routine cleaning.
For more information, see cleaning and disinfecting facilities page.
It is important that adults consistently and correctly wear masks and maintain a distance of 6 feet from each other, especially for longer interactions.
Child care programs interested in outdoor learning may benefit from reviewing CDC’s COVID-19 guidance on Considerations for Outdoor Learning Gardens and Community Gardens.
Playgrounds and Outdoor Play Spaces
Outdoor spaces reduce risk of spreading COVID-19, but still require preventive behaviors (staying home when sick, physical distancing, avoiding crowds, wearing a mask, handwashing, cohorting, and cleaning and disinfection).
Communal outdoor spaces, such as playgrounds (play structures, jungle gyms, swing sets) and play spaces with shared toys or equipment (for example balls, tricycles, toy cars) are important for healthy child development, but can pose a risk for spreading COVID-19.
Even though outdoor spaces reduce risk of spreading COVID-19, the virus can still spread when young children touch contaminated objects, and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Preventive behaviors such as wearing a mask, handwashing, and cohorting are needed.
Keep readily available your supplies, such as hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, disinfectant wipes, paper towels, tissues, and no-touch trash cans in outdoor areas for staff and children.
Based on existing prevention strategies implemented and the needs of your children and families, it is important that you carefully consider the use of your playground, play spaces, toys, and equipment.
Consult with public health officials and refer to state and local regulations on playgrounds.
Outdoor areas generally require normal routine cleaning and do not require disinfection.
Do not spray disinfectant on sidewalks and in outdoor play areas as it is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19.
You should continue existing cleaning and hygiene practices for outdoor areas.
The targeted use of disinfectants can be done effectively, efficiently, and safely on outdoor hard surfaces and objects frequently touched by multiple children and staff (for example, handrails, benches); make sure disinfectant has thoroughly dried before allowing children to play.
Routinely clean high touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings.
Do not clean and disinfect wooden surfaces (play structures, benches, tables) or groundcovers (mulch, sand).
Consider restricting your use of play structures or equipment that position children close by one another (for example facing each other on a tire swing, crawling close together in tunnels, or enclosed with one another in fort-type structures.
Stagger your use of playgrounds and play spaces by reducing the group size in the play area at one time or remaining in cohorted groups while sanitizing shared objects and high touch surfaces between groups.
If multiple cohort groups need to be in your play area at the same time, consider using fencing or another barrier to designate separate areas for each cohort.
Reinforce Prevention Strategies in Indoor Shared Spaces
The number and use of shared spaces may vary by child care program type.
Before entering any shared space, require children to wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
During use of a shared space, combine multiple prevention strategies, such as use of masks, physical distancing, hand hygiene, and cleaning and disinfection of shared objects and high touch surfaces.
Masks should be used in both indoor and outdoor spaces by child care program staff and children over the age of 2.
However, masks should not be placed on:
Children younger than 2 years old
Anyone who has trouble breathing
Anyone who is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance
As feasible, clean and disinfect your shared objects and surfaces more frequently.
For example, clean community-use objects such as popular play toys at scheduled times, or if someone sneezes or coughs, between uses.
Require hand washing or use of hand sanitizer after coughing or sneezing.
Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and dry hands thoroughly with a clean towel or air dryer.
If hands are not visibly dirty, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol can be used if soap and water are not readily available.
Supervise children when they use hand sanitizer to prevent sanitizer ingestion or contact with eyes.
After use of a shared space, require all children to wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
Food Service
While there is currently no evidence that ingesting food is associated with spreading COVID-19, it is possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object, including food or food packaging, that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.
However, this is not the main way the virus spreads.
Use a mask or require staff to wear a mask and continue using prevention strategies like physical distancing, hand hygiene, and proper ventilation when preparing and serving meals.
As feasible, have children and staff eat meals outdoors or in well ventilated classrooms or spaces within the family child care home while maintaining distance as much as possible.
Masks should be stored in a space designated for each child that is separate from others when not being worn (for example, in individually labeled containers, bags, or cubbies) and put back on when not eating.
If cafeterias or communal dining halls will be used, ensure separate “classrooms” or cohorts remain 6 feet apart while eating and faced in the same direction.
Consider staggering when classrooms eat, so children can maintain their small groups.
Clean and disinfect tables, chairs, and highchairs between each use.
Surfaces that come in contact with food should be washed, rinsed, and sanitized (using EPA List N: Disinfectants for Coronavirus (COVID-19)external icon) before and after meals.
Ensure that children and staff wash their hands with soap and water for 20 seconds or use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol before and after handling, preparing, serving or eating food.
If feasible, remove or limit additional staff coming into classrooms during mealtimes.
All staff should wear a mask covering their mouth and nose and wash their hands for 20 seconds with soap and water before entering the room where meals are being served.
Staff should always wear gloves when preparing food.
Where feasible, food preparation should not be done by the same person who diapers children.
If you are the only person available for both diapering and food preparation, consider meal preparations that can be done ahead of time or choose food with minimal preparation.
Avoid offering any self-serve food or drink options.
Instead, serve individually plated or pre-packaged meals and snacks while ensuring the safety of children with food allergies.
If your meals are typically served family-style, identify one employee to place food on plates so that multiple staff and children are not handling serving utensils.
Use disposable food service items (for example, utensils, trays).
If using disposable items is not feasible or desirable, ensure that all non-disposable food service items and equipment are handled by staff with gloves and washed, rinsed, and sanitized to meet food safety requirements.
Everyone should wash their hands after removing their gloves or after directly handling used food service items.
Avoid holding any in-person events that includes family members or other adults who do not work in the child care program.
Avoid using cloth table coverings or other hard to clean table covers.
Avoid group type activities for taste testing, cooking demonstrations, and other food sampling.
Utilize no-touch or foot pedal trash cans, if available.
Of note: USDA has issued the COVID-19 Nationwide Waiver to Allow Meal Pattern Flexibilityexternal icon in the Child Nutrition Programs, such as the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP).
Maintaining Healthy Operations
Multiple strategies can be used by your child care program and staff to maintain healthy child care program operations.
Protections for Staff at Higher Risk for Severe Illness from COVID-19
Offer modified job responsibilities for your staff at higher risk for severe illness (including older adults and people of all ages with certain underlying medical conditions or disabilities) that limit their exposure risk.
Encourage staff to talk to their healthcare providers to assess their risk and to determine if they should stay home, and to get a vaccineexternal icon when it is offered.
Consistent with applicable laws, put in place policies to protect the privacy of people at higher risk for severe illness regarding underlying medical conditions.
Children with Disabilities or Special Needs
Provide accommodations, modifications, and assistance for children with disabilities and special needs:
Your child care program should remain accessible for children with disabilities.
Physical distancing can be difficult for young children with disabilities.
Wearing masks may be difficult for young children with certain disabilities (for example, visual or hearing impairments) or for those with sensory, cognitive, or behavioral issues.
For children who are only able to wear masks some of the time for these reasons, prioritize having them wear masks during times when it is difficult to separate children and/or staff (for example, during carpool drop off or pick up, or when standing in line).
If interacting with people who rely on reading lips, consider wearing a clear mask or a cloth mask with a clear panel.
Many children require assistance or visual and verbal reminders to cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when they cough or sneeze, throw tissues in the trash, and wash their hands.
Where service or therapy animals are used, use guidance to protect the animal from chemical disinfectants and from COVID-19 (even though the number of dogs and other pets who have contracted COVID-19 from humans remains low).
Cleaning and disinfecting procedures might negatively affect children with sensory or respiratory issues.
Avoid overuse, use safer productsexternal icon, and clean and disinfect when these children are not nearby, if possible.
Behavioral techniques (such as modeling and reinforcing desired behaviors and using picture schedules, timers, and visual cues for positive reinforcement) can help all children adjust to changes in routines and take preventive actions but may be especially beneficial for some children with disabilities.
If outside program services are necessary in the facility, see guidance below for Direct Service Providers.
Organizations that support people with disabilities have information and resources to help child care programs with these behavioral techniques.
In addition, behavioral therapists or local mental health or behavioral health agencies may be able to provide consultation for specific concerns.
Guidance for Direct Service Providers (DSPs)
Direct Service Providers (DSPs) include direct support professionals, paraprofessionals, therapists, early intervention specialists, and others.
DSPs should be allowed into your facility to provide important services to children, and there are several steps you can take to make sure they do so as safely as possible.
Ask DSPs before they enter your facility if they are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 or if they have been in contact with someone who might have COVID-19.
If DSPs provide services in other programs or facilities, ask specifically whether any of the other places have had positive COVID-19 cases.
For guidance related to screening of staff (including DSPs), please refer to CDC’s Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers Responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the Prevent Transmission Among Employees section of CDC’s Resuming Business Toolkit pdf icon[1.
15 MB, 22 pages].
If space allows, limit the interaction of the DSP to only the child(ren) they need to see and utilize mask wearing and physical distancing as much as feasible.
When developing cohorts, it is important to consider services for children with disabilities, so that they may receive services within the cohort if feasible.
CDC has developed guidance for DSPs.
Child care providers should review the DSP guidance and ensure that DSPs that need to enter your child care program facility are aware of those preventive actions, which include:
DSPs should wash their hands with soap and water when entering and leaving any child care program, when adjusting or putting on or off facemasks, and before putting on and after taking off disposable gloves.
If soap and water are not readily available, they should use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
DSPs should launder work uniforms or clothes after each use with the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely.
When working with or having direct physical contact with young children, DSPs can consider protecting themselves by wearing an oversized, button-down, long sleeved shirt and changing it when traveling between child care programs.
Child care programs can work with families and healthcare providers in the community to help keep children and families healthy during the pandemic.
Children should continue regular well-child visits for routine immunizations and preventive screenings, such as screening for autism and lead poisoning, during the pandemic.
Adults and children should get a flu vaccine before or during the influenza season (fall–winter; usually November–March).
Children younger than 5 years old – especially those younger than 2 – are at higher risk than some other populations of developing serious flu-related complications.
Currently, COVID-19 vaccines are not yet approved for use in children under 16 years old.
However, CDC recommends an annual flu vaccine for everyone 6 months and older.
Child care programs can also share information with families on child development and positive parenting.
Identifying Small Groups and Keeping Them Together (Cohorting)
Place children and child care providers into distinct groups that stay together throughout an entire day.
If possible, your child care groups should include the same children each day, and the same child care providers should remain with the same group of children each day.
Limit mixing between groups such that there is minimal or no interaction between groups or cohorts.
The number of cohorts or groups may vary depending on child care program type (centers versus homes) and size, with smaller programs having fewer cohorts than larger ones.
Consider whether to alter or halt daily group activities that might increase risk of COVID-19 transmission.
Keep each group of children in a separate area (classroom or outdoor area if weather permits).
Limit the mixing of your children, such as staggering your playground times and keeping groups separate for special activities such as art, music, and exercising.
If possible, at nap time, ensure that children’s naptime mats (or cribs) are spaced out as much as possible.
Consider placing children (or infants in cribs) head to toe in order to further reduce the potential for viral spread.
Staggering Schedule (Parent Drop-Off and Pick-Up)
Stagger child arrival, drop-off, and pick-up times or locations by group, or put in place other plans to limit contact between groups and to limit staff’s direct contact with parents, guardians, and caregivers.
Consider going outside your child care center or family child care home to pick up children as they arrive.
A plan for curb side drop-off and pick-up should limit direct contact between parents/guardians and staff members and ensure 6 feet distance between adults.
You can transport infants in their car seats and then store car seats out of children’s reach.
If curbside, outdoor, or staggered pick up and drop off are not feasible, consider how you limit or decrease direct contact between parents, guardians, and caregivers to ensure physical distancing when possible.
Hand hygiene stations should be set up at the entrance of the child care center or family child care home, so that staff and children (over age 2) can use hand sanitizer before they enter.
If a sink with soap and water is not available, provide hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol next to parent sign-in sheets or the door to the home.
Keep hand sanitizer out of children’s reach and supervise use for children under 6 years old.
If possible, place sign-in stations outside and provide sanitary wipes for cleaning pens between each use.
Gatherings, Visitors, and Field Trips
Pursue virtual group events, gatherings, or meetings involving families, if possible, and promote distancing of at least 6 feet between people if events are held in person.
Avoid events that involve mixing children or families from different cohorts.
Limit your group size to the extent possible.
Limit any nonessential visitors, volunteers, and activities involving external groups or organizations.
For family child care homes, consider minimizing contact between children in your care and others who are not a part of child care program.
If there are other people living in the home who are not part of the child care program, consider having them stay in a different part of the home.
If they will need to be in shared areas, have them wear a mask and maintain as much physical distance as possible.
Limit or avoid having nonessential visitors enter the family child care home during child care hours.
While limiting the number of people entering your facility, it is important not to limit access for mothers who are breastfeeding to meet the nutritional needs of their infants.

Designated COVID-19 Point of Contact
Designate someone to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns.
Make sure staff and families know who their designated person is and how to contact them.
In a family child care home, the provider is the designated contact person.
Travel and Transit
Encourage staff who use public transportation or ride sharing to use forms of transportation that minimize close contact with others to the extent feasible (for example, biking, walking, driving or riding by car either alone or with household members).
Encourage staff who use public transportation or ride sharing to follow CDC guidance on how to protect yourself when using transportation.
Communication
Put systems in place for staff and families to self-report to your child care program if a staff member, child, or household member has symptoms of COVID-19, tests positive for COVID-19, or was exposed to someone with COVID-19 within the last 14 days.
Your reporting system should be consistent with state requirements as applicable with state regulatory and the health information sharing regulations for COVID-19external icon (for example see “Notify Health Officials and Close Contacts” in the Preparing for When Someone Gets Sick section below) and other applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy and confidentiality.
Your communication methods should be accessible for all your families and staff, including those with disabilities and limited English proficiency (for example, use interpreters and translated materials).
Notify your staff and families of closures and any restrictions in place to limit COVID-19 exposure (for example, limited hours of operation).
Leave (Time Off) Policies and Excused Absence Policies
Staff who are at increased risk of exposure to patients with COVID-19, such as those caring for sick family members, increase the risk of spreading COVID-19 in your facility.
To minimize the likelihood of infecting others in the facility, consider implementing flexible sick leave policies and practices that enable your staff to stay home when they are sick, have been exposed, or are caring for someone who is sick.
Leave policies should be flexible, not punish people for taking time off, and allow your sick employees to stay home and away from co-workers and children.
Leave policies should account for employees who need to stay home with their children if there are school or child care closures, or to care for sick family members.
Additional flexibilities might include permitting advances on future sick leave days and allowing employees to donate sick leave to each other.
Develop policies for return-to-work after a COVID-19 illness or exposure.
CDC’s criteria to discontinue home isolation and quarantine can inform these policies.
Back-Up Staffing Plan
Monitor absenteeism of your children and staff to ensure proper provider-to-child ratios are being maintained as stated by licensing regulations.
Cross-train your staff and create a roster of trained back-up staff that have successfully completed background checks.
Develop plans to cover your child care classrooms in the event of increased staff absences.
Coordinate with other local child care programs and reach out to substitutes to determine their anticipated availability if your regular staff members need to stay home due to illness or ill family members.
Family child care home providers should arrange for a backup family child care provider in case the provider or others in the family child care home become ill.
Staff Training
Train your child care program staff on all COVID-19 safety protocols and ensure they understand and can implement your new policies or procedures.
This training may count toward or be implemented in addition to required health and safety training.
Allow time for staff to voice concerns, identify areas of needed support and training, and give input into ways to implement your new COVID-19 protocols in your facility.
Conduct training virtually or ensure that prevention strategies to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread, including physical distancing is maintained during in-person training.
Recognize Signs and Symptoms of COVID-19
The best way to prevent the COVID-19 spread is to keep the virus from getting into your child care program in the first place.
It is important to communicate to parents, guardians, or caregivers to monitor their children every day for signs of infectious illness including COVID-19.
Children who have symptoms of any infectious illness or symptoms of COVID-19 should not attend your child care program.
The length of time the child should stay out of child care depends on whether the child has COVID-19 or another illness.
Conduct daily health screeningsexternal icon for any person entering the child care facility, including children, staff, family members, and other visitors, to find those with symptoms, diagnosis, or exposure to COVID-19.
People with COVID-19 can have symptoms ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.
Symptoms can appear 2–14 days after exposure to COVID-19.
See Symptoms of Coronavirus and COVID-19 in Children for more information.
Screening for symptoms and for possible exposure to the virus are important COVID-19 prevention strategies.
However, given the wide range of symptoms and the fact that many people, especially children, with COVID-19 illness have no symptoms at all, screening will not identify everyone who has COVID-19.
The overlap between COVID-19 symptoms with other common illnesses means that some people with symptoms of COVID-19 could be ill with something else.
This is even more likely in young children, who typically have multiple viral illnesses each year.
For example, it is common for young children to have up to eight respiratory illnesses or “colds” every year.
11) Although COVID-19, colds, and flu illnesses have similar symptoms, they are different diseases.
For some children, COVID-19 can have serious complications.
Download this table comparing symptoms of COVID-19 with other common illnesses pdf icon[579 KB, 1 page].
Examples of daily health screenings include self-checks for symptoms by staff and families before arriving at the child care facility, answering screening questions upon arrival, and performing daily temperature checks.
All child care providers should consider putting into practice a daily routine of conducting a brief verbal health assessment as your children are dropped off, before the parent or caregiver leaves, that asks about
Fever equal to or higher than 100.
4oF
If the child has been exposed to someone with known COVID-19
If the child is being tested for COVID-19
If the child has been diagnosed with COVID-19 and not yet cleared to discontinue isolation
People who have a fever of 100.
40 (38.00C) or above or other signs of illness should not be admitted to your child care facility.
Encourage your families to be on the alert for signs of illness in their children and to keep them home when they are sick.
Examples of Screening Methods
If you choose to implement onsite temperature screening, there are several methods your facility can use to protect child care program staff while conducting temperature screenings.
The most effective protective methods incorporate maintaining physical distance (using a no-contact remote thermometer) and keeping screening interactions brief to minimize exposure due to close contact to a child or adult during screening.
Screening Method 1: Parent or guardian takes temperature while staff physically distance
Maintain 6 feet distance from families and wear a mask, no personal protective equipment (PPE) necessary.
Parents/guardians take their children’s temperature either at home before coming to the facility or upon arrival at the facility using a no-contact thermometer.
Make a visual check of the child for signs of illness, which could include flushed cheeks, rapid breathing or difficulty breathing (without recent physical activity), fatigue, or extreme fussiness, and confirm that the child is not experiencing coughing or shortness of breath.
Parent/guardian confirms that the child does not have fever, shortness of breath, cough or other symptoms of COVID-19.
Screening Method 2: Staff take temperature
Stand behind a physical barrier (such as a glass or plastic window or partition) that can serve to protect the staff member’s face, mouth, and nose from respiratory droplets that can be produced if the child being screened sneezes, coughs, or talks.
Conduct temperature screening (follow steps below) using a no-contact remote thermometer, while wearing disposable gloves.
Always make sure your face stays behind the barrier during the screening.
If you did not have physical contact with the child, you do not need to change gloves before the next check and you do not need to clean a no-contact remote thermometer with alcohol after each child.
If your program chooses to conduct symptom screening, they should be conducted safely and respectfully, and in accordance with any applicable privacy laws and regulations (for example, Americans with Disabilities Actexternal icon and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)external icon.
The guidance detailed here are intended for children, but a similar process can be followed for screening staff.
For specific considerations related to screening staff, please refer to CDC’s Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers Responding to Coronavirus Disease 2019 and the Prevent Transmission Among Employees section of CDC’s Resuming Business Toolkit pdf icon[1.
Prepare for When Someone is Sick with COVID-19
Your child care program should implement multiple COVID-19 prevention actions to prepare for when someone is sick with COVID-19.
Isolation and Transportation of Children and Staff Who Begin to Have Symptoms While at the Child Care Program
Your children or staff might begin to have COVID-19 symptoms while at your facility.
You should take action to isolate people who begin to have these symptoms from other children and staff.
Plan to have an isolation room or an area, preferably with access to a separate restroom, you can use to isolate a sick child or staff member.
Ensure that isolated children are still under adult supervision.
Arrange safe transportation home or to a healthcare facility (if severe symptoms) for the child or staff if showing symptoms of COVID-19.
Close off areas used by a sick person and do not use these areas until after cleaning and disinfecting them;
this includes surfaces or shared objects in the area, if applicable.
Wait at least 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting.
If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible and increase ventilation in the area.
You should ensure safe and proper use of cleaning and disinfection productsexternal icon, including storing products securely away from children.
See CDC’s Toolkit for Child Care Programs for more resources on what to do if a child becomes sick while at the child care program.
Make Sure that Staff and Families Know When They Should Stay Home
Communicate with your staff and the families of your children so that they know when to stay home.
Make sure they know to notify your child care program administrator (for example, the designated COVID-19 point of contact) if they (staff) or their child (families) test positive for COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms or a confirmed or suspected case.
For information on getting tested for COVID-19 and to find testing sites in your community, reach out to your healthcare provider or contact your local health department.
These critical communications should be accessible to people with disabilities and limited English proficiency.
Follow Home Isolation and Quarantine Criteria
Sick staff or children should not return to your child care program until they have met CDC’s criteria to discontinue home isolation.
If they have met all the CDC criteria for ending isolation, then no additional testing is needed in order to return to the facility.
Return-to-Child Care Policies
If staff, children, or family members have or think they might have COVID-19, it is important to stay home and away from other people.
In most instances, those who have had COVID-19 can be around others after
10 days since symptoms first appeared and
24 hours with no fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and
Other symptoms of COVID-19 are improving
Most people do not require testing to decide when they can be around others;
however, if your healthcare provider recommends testing, they will let you know when you can resume being around others based on your test results.
Note that these recommendations do not apply to people with severe COVID-19 or with severely weakened immune systems (immunocompromised).
These individuals should follow the advice of their healthcare provider regarding when to resume being around others.
For Anyone Who Has Had Close Contact with a Person with COVID-19
Anyone who has had close contact with someone who has (suspected or confirmed) COVID-19 should stay home for 14 days after their last exposure to that person.
Close contact is defined as within 6 feet of an infected person for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period.
Notifications and Possible Closure of Facility
In accordance with state and local laws and regulations, your child care program should notify local health officials, staff, and families immediately of any case of COVID-19 while maintaining confidentiality in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)external icon or any other applicable laws and regulations.
Inform those who have had close contact with a child or staff member diagnosed with COVID-19 to stay home and self-monitor for symptoms, and follow CDC guidance if they have COVID-19 symptoms.
You will need to maintain confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or and other applicable laws and regulations.
Your child care program might need to implement short-term building closure procedures if an infected person has been at the facility during their infectious period and has close contact with others.
If this happens, work with local public health officials to determine next steps.
One option is for you to have an initial short-term closure and cancellation of events and activities to allow time for your local health officials to gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 situation and help your child care program determine appropriate next steps, including whether such a closure needs to be extended to stop or slow further spread of COVID-19.
In situations where your child care program is cohorting (for example, staying in a small group of just their class), your administrator may choose to close certain places in the building (for example, classrooms, common areas) where others were exposed to the sick person.
If your local health officials do not recommend building or child care classroom closures, thoroughly clean and disinfect areas where the infected person spent significant time.
Local health officials will decide whether and for how long to close your child care program or events.
Sharing Facilities
Encourage any organization that shares or uses your child care facility to also follow this guidance and the multiple prevention strategies you put in place.
Support Coping and Resilience
Remain as transparent as possible (communicate openly) about program and policy changes.
You can solicit staff input in decisions about new process and procedures to assist staff in feeling increased sense of control and reducing anxiety.
Promote healthy eating habits, physical activity, getting sleep, and finding time to unwind among staff, families, and children.
Discuss and share stress reduction strategies such as mindfulness practices, social support, deep breathing, and spending time in nature or outside.
Encourage staff and older children to talk with people they trust about their concerns and how they are feeling.
Communicate openly with staff, children, and families about mental health support services available in the community, including if mental health consultation is available to the program.
Share facts about COVID-19 regularly through trusted sources of information (such as your state health department or CDC) to counter the spread of misinformation and ease fear.
Consider posting signage for the national distress hotline: 1-800-985-5990, or text TalkWithUs to 66746.
Encourage staff to call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255), 1-888-628-9454 for Spanish, or Lifeline Crisis Chatexternal icon if they are feeling overwhelmed with emotions such as sadness, depression, anxiety; or call 911 if they feel like they want to harm themselves or others.
How COVID-19 Spreads
Updated May 13, 2021
Print
COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus.
These droplets and particles can be breathed in by other people or land on their eyes, noses, or mouth.
In some circumstances, they may contaminate surfaces they touch.
People who are closer than 6 feet from the infected person are most likely to get infected.
COVID-19 is spread in three main ways:
Breathing in air when close to an infected person who is exhaling small droplets and particles that contain the virus.
Having these small droplets and particles that contain virus land on the eyes, nose, or mouth, especially through splashes and sprays like a cough or sneeze.
Touching eyes, nose, or mouth with hands that have the virus on them.
Protect Yourself and Others
Anyone infected with COVID-19 can spread it, even if they do NOT have symptoms.
To protect yourself against getting COVID-19 from inhalation:
Get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as you can.
Wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth to help protect yourself and others.
Stay 6 feet apart.
Avoid crowds and poorly ventilated spaces, and improve ventilation.
To protect yourself against getting COVID-19 from splashes or sprays:
Avoid crowds.
To protect yourself against getting COVID-19 from touching your eyes, nose, or mouth:
Wash your hands.
Learn more about what you can do to protect yourself and others and what you can do after you’ve been fully vaccinated.
COVID-19 and Animals
COVID-19 can spread from people to animals in some situations.
Pet cats and dogs can sometimes become infected after close contact with people with COVID-19.
Learn what you should do if you have pets.
Reinfection
Cases of reinfection with COVID-19 have been reported, but remain rare​.
​ CDC is actively working to learn more about reinfection to inform public health action.
Steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 if you are sick
If you are sick with COVID-19 or think you might have COVID-19, follow the steps below to care for yourself and to help protect other people in your home and community.

Stay home except to get medical care
Stay home.
Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care.
Do not leave your home, except to get medical care.
Do not visit public areas.
Take care of yourself.
Get rest and stay hydrated.
Take over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen, to help you feel better.
Stay in touch with your doctor.
Call before you get medical care.
Be sure to get care if you have trouble breathing, or have any other emergency warning signs, or if you think it is an emergency.
Avoid public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis.
bed light icon
Separate yourself from other people
As much as possible, stay in a specific room and away from other people and pets in your home.
If possible, you should use a separate bathroom.
If you need to be around other people or animals in or outside of the home, wear a mask.
Tell your close contacts that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.
An infected person can spread COVID-19 starting 48 hours (or 2 days) before the person has any symptoms or tests positive.
By letting your close contacts know they may have been exposed to COVID-19, you are helping to protect everyone.
Additional guidance is available for those living in close quarters and shared housing.
See COVID-19 and Animals if you have questions about pets.
If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, someone from the health department may call you.
Answer the call to slow the spread.

Monitor your symptoms
Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, or other symptoms.
Follow care instructions from your healthcare provider and local health department.
Your local health authorities may give instructions on checking your symptoms and reporting information.
When to seek emergency medical attention
Look for emergency warning signs* for COVID-19.
If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately:
Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
Inability to wake or stay awake
Pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds, depending on skin tone
*This list is not all possible symptoms.
Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.
Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility: Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19.

Get Tested
If you have symptoms of COVID-19, get tested.
While waiting for test results pdf icon[224 KB, 2 pages], you stay away from others, including staying apart from those living in your household.
You can visit your state, tribal, localexternal icon, and territorial health department’s website to look for the latest local information on testing sites.
head side mask light icon
If you are sick, wear a mask over your nose and mouth
You should wear a mask over your nose and mouth if you must be around other people or animals, including pets (even at home).
You don’t need to wear the mask if you are alone.
If you can’t put on a mask (because of trouble breathing, for example), cover your coughs and sneezes in some other way.
Try to stay at least 6 feet away from other people.
This will help protect the people around you.
Masks should not be placed on young children under age 2 years, anyone who has trouble breathing, or anyone who is not able to remove the mask without help.
Note: During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical grade facemasks are reserved for healthcare workers and some first responders.

Clean all “high-touch” surfaces everyday
Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces in your “sick room” and bathroom; wear disposable gloves.
Let someone else clean and disinfect surfaces in common areas, but you should clean your bedroom and bathroom, if possible.
If a caregiver or other person needs to clean and disinfect a sick person’s bedroom or bathroom, they should do so on an as-needed basis.
The caregiver/other person should wear a mask and disposable gloves prior to cleaning.
They should wait as long as possible after the person who is sick has used the bathroom before coming in to clean and use the bathroom.
High-touch surfaces include phones, remote controls, counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, keyboards, tablets, and bedside tables.
Clean and disinfect areas that may have blood, stool, or body fluids on them.
Use household cleaners and disinfectants.
Clean the area or item with soap and water or another detergent if it is dirty.
Then, use a household disinfectant.

Complete Disinfection Guidance
I think or know I had COVID-19, and I had symptoms
You can be around others after:
Other symptoms of COVID-19 are improving*
Loss of taste and smell may persist for weeks or months after recovery and need not delay the end of isolation​
Most people do not require testing to decide when they can be around others; however, if your healthcare provider recommends testing, they will let you know when you can resume being around others based on your test results.
Note that these recommendations do not apply to persons with severe COVID-19 or with severely weakened immune systems (immunocompromised).
These persons should follow the guidance below for “I was severely ill with COVID-19 or have a severely weakened immune system (immunocompromised) due to a health condition or medication.
When can I be around others?
I tested positive for COVID-19 but had no symptoms
If you continue to have no symptoms, you can be with others after 10 days have passed since you had a positive viral test for COVID-19.
If you develop symptoms after testing positive, follow the guidance above for “I think or know I had COVID-19, and I had symptoms.
I was severely ill with COVID-19 or have a severely weakened immune system (immunocompromised) due to a health condition or medication.
People who are severely ill with COVID-19 might need to stay home longer than 10 days and up to 20 days after symptoms first appeared.
Persons who are severely immunocompromised may require testing to determine when they can be around others.
Talk to your healthcare provider for more information.
If testing is available in your community, it may be recommended by your healthcare provider.
Your healthcare provider will let you know if you can resume being around other people based on the results of your testing.
Your doctor may work with an infectious disease expert or your local health department to determine whether testing will be necessary before you can be around others.
For Anyone Who Has Been Around a Person with COVID-19
Anyone who has had close contact with someone with COVID-19 should stay home for 14 days after their last exposure to that person.
The best way to protect yourself and others is to stay home for 14 days if you think you’ve been exposed to someone who has COVID-19.
Check your local health department’s website for information about options in your area to possibly shorten this quarantine period.
However, anyone who has had close contact with someone with COVID-19 and who meets the following criteria does NOT need to stay home.
Someone who has been fully vaccinated and shows no symptoms of COVID-19
Someone who has COVID-19 illness within the previous 3 months and
Has recovered and
Remains without COVID-19 symptoms (for example, cough, shortness of breath)
Confirmed and suspected cases of reinfection of the virus that causes COVID-19
Cases of reinfection of COVID-19 have been reported but are rare.
In general, reinfection means a person was infected (got sick) once, recovered, and then later became infected again.
Based on what we know from similar viruses, some reinfections are expected.
For Healthcare Professionals
If you are a healthcare professional who thinks or knows you had COVID-19, you should follow the same recommendations listed above for when you can resume being around others outside the workplace.
When you can return to work depends on different factors and situations.
For information on when you can return to work, see the following:
We all have been affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic.
However, the impact of the pandemic and its consequences are felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society.
While some try to adapt to working online, homeschooling their children and ordering food via Instacart, others have no choice but to be exposed to the virus while keeping society functioning.
Our different social identities and the social groups we belong to determine our inclusion within society and, by extension, our vulnerability to epidemics.
COVID-19 is killing people on a large scale.
As of October 10, 2020, more than 7.
7 million people across every state in the United States and its four territories had tested positive for COVID-19.
According to the New York Times database, at least 213,876 people with the virus have died in the United States.
However, these alarming numbers give us only half of the picture; a closer look at data by different social identities (such as class, gender, age, race, and medical history) shows that minorities have been disproportionally affected by the pandemic.
These minorities in the United States are not having their right to health fulfilled.
According to the World Health Organization’s report Closing the Gap in a Generation: Health Equity through Action on the Social Determinants of Health, “poor and unequal living conditions are the consequences of deeper structural conditions that together fashion the way societies are organized—poor social policies and programs, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics.This toxic combination of factors as they play out during this time of crisis, and as early news on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic pointed out, is disproportionately affecting African American communities in the United States.
I recognize that the pandemic has had and is having devastating effects on other minorities as well, but space does not permit this essay to explore the impact on other minority groups.
Employing a human rights lens in this analysis helps us translate needs and social problems into rights, focusing our attention on the broader sociopolitical structural context as the cause of the social problems.
Human rights highlight the inherent dignity and worth of all people, who are the primary rights-holders.
Governments (and other social actors, such as corporations) are the duty-bearers, and as such have the obligation to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights.
Human rights cannot be separated from the societal contexts in which they are recognized, claimed, enforced, and fulfilled.
Specifically, social rights, which include the right to health, can become important tools for advancing people’s citizenship and enhancing their ability to participate as active members of society.
Such an understanding of social rights calls our attention to the concept of equality, which requires that we place a greater emphasis on “solidarity” and the “collective.Furthermore, in order to generate equality, solidarity, and social integration, the fulfillment of social rights is not optional.
In order to fulfill social integration, social policies need to reflect a commitment to respect and protect the most vulnerable individuals and to create the conditions for the fulfillment of economic and social rights for all.
Disproportional impact of COVID-19 on African Americans
As noted by Samuel Dickman et al.
economic inequality in the US has been increasing for decades and is now among the highest in developed countries … As economic inequality in the US has deepened, so too has inequality in health.
Both overall and government health spending are higher in the US than in other countries, yet inadequate insurance coverage, high-cost sharing by patients, and geographical barriers restrict access to care for many.
For instance, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, in 2018, 11.7% of African Americans in the United States had no health insurance, compared to 7.5% of whites.
Prior to the Affordable Care Act—enacted into law in 2010—about 20% of African Americans were uninsured.
This act helped lower the uninsured rate among nonelderly African Americans by more than one-third between 2013 and 2016, from 18.9% to 11.7%.
However, even after the law’s passage, African Americans have higher uninsured rates than whites (7.5%) and Asian Americans (6.3%).
The uninsured are far more likely than the insured to forgo needed medical visits, tests, treatments, and medications because of cost.
As the COVID-19 virus made its way throughout the United States, testing kits were distributed equally among labs across the 50 states, without consideration of population density or actual needs for testing in those states.
An opportunity to stop the spread of the virus during its early stages was missed, with serious consequences for many Americans.
Although there is a dearth of race-disaggregated data on the number of people tested, the data that are available highlight African Americans’ overall lack of access to testing.
For example, in Kansas, as of June 27, according to the COVID Racial Data Tracker, out of 94,780 tests, only 4,854 were from black Americans and 50,070 were from whites.
However, blacks make up almost a third of the state’s COVID-19 deaths (59 of 208).
And while in Illinois the total numbers of confirmed cases among blacks and whites were almost even, the test numbers show a different picture: 220,968 whites were tested, compared to only 78,650 blacks.
Similarly, American Public Media reported on the COVID-19 mortality rate by race/ethnicity through July 21, 2020, including Washington, DC, and 45 states (see figure 1).
These data, while showing an alarming death rate for all races, demonstrate how minorities are hit harder and how, among minority groups, the African American population in many states bears the brunt of the pandemic’s health impact.
Approximately 97.9 out of every 100,000 African Americans have died from COVID-19, a mortality rate that is a third higher than that for Latinos (64.7 per 100,000), and more than double than that for whites (46.6 per 100,000) and Asians (40.4 per 100,000).
The overrepresentation of African Americans among confirmed COVID-19 cases and number of deaths underscores the fact that the coronavirus pandemic, far from being an equalizer, is amplifying or even worsening existing social inequalities tied to race, class, and access to the health care system.
Considering how African Americans and other minorities are overrepresented among those getting infected and dying from COVID-19, experts recommend that more testing be done in minority communities and that more medical services be provided.
Although the law requires insurers to cover testing for patients who go to their doctor’s office or who visit urgent care or emergency rooms, patients are fearful of ending up with a bill if their visit does not result in a COVID test.
Furthermore, minority patients who lack insurance or are underinsured are less likely to be tested for COVID-19, even when experiencing alarming symptoms.
These inequitable outcomes suggest the importance of increasing the number of testing centers and contact tracing in communities where African Americans and other minorities reside; providing testing beyond symptomatic individuals; ensuring that high-risk communities receive more health care workers; strengthening social provision programs to address the immediate needs of this population (such as food security, housing, and access to medicines); and providing financial protection for currently uninsured workers.
Social determinants of health and the pandemic’s impact on African Americans’ health outcomes
In international human rights law, the right to health is a claim to a set of social arrangements—norms, institutions, laws, and enabling environment—that can best secure the enjoyment of this right.
The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights sets out the core provision relating to the right to health under international law (article 12).
The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is the body responsible for interpreting the covenant.
In 2000, the committee adopted a general comment on the right to health recognizing that the right to health is closely related to and dependent on the realization of other human rights.
In addition, this general comment interprets the right to health as an inclusive right extending not only to timely and appropriate health care but also to the determinants of health.
I will reflect on four determinants of health—racism and discrimination, poverty, residential segregation, and underlying medical conditions—that have a significant impact on the health outcomes of African Americans.
Racism and discrimination
In spite of growing interest in understanding the association between the social determinants of health and health outcomes, for a long time many academics, policy makers, elected officials, and others were reluctant to identify racism as one of the root causes of racial health inequities.
To date, many of the studies conducted to investigate the effect of racism on health have focused mainly on interpersonal racial and ethnic discrimination, with comparatively less emphasis on investigating the health outcomes of structural racism.
The latter involves interconnected institutions whose linkages are historically rooted and culturally reinforced.
In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, acts of discrimination are taking place in a variety of contexts (for example, social, political, and historical).
In some ways, the pandemic has exposed existing racism and discrimination.
Poverty (low-wage jobs, insurance coverage, homelessness, and jails and prisons)
Data drawn from the 2018 Current Population Survey to assess the characteristics of low-income families by race and ethnicity shows that of the 7.
5 million low-income families with children in the United States, 20.
8% were black or African American (while their percentage of the population in 2018 was only 13.4%).
Low-income racial and ethnic minorities tend to live in densely populated areas and multigenerational households.
These living conditions make it difficult for low-income families to take necessary precautions for their safety and the safety of their loved ones on a regular basis.
This fact becomes even more crucial during a pandemic.
Low-wage jobs: The types of work where people in some racial and ethnic groups are overrepresented can also contribute to their risk of getting sick with COVID-19.
Nearly 40% of African American workers, more than seven million, are low-wage workers and have jobs that deny them even a single paid sick day.
Workers without paid sick leave might be more likely to continue to work even when they are sick.
This can increase workers’ exposure to other workers who may be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
Similarly, the Centers for Disease Control has noted that many African Americans who hold low-wage but essential jobs (such as food service, public transit, and health care) are required to continue to interact with the public, despite outbreaks in their communities, which exposes them to higher risks of COVID-19 infection.
According to the Centers for Disease Control, nearly a quarter of employed Hispanic and black or African American workers are employed in service industry jobs, compared to 16% of non-Hispanic whites.
Blacks or African Americans make up 12% of all employed workers but account for 30% of licensed practical and licensed vocational nurses, who face significant exposure to the coronavirus.
In 2018, 45% of low-wage workers relied on an employer for health insurance.
This situation forces low-wage workers to continue to go to work even when they are not feeling well.
Some employers allow their workers to be absent only when they test positive for COVID-19.
Given the way the virus spreads, by the time a person knows they are infected, they have likely already infected many others in close contact with them both at home and at work.
Homelessness: Staying home is not an option for the homeless.
African Americans, despite making up just 13% of the US population, account for about 40% of the nation’s homeless population, according to the Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress.
Given that people experiencing homelessness often live in close quarters, have compromised immune systems, and are aging, they are exceptionally vulnerable to communicable diseases—including the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
Jails and prisons: Nearly 2.
2 million people are in US jails and prisons, the highest rate in the world.
According to the US Bureau of Justice, in 2018, the imprisonment rate among black men was 5.
8 times that of white men, while the imprisonment rate among black women was 1.
8 times the rate among white women.
This overrepresentation of African Americans in US jails and prisons is another indicator of the social and economic inequality affecting this population.
According to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights’ General Comment 14, “states are under the obligation to respect the right to health by, inter alia, refraining from denying or limiting equal access for all persons—including prisoners or detainees, minorities, asylum seekers and illegal immigrants—to preventive, curative, and palliative health services.Moreover, “states have an obligation to ensure medical care for prisoners at least equivalent to that available to the general population.However, there has been a very limited response to preventing transmission of the virus within detention facilities, which cannot achieve the physical distancing needed to effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Residential segregation
Segregation affects people’s access to healthy foods and green space.
It can also increase excess exposure to pollution and environmental hazards, which in turn increases the risk for diabetes and heart and kidney diseases.
African Americans living in impoverished, segregated neighborhoods may live farther away from grocery stores, hospitals, and other medical facilities.
These and other social and economic inequalities, more so than any genetic or biological predisposition, have also led to higher rates of African Americans contracting the coronavirus.
To this effect, sociologist Robert Sampson states that the coronavirus is exposing class and race-based vulnerabilities.
He refers to this factor as “toxic inequality,” especially the clustering of COVID-19 cases by community, and reminds us that African Americans, even if they are at the same level of income or poverty as white Americans or Latino Americans, are much more likely to live in neighborhoods that have concentrated poverty, polluted environments, lead exposure, higher rates of incarceration, and higher rates of violence.
Many of these factors lead to long-term health consequences.
The pandemic is concentrating in urban areas with high population density, which are, for the most part, neighborhoods where marginalized and minority individuals live.
In times of COVID-19, these concentrations place a high burden on the residents and on already stressed hospitals in these regions.
Strategies most recommended to control the spread of COVID-19—social distancing and frequent hand washing—are not always practical for those who are incarcerated or for the millions who live in highly dense communities with precarious or insecure housing, poor sanitation, and limited access to clean water.
Underlying health conditions
African Americans have historically been disproportionately diagnosed with chronic diseases such as asthma, hypertension and diabetes—underlying conditions that may make COVID-19 more lethal.
Perhaps there has never been a pandemic that has brought these disparities so vividly into focus.
Doctor Anthony Fauci, an immunologist who has been the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, has noted that “it is not that [African Americans] are getting infected more often.
It’s that when they do get infected, their underlying medical conditions … wind them up in the ICU and ultimately give them a higher death rate.[33]
One of the highest risk factors for COVID-19-related death among African Americans is hypertension.
A recent study by Khansa Ahmad et al.
analyzed the correlation between poverty and cardiovascular diseases, an indicator of why so many black lives are lost in the current health crisis.
The authors note that the American health care system has not yet been able to address the higher propensity of lower socioeconomic classes to suffer from cardiovascular disease.
Besides having higher prevalence of chronic conditions compared to whites, African Americans experience higher death rates.
These trends existed prior to COVID-19, but this pandemic has made them more visible and worrisome.
Addressing the impact of COVID-19 on African Americans: A human rights-based approach
The racially disparate death rate and socioeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the discriminatory enforcement of pandemic-related restrictions stand in stark contrast to the United States’ commitment to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination.
In 1965, the United States signed the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which it ratified in 1994.
Article 2 of the convention contains fundamental obligations of state parties, which are further elaborated in articles 5, 6, and 7.
Article 2 of the convention stipulates that “each State Party shall take effective measures to review governmental, national and local policies, and to amend, rescind or nullify any laws and regulations which have the effect of creating or perpetuating racial discrimination wherever it exists” and that “each State Party shall prohibit and bring to an end, by all appropriate means, including legislation as required by circumstances, racial discrimination by any persons, group or organization.[36]
Perhaps this crisis will not only greatly affect the health of our most vulnerable community members but also focus public attention on their rights and safety—or lack thereof.
Disparate COVID-19 mortality rates among the African American population reflect longstanding inequalities rooted in systemic and pervasive problems in the United States (for example, racism and the inadequacy of the country’s health care system).
As noted by Audrey Chapman, “the purpose of a human right is to frame public policies and private behaviors so as to protect and promote the human dignity and welfare of all members and groups within society, particularly those who are vulnerable and poor, and to effectively implement them.A deeper awareness of inequity and the role of social determinants demonstrates the importance of using right to health paradigms in response to the pandemic.
The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has proposed some guidelines regarding states’ obligation to fulfill economic and social rights: availability, accessibility, acceptability, and quality.
These four interrelated elements are essential to the right to health.
They serve as a framework to evaluate states’ performance in relation to their obligation to fulfill these rights.
In the context of this pandemic, it is worthwhile to raise the following questions: What can governments and nonstate actors do to avoid further marginalizing or stigmatizing this and other vulnerable populations?
How can health justice and human rights-based approaches ground an effective response to the pandemic now and build a better world afterward?
What can be done to ensure that responses to COVID-19 are respectful of the rights of African Americans?
These questions demand targeted responses not just in treatment but also in prevention.
The following are just some initial reflections:
First, we need to keep in mind that treating people with respect and human dignity is a fundamental obligation, and the first step in a health crisis.
This includes the recognition of the inherent dignity of people, the right to self-determination, and equality for all individuals.
A commitment to cure and prevent COVID-19 infections must be accompanied by a renewed commitment to restore justice and equity.
Second, we need to strike a balance between mitigation strategies and the protection of civil liberties, without destroying the economy and material supports of society, especially as they relate to minorities and vulnerable populations.
As stated in the Siracusa Principles, “[state restrictions] are only justified when they support a legitimate aim and are: provided for by law, strictly necessary, proportionate, of limited duration, and subject to review against abusive applications.Therefore, decisions about individual and collective isolation and quarantine must follow standards of fair and equal treatment and avoid stigma and discrimination against individuals or groups.
Vulnerable populations require direct consideration with regard to the development of policies that can also protect and secure their inalienable rights.
Third, long-term solutions require properly identifying and addressing the underlying obstacles to the fulfillment of the right to health, particularly as they affect the most vulnerable.
For example, we need to design policies aimed at providing universal health coverage, paid family leave, and sick leave.
We need to reduce food insecurity, provide housing, and ensure that our actions protect the climate.
Moreover, we need to strengthen mental health and substance abuse services, since this pandemic is affecting people’s mental health and exacerbating ongoing issues with mental health and chemical dependency.
As noted earlier, violations of the human rights principles of equality and nondiscrimination were already present in US society prior to the pandemic.
However, the pandemic has caused “an unprecedented combination of adversities which presents a serious threat to the mental health of entire populations, and especially to groups in vulnerable situations.As Dainius Pūras has noted, “the best way to promote good mental health is to invest in protective environments in all settings.These actions should take place as we engage in thoughtful conversations that allow us to assess the situation, to plan and implement necessary interventions, and to evaluate their effectiveness.
Finally, it is important that we collect meaningful, systematic, and disaggregated data by race, age, gender, and class.
Such data are useful not only for promoting public trust but for understanding the full impact of this pandemic and how different systems of inequality intersect, affecting the lived experiences of minority groups and beyond.
It is also important that such data be made widely available, so as to enhance public awareness of the problem and inform interventions and public policies.
Conclusion
In 1966, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
said, “Of all forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and inhuman.More than 54 years later, African Americans still suffer from injustices that are at the basis of income and health disparities.
We know from previous experiences that epidemics place increased demands on scarce resources and enormous stress on social and economic systems.
A deeper understanding of the social determinants of health in the context of the current crisis, and of the role that these factors play in mediating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on African Americans’ health outcomes, increases our awareness of the indivisibility of all human rights and the collective dimension of the right to health.
We need a more explicit equity agenda that encompasses both formal and substantive equality.
Besides nondiscrimination and equality, participation and accountability are equally crucial.
Unfortunately, as suggested by the limited available data, African American communities and other minorities in the United States are bearing the brunt of the current pandemic.
The COVID-19 crisis has served to unmask higher vulnerabilities and exposure among people of color.
A thorough reflection on how to close this gap needs to start immediately.
Given that the COVID-19 pandemic is more than just a health crisis—it is disrupting and affecting every aspect of life (including family life, education, finances, and agricultural production)—it requires a multisectoral approach.
We need to build stronger partnerships among the health care sector and other social and economic sectors.
Working collaboratively to address the many interconnected issues that have emerged or become visible during this pandemic—particularly as they affect marginalized and vulnerable populations—offers a more effective strategy.
Moreover, as Delan Devakumar et al.
have noted:
the strength of a healthcare system is inseparable from broader social systems that surround it.
Health protection relies not only on a well-functioning health system with universal coverage, which the US could highly benefit from, but also on social inclusion, justice, and solidarity.
In the absence of these factors, inequalities are magnified and scapegoating persists, with discrimination remaining long after.
This current public health crisis demonstrates that we are all interconnected and that our well-being is contingent on that of others.
A renewed and healthy society is possible only if governments and public authorities commit to reducing vulnerability and the impact of ill-health by taking steps to respect, protect, and fulfill the right to health.
It requires that government and nongovernment actors establish policies and programs that promote the right to health in practice.
It calls for a shared commitment to justice and equality for all.

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which originated in the city of Wuhan, China, has quickly spread to various countries, with many cases having been reported worldwide.
As of May 8th, 2020, in India, 56,342 positive cases have been reported.
India, with a population of more than 1.
34 billion—the second largest population in the world—will have difficulty in controlling the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 among its population.
Multiple strategies would be highly necessary to handle the current outbreak; these include computational modeling, statistical tools, and quantitative analyses to control the spread as well as the rapid development of a new treatment.
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India has raised awareness about the recent outbreak and has taken necessary actions to control the spread of COVID-19.
The central and state governments are taking several measures and formulating several wartime protocols to achieve this goal.
Moreover, the Indian government implemented a 55-days lockdown throughout the country that started on March 25th, 2020, to reduce the transmission of the virus.
This outbreak is inextricably linked to the economy of the nation, as it has dramatically impeded industrial sectors because people worldwide are currently cautious about engaging in business in the affected regions.
Current Scenario in India
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city, China, and later spread to many provinces in China.
As of May 8th, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) had documented 3,759,967 positive COVID-19 cases, and the death toll attributed to COVID-19 had reached 259,474 worldwide (1).
So far, more than 212 countries and territories have confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
On January 30th, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (2).
The first SARS-CoV-2 positive case in India was reported in the state of Kerala on January 30th, 2020.
Subsequently, the number of cases drastically rose.
According to the press release by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on May 8th, 2020, a total of 14,37,788 suspected samples had been sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, and a related testing laboratory (3).
Among them, 56,342 cases tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (4).
A state-wise distribution of positive cases until May 8th, 2020, is listed in Table 1, and the cases have been depicted on an Indian map (Figure 1).
Nearly 197,192 Indians have recently been repatriated from affected regions, and more than 1,393,301 passengers have been screened for SARS-CoV-2 at Indian airports (5), with 111 positive cases observed among foreign nationals (4, 5).
As of May 8th, 2020, Maharashtra, Delhi, and Gujarat states were reported to be hotspots for COVID-19 with 17,974, 5,980, and 7,012 confirmed cases, respectively.
To date, 16,540 patients have recovered, and 1,886 deaths have been reported in India (5).
To impose social distancing, the “Janata curfew” (14-h lockdown) was ordered on March 22nd, 2020.
A further lockdown was initiated for 21 days, starting on March 25th, 2020, and the same was extended until May 3rd, 2020, but, owing to an increasing number of positive cases, the lockdown has been extended for the third time until May 17th, 2020 (6).
Currently, out of 32 states and eight union territories in India, 26 states and six union territories have reported COVID-19 cases.
Additionally, the health ministry has identified 130 districts as hotspot zones or red zones, 284 as orange zones (with few SARS-CoV-2 infections), and 319 as green zones (no SARS-CoV-2 infection) as of May 4th, 2020.
These hotspot districts have been identified to report more than 80% of the cases across the nation.
Nineteen districts in Uttar Pradesh are identified as hotspot districts, and this was followed by 14 and 12 districts in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, respectively (7).
The complete lockdown was implemented in these containment zones to stop/limit community transmission (5).
As of May 8th, 2020, 310 government laboratories and 111 private laboratories across the country were involved in SARS-CoV-2 testing.
As per ICMR report, 14,37,788 samples were tested till date, which is 1.
04 per thousand people (3).

COVID-19 and Previous Coronavirus Outbreaks
The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in several countries is similar to the previous outbreaks of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) that emerged in 2003 and 2012 in China and Saudi Arabia, respectively (8–10).
Coronavirus is responsible for both SARS and COVID-19 diseases; they affect the respiratory tract and cause major disease outbreaks worldwide.
SARS is caused by SARS-CoV, whereas SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19.
So far, there is no particular treatment available to treat SARS or COVID-19.
In the current search for a COVID-19 cure, there is some evidence that point to SARS-CoV-2 being similar to human coronavirus HKU1 and 229E strains (11, 12) even though they are new coronavirus family members.
These reports suggest that humans do not have immunity to this virus, allowing its easy and rapid spread among human populations through contact with an infected person.
SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible than SARS-CoV.
The two possible reasons could be (i) the viral load (quantity of virus) tends to be relatively higher in COVID-19-positive patients, especially in the nose and throat immediately after they develop symptoms, and (ii) the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to host cell receptors is higher than that of SARS-CoV (13, 14).
The other comparisons between SARS and COVID-19 are tabulated in Table 2, and references for the same are provided here (1, 15, 16).
Differences between coronavirus disease and severe acute respiratory syndrome.
Impact of COVID-19 in India and the Global Economy
As per the official government guidelines, India is making preparations against the COVID-19 outbreak, and avoiding specific crisis actions or not understating its importance will have extremely severe implications.
All the neighboring countries of India have reported positive COVID-19 cases.
To protect against the deadly virus, the Indian government have taken necessary and strict measures, including establishing health check posts between the national borders to test whether people entering the country have the virus.
Different countries have introduced rescue efforts and surveillance measures for citizens wishing to return from China.
The lesson learned from the SARS outbreak was first that the lack of clarity and information about SARS weakened China's global standing and hampered its economic growth.
The outbreak of SARS in China was catastrophic and has led to changes in health care and medical systems (18, 20).
Compared with China, the ability of India to counter a pandemic seems to be much lower.
A recent study reported that affected family members had not visit the Wuhan market in China, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may spread without manifesting symptoms.
Researchers believe that this phenomenon is normal for many viruses.
34 billion—the second largest population in the world—will have difficulty treating severe COVID-19 cases because the country has only 49,000 ventilators, which is a minimal amount.
If the number of COVID-19 cases increases in the nation, it would be a catastrophe for India.
It would be difficult to identify sources of infection and those who come in contact with them.
This would necessitate multiple strategies to handle the outbreak, including computational modeling as well as statistical and quantitative analyses, to rapidly develop new vaccines and drug treatments.
With such a vast population, India's medical system is grossly inadequate.
A study has shown that, owing to inadequate medical care systems, nearly 1 million people die every year in India.
India is also engaged in trading with its nearby countries, such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, Pakistan, Myanmar, China, and Nepal.
During the financial year 2017–18 (FY2017–18), Indian regional trade amounted to nearly $12 billion, accounting for only 1.
56% of its total global trade value of $769 billion.
The outbreak of such viruses and their transmission would significantly affect the Indian economy.
The outbreak in China could profoundly affect the Indian economy, especially in the sectors of electronics, pharmaceuticals, and logistics operations, as trade ports with China are currently closed.
This was further supported by the statement by Suyash Choudhary, Head—Fixed Income, IDFC AMC, stating that GDP might decrease owing to COVID-19 (24).
Economists assume that the impact of COVID-19 on the economy will be high and negative when compared with the SARS impact during 2003.
For instance, it has been estimated that the number of tourists arriving in China was much higher than that of tourists who traveled during the season when SARS emerged in 2003.
This shows that COVID-19 has an effect on the tourism industry.
It has been estimated that, for SARS, there was a 57 and 45% decline in yearly rail passenger and road passenger traffic, respectively.
Moreover, when compared with the world economy 15 years ago, world economies are currently much more inter-related.
It has been estimated that COVID-19 will hurt emerging market currencies and also impact oil prices.
From the retail industry's perspective, consumer savings seem to be high.
This might have an adverse effect on consumption rates, as all supply chains are likely to be affected, which in turn would have its impact on supply when compared with the demand of various necessary product items.
This clearly proves that, based on the estimated losses due to the effect of SARS on tourism (retail sales lost around USD 12–18 billion and USD 30–100 billion was lost at a global macroeconomic level), we cannot estimate the impact of COVID-19 at this point.
This will be possible only when the spread of COVID-19 is fully controlled.
Until that time, any estimates will be rather ambiguous and imprecise.
The OECD Interim economic assessment has provided briefing reports highlighting the role of China in the global supply chain and commodity markets.
Japan, South Korea, and Australia are the countries that are most susceptible to adverse effects, as they have close ties with China.
It has been estimated that there has been a 20% decline in car sales, which was 10% of the monthly decline in China during January 2020.
This shows that even industrial production has been affected by COVID-19.
So far, several factors have thus been identified as having a major economic impact: labor mobility, lack of working hours, interruptions in the global supply chain, less consumption, and tourism, and less demand in the commodity market at a global level, which in turn need to be adequately analyzed by industry type.
Corporate leaders need to prioritize the supply chain and product line economy trends via demand from the consumer end.
Amidst several debates on sustainable economy before the COVID-19 impact, it has now been estimated that India's GDP by the International Monetary Fund has been cut down to 1.9% from 5.8% for the FY21.
The financial crisis that has emerged owing to the worldwide lockdown reflects its adverse effect on several industries and the global supply chain, which has resulted in the GDP dropping to 4.2% for FY20, which was previously estimated at 4.8%.
Nevertheless, it has been roughly estimated that India and China will be experiencing considerable positive growth among other major economies.
Preparations and Preventive Measures in India
An easy way to decrease SARS-CoV-2 infection rates is to avoid virus exposure.
People from India should avoid traveling to countries highly affected with the virus, practice proper hygiene, and avoid consuming food that is not home cooked.
Necessary preventive measures, such as wearing a mask, regular hand washing, and avoiding direct contact with infected persons, should also be practiced.
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), India, has raised awareness about the recent outbreak and taken necessary action to control COVID-19.
Besides, the MOHFW has created a 24 h/7 days-a-week disease alert helpline (+91-11-23978046 and 1800-180-1104) and policy guidelines on surveillance, clinical management, infection prevention and control, sample collection, transportation, and discharging suspected or confirmed cases.
Those who traveled from China, or other countries, and exhibited symptoms, including fever, difficulty in breathing, sore throat, cough, and breathlessness, were asked to visit the nearest hospital for a health check-up.
Officials from seven different airports, including Chennai, Cochin, New Delhi, Kolkata, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru, have been ordered to screen and monitor Indian travelers from China and other affected countries.
In addition, a travel advisory was released to request the cessation of travel to affected countries, and anyone with a travel history that has included China since January 15th, 2020, would be quarantined.
A centralized control room has been set up by the Delhi government at the Directorate General of Health Services, and 11 other districts have done the same.
India has implemented COVID-19 travel advisory for intra- and inter-passenger aircraft restrictions.
More information on additional travel advisory can be accessed with the provided link (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/Traveladvisory.pdf).
India is known for its traditional medicines in the form of AYUSH (Ayurvedic, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy).
The polyherbal powder NilavembuKudineer showed promising effects against dengue and chikungunya fevers in the past.
With the outbreak of COVID-19, the ministry of AYUSH has released a press note “Advisory for Coronavirus,” mentioning useful medications to improve the immunity of the individuals.
Currently, according to the ICMR guidelines, doctors prescribe a combination of Lopinavir and Ritonavir for severe COVID-19 cases and hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In collaboration with the WHO, ICMR will conduct a therapeutic trial for COVID-19 in India.
The ICMR recommends using the US-FDA-approved closed real-time RT-PCR systems, such as GeneXpert and Roche COBAS-6800/8800, which are used to diagnose chronic myeloid leukemia and melanoma, respectively.
In addition, the TruenatTM beta CoV test on the TruelabTM workstation validated by the ICMR is recommended as a screening test.
All positive results obtained on this platform need to be confirmed by confirmatory assays for SARS-CoV-2.
All negative results do not require further testing.
Antibody-based rapid tests were validated at NIV, Pune, and found to be satisfactory;
the rapid test kits are as follows:

As a step further, on the technological aspect, the Union Health Ministry has launched a mobile application called “AarogyaSetu” that works both on android and iOS mobile phones.
This application constructs a user database for establishing an awareness network that can alert people and governments about possible COVID-19 victims.
Future Perspectives
Infections caused by these viruses are an enormous global health threat.
They are a major cause of death and have adverse socio-economic effects that are continually exacerbated.
Therefore, potential treatment initiatives and approaches need to be developed.
First, India is taking necessary preventive measures to reduce viral transmission.
Second, ICMR and the Ministry of AYUSH provided guidelines to use conventional preventive and treatment strategies to increase immunity against COVID-19.
These guidelines could help reduce the severity of the viral infection in elderly patients and increase life expectancy.
The recent report from the director of ICMR mentioned that India would undergo randomized controlled trials using convalescent plasma of completely recovered COVID-19 patients.
Convalescent plasma therapy is highly recommended, as it has provided moderate success with SARS and MERS; this has been rolled out in 20 health centers and will be increased this month (May 2020).
India has expertise in specialized medical/pharmaceutical industries with production facilities, and the government has established fast-tracking research to develop rapid diagnostic test kits and vaccines at low cost.
In addition, the Serum Institute of India started developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Until we obtain an appropriate vaccine, it is highly recommended that we screen the red zoned areas to stop further transmission of the virus.
Medical college doctors in Kerala, India, implemented the low-cost WISK (Walk-in Sample Kiosk) to collect samples without direct exposure or contact.
After Kerala, The Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) developed walk-in kiosks to collect COVID-19 samples and named these as COVID-19 Sample Collection Kiosk (COVSACK).
After the swab collection, the testing of SARS-CoV-2 can be achieved with the existing diagnostic facility in India.
This facility can be used for massive screening or at least in the red zoned areas without the need for personal protective equipment kits.
India has attempted to broaden its research facilities and shift toward testing the mass population, as recommended by medical experts in India and worldwide.
NEW VACCINE TECHNOLOGY COULD BE APPLIED TO OTHER DISEASES
The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines – such as the Pfizer and Moderna ones – were the culmination of years of work in developing mRNA technology.
Essentially, they work as plug-and-play vaccines: the mRNA that codes for the pathogenic protein can be swapped out for another, depending on the disease.
This means they could be used for next-gen flu vaccines, especially since influenza viruses evolve constantly.
Using vaccines that could be updated easily would be a huge advantage, helping us to stay ahead of the strains that are circulating.
The pandemic has made clear that health systems need to be not just robust but resilient in terms of responding to and recovering from a crisis.
There is also research underway to test whether mRNA vaccines could be used against cancer, although this is more complicated than protecting against a disease caused by a virus or bacterium.
BRINGING HEALTHCARE TO THE PEOPLE
Pre-pandemic, the promise of telemedicine and e-health had been discussed for years without much investment or commitment to making it a reality on a wide scale.
As health systems became overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases, and as mobility restrictions made it challenging for many people to travel to health centres, virtual consultations became the norm.
Improvements in digital connectivity such as cheaper and better systems of teleconferencing could make remote learning a reality for health workers in low- and middle-income countries, especially in remote areas.
MORE COMMUNITY-BASED HEALTHCARE
Community health workers have been a mainstay in many low- and middle-income countries, working quietly as a bridge between the health system and communities to build trust, act as advocates and educators, as well as provide outreach.
Have you read?
How likely is a positive COVID-19 lateral flow test to be wrong?
Is it safe to mix and match COVID-19 vaccines?
Can we stop wearing masks after being vaccinated?
During the pandemic, community workers have been especially valuable in communities that have been the hardest hit but most skeptical about vaccines, such as African American and Hispanic communities in the United States.
Now that their role has been shown to be indispensable, countries where healthcare has become more individualised and less community-based could return to a community-led form of healthcare.
BETTER SURVEILLANCE NETWORKS FOR EMERGENCIES
Much of COVID-19 surveillance relied on the existing global influenza surveillance network that surged at the start of the pandemic to respond to the crisis.
This shows clearly the advantage in having a robust surveillance system set up that can be adapted to different infectious diseases, especially across Asia, Africa and Latin America, where setting up new systems in a time of crisis can be challenging.
BOOSTING NATIONAL CAPACITY TO MAKE VACCINES AND DRUGS
Supply bottlenecks in getting vaccines to countries across Africa have shown how countries need to re-examine their supply chains and develop the capacity to produce vaccines, drugs and medical supplies locally.
In April this year, the African Union launched the Partnership for African Vaccine Manufacturing to boost manufacturing capacity across the continent, which would include strengthening regulatory systems, raising the profile of African universities as R&D hubs and increasing technology transfer.
A month later, the EU announced it will invest €1 billion in building vaccine production hubs in Africa to support this move.
DEVELOPING MORE RESILIENT HEALTH SYSTEMS
The pandemic has made clear that health systems need to be not just robust but resilient in responding to and recovering from a crisis.
This means being agile enough to adapt to a new way of operating through virtual medical consultations, deploying community health workers, or re-assigning health workers to focus on the crisis.
Many countries in Africa and Asia responded well on these measures, including in providing mental health support to their health workers.
CLOSER PUBLIC-PRIVATE COLLABORATION
The all-hands-on-deck approach needed for a pandemic like COVID-19 meant that the public and private sectors had to join forces in ways never seen before.
Private hospitals made beds and resources available to public facilities and the private sector was mobilised to support the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines worldwide right from manufacture and procurement to storage and distribution.
In Ghana, for example, Zipline and UPS are using drones to deliver vaccines to health facilities.
This utilisation of private sector expertise and resources to tackle disease is something we could well see more of.
A cocktail of manmade antibodies that prevents coronavirus from infecting new cells reduces the risk of death among patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 who have failed to mount a natural antibody response of their own.
The antibody therapy, produced by US company Regeneron, is the third drug, after dexamethasone and tocilizumab, shown to help people infected with COVID-19 to recover.
Although the discovery of another drug that can reduce COVID-associated deaths is good news, its high price and limited manufacturing capability will put it beyond the reach of most low- and middle-income countries, not to mention low-income populations in wealthier countries, prompting calls for more equitable access.
The evidence also suggests it will reduce the risk of death by a fifth and only in seronegative patients, meaning that the treatment may be restricted to priority groups.
"The absolute magnitude of benefit in mortality is not large, and it means that a large number of people have to be treated with the extremely expensive drug for a single death to be prevented," said Stephen Evans, Professor of Pharmacoepidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.
“The calls for cheaper vaccines might be repeated for these drugs, which are essentially only available in very rich countries,” he added.
ANTIBODY THERAPY
Regeneron’s drug, called Regen-Cov, consists of two man-made proteins called monoclonal antibodies that act like the natural antibodies found in the immune system.
They bind to non-overlapping parts of SARS-CoV-2's spike protein in the critical region it uses to latch onto human cells, preventing new viral particles from infecting further cells.
The combination of two antibodies, rather than one, reduces the likelihood of viral variants emerging that can resist treatment.
A previous study in non-hospitalised COVID-19 patients suggested that Regen-Cov could reduce viral load, shorten the duration of illness, and reduce the risk of hospitalisation or death.
However, this is the first trial large enough to definitively determine whether it reduces deaths in patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19.
The studies started by comparing antibodies against the spike protein from mice and patients who had recovered from COVID-19.
LIFESAVING TREATMENT
The RECOVERY trial, led by the University of Oxford, UK, is the world’s largest trial assessing the ability of various therapeutics to benefit patients hospitalised with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
A year ago, it found that dexamethasone – a low cost and widely available drug – could save patients’ lives.
Why do antibodies fade after a COVID-19 infection, and will the same thing happen with vaccines?
COVID-19 antibody levels could fall faster in men than women
You’ve got your antibody test result – but what does it mean?
The new trial involved 9,785 patients who were randomly allocated to receive either usual hospital care (either dexamethasone or tocilizumab), or usual care in combination with the antibody treatment.
Of these patients, about a third were “seronegative” at the start of the trial, meaning that they had not developed a natural antibody response of their own against the virus.
Such patients are twice as likely to die compared to “seropositive” patients who have produced an antibody response, even though some of them still become seriously ill.
The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, found that Regeneron’s treatment reduced the risk of death among seronegative patients by a fifth, meaning that for every 100 people treated, there would be six fewer deaths.
Their hospital stay was also reduced by around four days, on average (median 13 days, compared to 17 days for the usual care group), and they were less likely to progress to needing mechanical ventilation to help them breathe.
However, there was no significant benefit for patients who had mounted their own antibody response.
“It is wonderful to learn that even in advanced COVID-19 disease, targeting the virus can reduce mortality in patients who have failed to mount an antibody response of their own,” said Sir Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the University of Oxford, who co-led the trial.
However, he said that more must be done to make such drugs accessible, including scaling up manufacturing, and reducing the price.
Regen-Cov currently costs around £1000 or £2000 per treatment, and has emergency authorisation for use in America, Brazil, Canada, the European Union and India.
It remains an investigational drug, meaning that it can only be used in clinical trials, elsewhere.
EQUITABLE ACCESS
More than 70 monoclonal antibodies are currently in development for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, but this isn’t their only use.
In September, a report by the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and Wellcome, an independent global health foundation, highlighted the potentially transformative impact of such drugs for many existing and emerging infectious and neglected diseases, including Ebola and HIV.
However, despite 85% of the world’s population living in low- and middle-income countries, currently, 80% of the sales of monoclonal antibodies are in the US, Canada, and Europe.
“This market imbalance represents a huge gap in access, one that is likely to grow as new monoclonal antibodies are poised to enter the market,” the report said.
“As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, no country is immune to the threat posed by emerging infectious diseases.
“If monoclonal antibodies prove to be effective for COVID-19, ensuring prompt, equitable and affordable global access to these products, as well as others, will be imperative.
Having the correct quality of hospital care to safely administer the intravenous drugs at scale will also be an important barrier to overcome.
Regeneron and Roche (the pharmaceutical company responsible for development and distribution of Regen-Cov outside the US) say they are collaborating to increase its global supply.
The question of how to reopen our societies in the wake of the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus poses special questions for social researchers, beyond those of the immediate and difficult task at hand.
For scholars, the question is not only, what is society to become after the Covid-19 pandemic?
But how do the social conditions exposed, exacerbated, and created by the novel coronavirus demand that we substantively rethink our ideas of society and, therefore, some of the prevailing assumptions, methods, and theories of social science?
The Covid-19 crisis has disrupted the normal practice of economy and governance, and scientific expertise.
In recent weeks we have experienced a global economic crisis that was unexpected; because the speed and scope of this downturn lacks historical precedent, its impact cannot be readily modeled using the standard social science methods.
In the realm of political economy, we see market transitions without historical precedent, such that they become impossible to model reliably, even as new and unexpected informal economies are emerging.
“The tested facts and hard evidence emerging out of scholarship that were once relied upon as a ballast during times of social disorientation are now subject to ideological litmus tests or ignored.
In the United States, the pandemic response is realigning (again) the respective roles and responsibilities of state and federal governments, against a backdrop of a reshuffled global political order, as scholars reckon with the decline of globalization (and the persistence of asymmetrical national interdependence1).
The tested facts and hard evidence emerging out of scholarship that were once relied upon as a ballast during times of social disorientation are now subject to ideological litmus tests or ignored.
In addition to introducing new dynamics, the pandemic has confirmed what scholars have known about social inequality and compounded the intersecting forces of race, class, and gender on disparate life chances.
The disproportionate, life-threatening impact of the novel coronavirus on Black communities across the United States, for example, is a symptom of the wider, deeper social pandemic of structural inequality.
Social scientists have long known that socioeconomic opportunity, employment sector, incarceration and detention status, housing insecurity, and educational access have everything to do with health and wellbeing.
What should be our prevailing theory of society after pandemic intervention breaks what we thought we knew about economy, governance, and expertise, and confirms what we know, but failed to address about social inequality?
How can we continue to invest in projects that sustain the description of gross inequality without offering prescriptions for change?
Social research can provide theories, evidence, and viable alternatives to this impoverished status quo.
As economist Darrick Hamilton notes in his brief interview about the future of social research on SSRC’s Covid-19 platform, “[t]here’s a need for a call to arms for us to apply our scholarship.
There’s no impediment to drawing a link between research and policy beyond the fact that we don’t do it.
“How do we reimagine the human sciences with human flourishing at the center?
The social sciences have a role to play in helping to scaffold the new forms of social solidarity that are being called for in this moment.
One model comes from the work of sociologist Eric Klinenberg who draws on his “social autopsy” approach,2 and now decades of singular scholarship, to demonstrate the need for the cultivation of “social infrastructure.
But a notion of shared humanity is a precondition for the common good on which social solidarity necessarily rests.
Or as Zygmunt Bauman reminds us, any “moral instinct… to be found in human conduct is socially produced.
It dissolves once the society malfunctions.
3 With so much about society at stake, there may be an opening for the human sciences to be more humane in their aims and ambitions.
How do we reimagine the human sciences with human flourishing at the center?
To take up the now common language of reopening in a different way, this moment affords an opportunity to consider what social research has gotten wrong and to enact new practices around what we know about all too well.
This opening is also an opportunity to pose questions about the conditions of our work as scholars.
As we ask what kind of society we want after this pandemic wave crests, inherent in this question for scholars is the type of robust social research we will need to both apprehend and construct these renewed social communities.
The multifaceted effects of the Covid-19 pandemic are and will be staggering.
We are in the midst of a social tumult that will have a far-reaching impact.
“Unprecedented” has been used to describe the contagion rate and tenacity of Covid-19.
“Unprecedented” also embodies the new global public created around this once-in-a-lifetime common experience.
In education and research, we are creating new social modalities as we live them—”building the ship as we sail it,” as an SSRC colleague of mine often says.
More practically, how do we do social research at a time when, for the foreseeable future, borders are closing, global cooperation is yielding to widespread mistrust, and necessary public health accommodations such as “social distancing” create hurdles for both human connection and research?
While there are certainly digital and other means for accomplishing our work, what does it mean to do video interviews in a time of “deep fakes”?
How do we account for the information that might be lost when physical contact is not possible, the inability to see gestures like toes tapping and nervous hands, the “intersubjective encounter”?
4 And as historian Lara Putnam reminded us at an SSRC convening in the fall, although the form of digital research may present new opportunities, such as ready access to distant archives, what latent knowledge gleaned from the tactile nature of the archive may be lost in the process?
Education as a workplace and research as a labor practice are also being transformed.
We are simultaneously experiencing a rapid transition in processes central to knowledge production—including office hours, lab convenings, graduate school seminars, and professional conferences—now taking place virtually.
Without the benefit (or luxury) of strategy or fine-tuning or near-term assessment, the cycles and rituals of research and education—including examinations, commencement, peer-review, and the pace of and audience for scholarly publications—are being extensively reimagined.
“This moment is an opportunity to envision the education universe anew and to prioritize a culture of teaching, learning, and knowing that is equitable, collaborative, ethical and accessible.
How are the concerns about the “future of work,” workplace surveillance, and privacy now an integral part of the research enterprise for both faculty and students?
How will public and private institutions mitigate the disparities inherent to the move to virtual teaching and research engagement?
A large, insecure teaching labor force is undergoing real-time re-skilling without compensation; a digital divide is stubbornly in place, with net neutrality unevenly distributed globally; and the density and security of living arrangements as well as caregiving responsibilities make learning or teaching or conducting research at home a new frontier of disparity.
With these issues brought into stark relief, this moment is an opportunity to envision the education universe anew and to prioritize a culture of teaching, learning, and knowing that is equitable, collaborative, ethical and accessible.
Even as bans on travel may stoke xenophobia, nationalizing the universal quest for knowledge, solidarity, and mutual aid are being reinvigorated.
Educational institutions are meeting the moment: dormitories becoming hospitals; public health and policy schools turning over their research enterprise to Covid-19 response; faculty writing in the public sphere to increase public understanding of this time.
This “fourth purpose” (to use Columbia University President Lee Bollinger’s phrasing) of education and research will be taken up wholesale.
This is a moment to rededicate ourselves to what education enables: the advancement of research and knowledge across boundaries of geography and convention.
Because Covid-19 is a matter of human behavior and social interaction, as much as one of public health and immunology, we at the Social Science Research Council are putting in place a set of initiatives that critically examine “social distancing” as a new modality of social life carrying with it both benefits and downsides.
In addition, we are pressing forward with an “anticipatory social research” agenda that draws from the wellspring of what we know, while endeavoring to create frameworks to apprehend the certainty of unexpected phenomena on the horizon.
Today, the Social Science Research Council launches a series of initiatives that propose answers to the question, what is society after the coronavirus pandemic?
We envision this scholarly endeavor to be as enduring as the long-term effects of this crisis.
In the weeks and months to come, the Council hopes to catalyze new work on the social, political, economic, and psychological disruptions resulting from the coronavirus crisis.
The SSRC Covid-19 platform will be a “virtual research center” for thinking about the impact of the novel coronavirus, as well as considering what this impact means for the questions and methods advanced by social science today.
We have assembled prior SSRC essay collections of the last two decades on the social implications of Hurricane Katrina, September 11, and extreme climate.
Each of these instances are specific and particular.
But placing scholars’ reflections and analyses side by side reveals the chronic nature of human vulnerability and the increasing incidence of disaster and disease that lie at the intersection of environment, culture, and politics.
In years prior, the Council archived these essay collections after some time because the moment had passed.
No longer.
These issues will never be behind us.
We will never be beyond them.
Covid-19 is a kind of social kaleidoscope refracting social phenomena, reassembling them in new and familiar formations—and with unfamiliar vividness.
“This is a time for creating knowledge pathways to a better world.
What Bauman wrote critically about sociology might be extended to all social research: it “has been engaged… in a mimetic relationship with its object—or, rather, with the imagery of that object which it constructed and accepted as the frame for its own discourse.
5 In light of changes in society we must also change social research from being mimetic of society to being consciously dialogic with the world it seeks to apprehend and improve.
This is a time for creating knowledge pathways to a better world.
The Covid-19 pandemic has arguably resulted in the most severe global economic crisis since the Great Depression of 1929, which changed the structure of the global economy.
1 For Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country and one of its two largest economies, the pandemic has made a bad economic situation worse.
Nigeria was already experiencing a severe economic crisis prior to the outbreak of the pandemic.
Elements of the crisis included mounting public debt, a high unemployment rate, declining oil export earnings, and currency depreciation, among others.
The pandemic has exacerbated the situation of a country already in dire economic straits.
Firstly, the decline in global economic activities at the peak of the pandemic contributed to a sharp drop in the price of crude oil, Nigeria’s major export commodity, which accounts for 96 percent of total foreign exchange earnings and 60 percent of government revenue.
One estimate notes that Nigeria foreign earnings declined by 60 percent in the six months leading to the end of the third quarter of 2020.
Secondly, the low export earnings also contributed to foreign exchange scarcity and the sharp currency depreciation of the local currency, the Naira, which has lost 30 percent of its value relative to the US dollar in the last six months.
Third, there has been a rapid decline in government revenues due to the restriction of economic activities by 60 percent.
Fourth, inflation has been increasing for the past few months; the average inflation rate was 13.
7 percent in September 2020, while it was 16.
66 percent for food items during the same period, the highest in 30 months.
Rising food prices caused by a weakened Naira and poor crop harvests have made things difficult for ordinary people, while limited access to other basic goods due to high prices have made a bad situation worse for the poor.
Finally, the initial attempt by government to enforce a prolonged lockdown and social distancing measures to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus also caused severe economic pain for the poor and informal sector workers who rely on daily incomes to survive and mostly live in crowded conditions that render any form of distancing impracticable.
The Reforms: Don’t Waste a Crisis
It was Rahm Emanuel, the chief of staff to former US President Barack Obama who, in his contribution to the discussion on the Covid-19 outbreak, noted: “Never allow a good crisis go to waste.
It’s an opportunity to do the things you once thought were impossible.
This is exactly what the Nigerian government did by taking advantage of the opportunity provided by the pandemic to introduce some long overdue economic reforms.
These reforms included the removal of subsidies from refined petroleum products and electricity, exchange rates convergence, and sustainable debt management policies.
The introduction of these reforms were challenging for two reasons.
The first was the ideological opposition they faced even within the government and among some elites who considered them part of the neoliberal policy imposed by the Bretton Woods institutions.
In response, the government defended the decision by arguing that removing the subsidies is the only way to conserve resources to meet its financial obligations, run an efficient downstream oil sector, and put an end to misallocation of resources toward meeting bogus subsidy claims.
The second was the widespread opposition from Nigerian citizens and sections of civil society who genuinely believe that the payment of (fuel) subsidies is the only benefit they receive from the Nigerian state.
Therefore, every attempt by successive governments over the years to remove the so-called fuel subsidies have been strongly resisted by the Nigerian people.
However, due to the inability of government to meet the current subsidy payment obligations, it had only one option, which was to remove the subsidies.
It did so, and although there were no street protests, the discontent among long-suffering Nigerians has been palpable.
The removal of the subsidy on petroleum products remains the boldest fiscal reform the Buhari administration has undertaken since its first term in 2015.
There are two reasons for this action: First, the payments of oil subsidies, smuggling of oil products to neighbouring countries, and the attendant corruption embedded in the importation of refined petroleum products had become a massive drain on government finances and revenues, costing an estimated NGN 8.
9 trillion (USD 23 billion) in the last ten years.
The Nigerian government is expected to save USD 2.
6 billion annually from the removal of the petroleum subsidy.
This money could be used to finance massive social and infrastructural spending.
Secondly, subsidy payments had been riddled by massive corruption involving government cronies who benefited from inflated subsidy claims.
A counterargument by people opposed to the policy, however, is that subsidy removal seems like a never-ending charade and that the promises of infrastructural development made in previous years were never kept.
Also, the partially privatized electricity sector had been a drain on government finances due to subsidy payments to both distribution and generation firms to keep the price of electricity below market price.
The scarcity of foreign exchange also forced the government to resort to exchange rates convergence through the merger of numerous exchange rates.
The decision by the government to adopt exchange rate convergence is to discourage round-tripping, a situation wherein privileged Nigerians buy foreign currencies at lower official rates and sell them at higher rates at the parallel foreign exchange or black markets for profit.
Although multiple exchange rates still exist, there are not as many as there were before the pandemic.
Economic Response: Stimulus, Cash Transfer, and Socioeconomic Palliatives
The Nigerian government responded to the economic crisis that was worsened by the pandemic by using diverse policies and tools.
On March 23, 2020, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced a stimulus package of NGN 50 billion (USD 151 million) for household and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to mitigate the effects of Covid-19 on small businesses and households.
A day later, on March 24, the National Assembly passed the Emergency Economic Stimulus Bill that granted a 50 percent tax break for registered firms with the aim of helping them improve their financial situation when the economy restarts.
A key weakness of the stimilus bill, however, is that most small firms in Nigeria are in the informal sector and are therefore not registered and unable to access the funds.
On April 1, the Nigerian federal government annouced the continuation of the conditional cash transfer scheme that transfers NGN 20,000 (USD 52) to each poor household registered on the National Social Register (NSR) on a quarterly basis, as more states issued lockdown orders on April 2 following the spread of Covid-19 to other parts of Nigeria.
On April 6, the federal government reached out to various international and multilateral financial institutions to raise USD 6.
9 billion in credit to help reverse the adverse economic consequences of the pandemic.
The most ambitious of all the economic responses by the Nigerian governmmet to the pandemic has been the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP), a stimulus package of NGN 2.
3 trillion (USD 2 billion) with the objectives of boosting local production, preventing firms from collapsing, and providing liquidity for businesses, especially informal microenterprises.
16 An important aspect of the ESP is the Survival Fund, which was specifically set up to provide payroll support, take-off grants, and unconditional grants for small firms in the informal sector of the economy.
Also, different levels of government and the private sector made efforts to provide food items as socioeconomic palliatives for the people most affected by the loss of incomes or livelihoods as a result of the pandemic.
The Pains and the People
Socioeconomically vulnerable groups of Nigerian people have suffered immensely at the hands of various governments.
Their suffering and pain are largely the consequences of socially harsh economic reforms introduced by government and the adverse impact of policies aimed at curbing the Covid-19 pandemic.
Also, some people caught violating the lockdown rules have suffered at the hands of law enforcement agents, some with fatal consequences.
The removal of subsidies on petroleum products also culminated a 10 percent increase in the prices of consumer products, with a multiplier effect on the costs and prices of everyday items such as transportation, user fees, public utilities, and staple foods.
Also, the depreciation of the local currency by about 30 percent has contributed to increases in the prices of imported goods and raw materials for local manufacturers.
The economy has also contracted by 6.
1 percent during the first second quarter of the year, while inflation remains at 13 percent.
The implications of all these negative economic indicators are that more Nigerians are becoming impoverished and unemployed, as well as increasingly marginalized and angry.
It is noted that the risk of social unrest will continue to remain very high if the trend is not reversed.
More effort needs to be put into ensuring that the social benefits of economic reforms in the time of Covid-19 trump the pains suffered by the majority of the people.
Preventing the spread of the coronavirus
May 17, 2021
Physical distancing, masks, vaccines, and other preventive measures
You've gotten the basics down: you're wearing your mask when you need to, avoiding crowds, and keeping your distance.
But you likely still have questions.
Does wearing a mask protect you, others, or both?
How exactly will physical distancing help?
And what do you need to know about the new COVID-19 vaccines?
Visit our Coronavirus Resource Center for more information on coronavirus and COVID-19.
What can I do to protect myself and others from COVID-19?
The following actions help prevent the spread of COVID-19, as well as other coronaviruses and influenza.
If you are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19:
Wear a face mask, as advised by the CDC.
Maintain at least six feet of distance between yourself and others.
Avoid large gatherings.
Socialize outdoors.
Get vaccinated as soon as you are eligible.
Everyone:
Minimize touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.
Stay home when you are sick.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
Clean frequently touched objects and surfaces regularly.
Wash your hands often with soap and water.
This chart illustrates how protective measures such as limiting travel, avoiding crowds, social distancing, and thorough and frequent handwashing can slow down the development of new COVID-19 cases and reduce the risk of overwhelming the health care system.
What outdoor and indoor activities are considered safe?
Does it matter if I’ve been vaccinated?
And do I still need to wear a mask?
According to new guidance from the CDC, fully vaccinated people can now participate in all indoor and outdoor activities without a mask and without physical distancing.
For people who are not fully vaccinated, the CDC continues to recommend mask wearing and other preventive measures in some outdoor settings and in most indoor settings.
If you have a weakened immune system due to a medical condition or to medications you are taking, you may be less protected by the vaccine and thus at increased risk when you are around others who have not been vaccinated.
Talk to your doctor to find out what safety measures you should continue to take.
Whether you’re vaccinated or not, you’ll need to follow federal, state, tribal, and local laws, and workplace or business requirements around mask wearing and physical distancing.
The CDC has created a helpful chart illustrating the protection vaccination provides in all outdoor and indoor activities, and what prevention measures you still need to take if you are not vaccinated.
To view the chart, click here.
What do I need to know about washing my hands effectively?
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; and after handling anything that's come from outside your home.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands and rubbing them together until they feel dry.
Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
The CDC's handwashing website has detailed instructions and a video about effective handwashing procedures.
How does coronavirus spread?
The coronavirus spreads mainly from person to person.
A person infected with coronavirus — even one with no symptoms — may emit aerosols when they talk or breathe.
Aerosols are infectious viral particles that can float or drift around in the air for up to three hours.
Another person can breathe in these aerosols and become infected with the coronavirus.
This can happen between people who are in close contact with one another.
Droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes may land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby, or possibly be inhaled into their lungs.
Transmission is less likely to happen outdoors, where air currents scatter and dilute the virus, than in a home, office, or other confined space with limited air circulation.
Even outdoors, people who are not fully vaccinated should follow CDC guidance on masking and physical distancing, to reduce risk even further.
The risk of spread from contact with contaminated surfaces or objects is considered to be extremely low.
According to the CDC, each contact with a contaminated surface has less than a 1 in 10,000 chance of causing an infection.
The virus may be shed in saliva, semen, and feces; whether it is shed in vaginal fluids isn't known.
Kissing can transmit the virus.
Transmission of the virus through feces, or during vaginal or anal intercourse or oral sex, appears to be extremely unlikely at this time.
How could contact tracing help slow the spread of COVID-19?
Anyone who comes into close contact with someone who has COVID-19 is at increased risk of becoming infected themselves, and of potentially infecting others.
Contact tracing can help prevent further transmission of the virus by quickly identifying and informing people who may be infected and contagious, so they can take steps to not infect others.
Contact tracing begins with identifying everyone that a person recently diagnosed with COVID-19 has been in contact with since they became contagious.
In the case of COVID-19, a person may be contagious 48 to 72 hours before they started to experience symptoms.
The contacts are notified about their exposure.
They may be told what symptoms to look out for, advised to isolate themselves for a period of time, and to seek medical attention as needed if they start to experience symptoms.
What is physical distancing and why is it important?
The COVID-19 virus primarily spreads when one person breathes in droplets or aerosols that are produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes.
Physical distancing refers to actions taken to stop or slow down the spread of a contagious disease.
For an individual, it refers to maintaining enough distance (6 feet or more) between yourself and another person to avoid getting infected or infecting someone else.
Directives to work from home, and cancelling meetings and larger events help enforce physical distancing at a community level.
What does the CDC's new definition of "close contacts" mean for me?
The CDC has expanded how it defines close contacts of someone with COVID-19.
Until this point, the CDC had defined a close contact as someone who spent 15 or more consecutive minutes within six feet of someone with COVID-19.
According to the new definition, a close contact is someone who spends 15 minutes or more within six feet of a person with COVID-19 over a period of 24 hours.
Close contacts are at increased risk of infection.
When a person tests positive for COVID-19, contact tracers may identify their close contacts and urge them to quarantine to prevent further spread.
Based on the new definition, more people will now be considered close contacts.
Many factors can affect the chances that infection will spread from one person to another.
These factors include whether or one or both people are wearing masks, whether the infected person is coughing or showing other symptoms, and whether the encounter occurred indoors or outdoors.
Though the "15 minutes within six feet rule" is a helpful guideline, it's always best to minimize close interactions with people who are not members of your household.
The CDC's new definition was influenced by a case described in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in which a correctional officer in Vermont is believed to have been infected after being within six feet for 17 non-consecutive minutes of six asymptomatic individuals, all of whom later tested positive for COVID-19.
What types of medications and health supplies should I have on hand for an extended stay at home?
Try to stock at least a 30-day supply of any needed prescriptions.
If your insurance permits 90-day refills, that's even better.
Make sure you also have over-the-counter medications and other health supplies on hand.
Medical and health supplies:
prescription medications
prescribed medical supplies such as glucose and blood-pressure monitoring equipment
fever and pain medicine, such as acetaminophen
cough and cold medicines
antidiarrheal medication
thermometer
fluids with electrolytes
soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizer
tissues, toilet paper, disposable diapers, tampons, sanitary napkins
garbage bags.
What precautions can I take when grocery shopping?
The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through droplets containing virus, or through viral particles that float in the air.
The virus may be breathed in directly and can also spread when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touches their mouth, nose, or eyes.
There is no current evidence that the COVID-19 virus is transmitted through food.
Safety precautions help you avoid breathing in coronavirus or touching a contaminated surface and touching your face.
In the grocery store, maintain at least six feet of distance between yourself and other shoppers.
Wipe frequently touched surfaces like grocery carts or basket handles with disinfectant wipes.
Wearing a cloth mask helps remind you not to touch your face and can further help reduce spread of the virus.
Use hand sanitizer before leaving the store.
Wash your hands as soon as you get home.
If you are older than 65 or at increased risk for any reason, and you have not yet been vaccinated, limit trips to the grocery store.
Ask a neighbor or friend to pick up groceries and leave them outside your house.
See if your grocery store offers special hours for older adults or those with underlying conditions.
Or have groceries delivered to your home.
Which precautions are still necessary if you have not been fully immunized with the COVID-19 vaccine?
Wear masks as advised by the CDC.
Physically distance.
Wash your hands frequently.
If you are not fully vaccinated, these are essential precautions you should take to reduce your risk of catching or spreading coronavirus.
But what about some other precautions you may be taking?
Do they help, or is it okay to let them go?
Let's take a look.
You don't need to wear gloves when running errands.
It's true that a person can get infected if they touch a surface or object that has viral particles on it, then touch their mouth, nose, or eyes.
But this is not the main way the virus spreads.
What's more, gloves won't prevent this type of transmission, and may even make it more likely that you will touch your face.
Instead, wash your hands before you leave the house, use hand sanitizer when you're out and about, and wash your hands again when you get back home.
In between, try to avoid touching your face.
You don't need to disinfect groceries or takeout containers.
The risk of infection from food or food packaging is very small.
The CDC advises against using disinfectant intended for hard surfaces on cardboard or other grocery items, which can absorb the chemicals.
If you are concerned about takeout, transfer food to your own serving dishes.
And wash your hands and disinfect your counters after putting away your groceries or handling takeout containers.
Your mail can come out of quarantine.
Mail does not pose a large risk, and putting your mail aside for several days before opening it is unnecessary.
Once again, your best bet is to wash your hands after handling anything you bring in from outside.
You can invite your cleaners back into your home.
If your cleaners are not fully vaccinated, request that they wear masks the entire time they are in your home.
If you are not fully vaccinated, leave the house while the cleaners are present if you can; otherwise, move to a different part of the house and close the door.
Open windows to increase airflow throughout the house.
It's okay to go for a swim.
Pools are relatively safe, because the coronavirus doesn't spread through water and chlorine is a disinfectant.
If you are not vaccinated, try to maintain physical distancing in crowded pools, but don't wear cloth masks in the water: they are difficult to breathe through when wet.
Do wear a mask when changing if you are not vaccinated, and minimize time in changing rooms, which are often crowded and not well ventilated.
What can I do when social distancing?
Try to look at this period of social distancing as an opportunity to get to things you've been meaning to do.
Though you might be avoiding the gym right now, that doesn't mean you can't exercise.
Take long walks or run outside (do your best to maintain at least six feet between you and non-family members when you're outside).
Do some yoga or other indoor exercise routines when the weather isn't cooperating.
Kids need exercise too, so try to get them outside every day for walks or a backyard family soccer game (remember, this isn't the time to invite the neighborhood kids over to play).
Pull out board games that are gathering dust on your shelves.
Have family movie nights.
Catch up on books you've been meaning to read, or do a family read-aloud every evening.
It's important to stay connected even though we should not do so in person.
Keep in touch virtually through phone calls, Skype, Zoom, video, and other social media.
Enjoy a leisurely chat with an old friend you've been meaning to call.
If all else fails, go to bed early and get some extra sleep!
The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through viral particles that float in the air or through droplets containing virus.
Even people who are infected but do not have symptoms, or have not yet developed symptoms, can infect others.
Masks help minimize spread, which is why the CDC has long advised mask wearing, in addition to physical distancing.
But in May 2021, the CDC revised their guidance about mask wearing, tailoring their advice depending on a person's vaccination status, along with the nature and location of the activity.
There are a couple of reasons for this.
First, we've learned that transmission is much less likely to occur outdoors, where air currents are more likely to scatter and dilute the virus.
In addition, more and more people have been vaccinated.
Those who are vaccinated are not only protecting themselves from infection, they also appear less likely to infect others.
According to the new CDC guidance, fully vaccinated people can now participate in all indoor and outdoor activities without a mask and without physical distancing.
For people who are not fully vaccinated, the CDC continues to recommend mask wearing and other preventive measures in some outdoors settings and in most indoor settings.
The CDC has created a helpful chart illustrating the protection vaccination provides in all outdoor and indoor activities and what prevention measures you still need to take if you are not vaccinated.
What kind of mask should you wear?
The CDC recommends masks made of two or more layers of washable, breathable fabric.
Surgical masks are also effective.
Make sure the mask completely covers your nose and mouth and fits snugly against the sides of your face without leaving any gaps.
While N95 masks are the most effective, these medical-grade masks should be reserved for healthcare workers.
Surgical masks are preferred if you are caring for someone who has COVID-19.
The CDC has information on how to make, wear, and clean nonsurgical masks.
The WHO offers videos and illustrations on when and how to use a mask.
Lately I’ve seen more people wearing two masks.
Should I be double masking?
In situations where you need to wear a mask, double masking is still a good idea.
A lab study published in MMWR observed masked and unmasked dummies that released aerosol particles from a mouthpiece when they were simulated to cough or breathe.
The study found that wearing a multilayered cloth mask over a surgical mask or wearing a tightly fitted surgical mask substantially increased the level of protection for both the mask wearer and others.
When double masking, the CDC recommends wearing a snug cloth mask over a surgical mask.
Surgical masks provide better filtration, but tend to fit loosely.
Cloth masks close any gaps and provide another layer of protection.
Surgical masks are sometimes called medical masks or medical procedure masks.
Adjusting a surgical mask for a tighter fit using a method called "knotting and tucking" also offers good protection.
To knot and tuck a surgical mask, knot the ear loops of a 3-ply face mask where they join the edge of the mask, then fold and tuck the unneeded material under the edges.
For video instructions on how to knot and tuck a surgical mask, click here.
Mask fitters, or mask braces, which are worn over a cloth or surgical mask, can also improve mask fit.
In the CDC's lab study, double masking or tight-fitting surgical masks reduced both transmission of and exposure to aerosols by about 95% compared to no masking.
What types of masks are most and least effective?
We know that wearing masks can help prevent the spread of coronavirus by blocking droplets that are emitted when someone coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes.
But which masks are best and worst?
Researchers at Duke University created a simple setup that allowed them to count the number of droplet particles released when people spoke the phrase "Stay healthy, people" five times in a row.
First, the study participants spoke without a mask, and then they repeated the same words, each time wearing one of 14 different types of face masks and coverings.
As expected, medical grade N95 masks performed best, meaning that the fewest number of droplets got through.
They were followed by surgical masks.
Several masks made of polypropylene, a cotton/propylene blend, and 2-layer cotton masks sewn in different styles also performed well.
Gaiters ranked dead last.
Also called neck fleeces, gaiters tend to be made of lightweight fabric and are often worn by athletes.
Bandanas also ranked poorly.
A couple of simple tests can help you gauge the effectiveness of your mask: If you can see through your mask when you hold it up to the light, or can breathe through it easily, it's probably not doing much to prevent spread.
Who do masks protect: the wearer, others, or both?
We've known for some time that masks help prevent people from spreading the coronavirus to others.
Based on an analysis of existing information, a new study contends that masks may also protect mask wearers from becoming infected themselves.
Different masks, writes the study author, block viral particles to varying degrees.
If masks lead to lower "doses" of virus being inhaled, then fewer people may become infected, and those who do may have milder illness.
Researchers in China experimented with hamsters to test the effect of masks.
They put healthy hamsters and hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 coronavirus) in a cage, and separated some of the healthy and infected hamsters with a barrier made of surgical masks.
Many of the "masked" healthy hamsters did not get infected, and those who did got less sick than previously healthy "maskless" hamsters.
A similar experiment cannot ethically be done in humans.
But researchers have studied doses of flu virus and found that people who inhaled a higher dose of flu virus were more likely to get sick and experience symptoms.
Observations of coronavirus outbreaks in processing plants and on cruise ships also support the idea that masks may help protect mask wearers.
Without more research, we can't be certain that masks protect the wearer.
But we do know they don't hurt, and that they protect others.
Could wearing masks prevent COVID deaths?
According to a study published in the journal Nature Medicine, widespread use of masks could prevent nearly 130,000 of 500,000 COVID-related deaths estimated to occur by March 2021.
These numbers are based on an epidemiological model.
The researchers considered, state by state, the number of people susceptible to coronavirus infection, how many get exposed, how many then become infected (and infectious), and how many recover.
They then modeled various scenarios, including mask wearing, assuming that social distancing mandates would go into effect once the number of deaths exceeded 8 per 1 million people.
Modeling studies are based on assumptions, so the exact numbers are less important than the comparisons of different scenarios.
In this study, a scenario in which 95% of people always wore masks in public resulted in many fewer deaths compared to a scenario in which only 49% of people (the self-reported national average of mask wearers) always wore masks in public.
This study reinforces the message that we can help prevent COVID deaths by wearing masks.
If I want to visit friends and family, does it matter whether we meet indoors or outdoors?
You are better off meeting friends and family outdoors.
We know that coronavirus spreads when someone breathes in virus that an infected person emits through coughs or sneezes, or when they talk or breathe.
Research has shown that in a confined, laboratory setting, droplets containing viral particles can remain afloat for eight to 14 minutes.
Smaller infectious viral particles, called aerosols, can drift around in the air even longer.
Outdoors, air currents are more likely to scatter and dilute the virus, making transmission less likely than in a home, office, or other confined space with limited air circulation.
Even outdoors, if you are not fully vaccinated, follow CDC guidance on masking and physical distancing, to reduce risk even further.
Can the COVID-19 virus spread through air conditioning?
We don't know for certain if the COVID-19 virus spreads through air conditioning.
But we do know that when it's hot and humid, people are more likely to stay indoors, with the windows closed — giving the virus more opportunity to spread.
Coronavirus spreads through droplets that an infected person emits through coughs or sneezes and through smaller, infectious viral particles that can drift around in the air for several hours.
Outdoors, air currents can scatter and dilute the virus, making transmission less likely.
You're more likely to inhale the virus indoors, with the windows closed, whether or not you have the air conditioning on.
If you must be indoors with anyone outside of your household, increase air circulation by keeping the windows open as much as possible.
Does vitamin D protect against COVID-19?
There is some evidence to suggest that vitamin D might help protect against becoming infected with, and developing serious symptoms of, COVID-19.
We know, for example, that people with low vitamin D levels may be more susceptible to upper respiratory tract infections.
One meta-analysis found that people who took vitamin D supplements, particularly those who had low vitamin D levels, were less likely to develop acute respiratory tract infections than those who didn't.
Vitamin D may protect against COVID-19 in two ways.
First, it may help boost our bodies' natural defense against viruses and bacteria.
Second, it may help prevent an exaggerated inflammatory response, which has been shown to contribute to severe illness in some people with COVID-19.
Our bodies make vitamin D when exposed to sunshine.
Five to 10 minutes of sun exposure on some or most days of the week to the arms, legs, or back without sunscreen will enable you to make enough of the vitamin.
Good food sources of vitamin D include fatty fish (such as tuna, mackerel, and salmon), foods fortified with vitamin D (such as dairy products, soy milk, and cereals), cheese, and egg yolks.
The recommended dietary dose of vitamin D is 600 IU each day for adults 70 and younger and 800 IU each day for adults over 70.
A daily supplement containing 1,000 to 2,000 IU of vitamin D is likely safe for most people.
For adults, the risk of harmful effects increases above 4,000 IU per day.
Is it safe to travel once I’m vaccinated?
What if I’m not vaccinated?
Guidance from the CDC issued in April 2021 states that fully vaccinated people may travel more freely within the US.
Travelers do not need to get COVID testing before or after travel and do not need to quarantine, unless required by local or state authorities.
The CDC is more cautious about international travel, noting the increased risk of variants in other countries, even for people who are fully vaccinated.
As a general rule, travel can increase your chance of spreading and getting COVID-19 if you are not vaccinated.
The CDC recommends that unvaccinated travels get tested before and after domestic travel and self-quarantine for 7 to 10 days after travel.
They discourage unvaccinated people from travelling outside of the US.
All travelers should wear a mask that covers the nose and mouth, maintain a physical distance of six feet from others, avoid crowds, and wash hands often.
Anyone who is sick or has tested positive for COVID-19 should not fly if at all possible.
Stay current on travel advisories from regulatory agencies.
Is there a vaccine available?
On December 11, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.
This was the first COVID-19 vaccine authorized for use in the US.
One week later, the FDA granted EUA to an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine developed by Moderna.
Will the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines work against the new coronavirus variants?
Early evidence suggests that the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine is effective against the new coronavirus variants.
Testing of the Moderna mRNA vaccine against the new variants is underway.
The two new variants are more contagious than previous SARS-CoV-2 variants, but they do not appear to be deadlier.
One, called B.1.1.7, was first detected in the United Kingdom.
The other, called B.1.351, originated in South Africa.
Both variants have now been detected in countries around the globe.
Both variants contain mutations on the virus's spike protein.
Spike proteins on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus bind to and allow the virus to enter human cells.
Interestingly, both variants share a key mutation (called N501Y) on the spike protein, which allows the virus to bind more tightly to human cells.
This mutation makes the new variants more contagious than previous SARS-CoV-2 variants.
To test the effectiveness of the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine against the new variants, researchers created a virus with the N501Y mutation.
They then took blood samples from 20 participants enrolled in their vaccine trial and exposed it to the mutated virus.
The participants’ blood contained human cells as well as antibodies made in response to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.
They found that the antibodies blocked the mutated virus from infecting human cells as effectively as it blocked the virus without the mutation.
More study is needed to see if these results hold up in real world conditions.
It’s also not known how long this protection may last, and whether the vaccines will work against other mutations found in these variants.
What do we know about the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine that the FDA has authorized for emergency use?
On December 18, 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine developed by Moderna in collaboration with scientists from the NIH.
The vaccine is approved for use in people 18 years and older.
This is the second COVID-19 vaccine authorized for use in the US.
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine received EUA during the prior week.
The FDA granted EUA based on their own analysis of efficacy and safety data as well as on the recommendation made by the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC).
VRBPAC is a group of outside experts in infectious disease, vaccinology, microbiology, immunology, and other related fields.
In briefing documents submitted to the FDA, the Moderna vaccine showed an overall efficacy of 94.
1% in preventing COVID-19.
This study enrolled 30,400 adults; half received the vaccine, half received a saltwater placebo shot.
There were 196 infections among the study participants.
Of these, 185 were in the placebo group and 11 were in the vaccine group.
All 30 cases of severe COVID occurred in the placebo group, strongly suggesting indicating that the vaccine reduces risk of severe illness.
The vaccine was similarly effective in people older and younger than 65, in men and women, in people with and without medical conditions that put them at high risk for severe illness, and in different racial and ethnic groups.
The most common vaccine side effects were pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, and chills.
This vaccine requires two doses, spaced four weeks apart.
We do not yet know how long immunity from this vaccine will last.
The Moderna vaccine contains synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA), genetic material that enters human cells and instructs them to produce the spike protein found on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
The body recognizes the spike protein as an invader and produces antibodies against it.
Soon after, the cell breaks down the mRNA into harmless pieces.
If the antibodies later encounter the actual virus, they are ready to recognize and destroy it before it causes illness.
Unlike the Pfizer vaccine, which requires ultracold storage, the Moderna vaccine can be stored at normal freezer temperatures.
This may allow for wider distribution to pharmacies and other facilities that are not equipped for ultracold storage.
What do we know about the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine that the FDA has authorized for emergency use?
The vaccine is approved for use in people 16 years and older.
This is the first COVID-19 vaccine authorized for use in the US.
The FDA granted EUA based on their own analysis of efficacy and safety data as well as on the recommendation made by the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) on December 10th.
Results from the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The data showed that the vaccine reduced the risk of COVID-19 by 95%.
The trial enrolled nearly 44,000 adults, each of whom got two shots, spaced three weeks apart; half received the vaccine and half got a placebo (a shot of saltwater).
Of the 170 cases of COVID-19 that developed in the study participants, 162 were in the placebo group and eight were in the vaccine group.
Nine of the 10 severe COVID cases occurred in the placebo group, suggesting that the vaccine reduced risk of both mild and severe COVID.
According to the NEJM article, the vaccine was similarly effective in study participants of different races and ethnicities, body weight categories, presence or absence of coexisting medical conditions, and ages (younger and older than 65).
It's worth noting that the FDA felt comfortable authorizing the vaccine for 16- and 17-year-olds, even though the number of teens enrolled in the study was small.
None of the study participants experienced serious side effects.
However, most did have pain at the injection site.
Also, about half of those receiving the vaccine reported mild to moderate fatigue or headache or both.
Chills and fever were also fairly common.
Symptoms almost always resolved within 24 to 48 hours.
This vaccine requires two doses, spaced three weeks apart.
Although the vaccine appears to provide reasonable protection after the first dose, it provides stronger protection after two doses.
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is an mRNA vaccine.
The vaccine contains synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA), genetic material that contains instructions for making proteins.
Inside the body, the mRNA enters human cells and instructs them to produce a single component of the SARS-CoV-2 virus — the "spike" protein found on the virus's surface.
mRNA vaccines must be stored at very cold temperatures; improperly stored vaccines can become inactive.
Healthcare workers and residents and staff of long-term care facilities will be the first to get the vaccine.
Should I get the COVID-19 vaccine if I already had COVID-19?
Even people who have already gotten sick with COVID-19 may benefit from the vaccine, according to the CDC.
Here's what we know.
COVID-19 can lead to serious illness and long-term complications, even in younger people and those without underlying medical conditions.
We also know that it's possible for someone who has already had COVID-19 to be re-infected, though this is not common.
On the other hand, we don't know how long natural immunity to COVID-19 — the protection that results from having been sick — lasts.
It's not clear if the strength or duration of natural immunity varies based on the severity of the initial illness.
We also don't know how long immunity conferred by vaccines lasts.
During the initial deployment of the vaccine to front line workers and people in long-term care facilities like nursing homes, people eligible for the vaccine will get it regardless of whether or not they were previously infected.
They are not being tested for antibodies prior to vaccination.
As scientists learn more about natural immunity after COVID illness, vaccination criteria based on the presence of antibodies may play a role in the future.
Will the COVID vaccine prevent me from infecting others?
The answer is, we don't know.
Clinical trials of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines found that both do a good job preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease, including severe COVID-19.
However, the trials did not measure whether a person who is vaccinated is less likely to spread the virus to someone else.
It's possible that the vaccines protect against COVID-19 disease by preventing a person from becoming infected in the first place.
However, it's also possible that the vaccine protects a person from COVID-19 illness, but does not prevent a person from becoming infected.
In other words, a vaccinated person may have replicating virus in their nose and throat even if they are protected from becoming sick.
But does that mean that you have enough virus in your nose and throat to infect someone else?
Not necessarily.
It's possible that the immune response triggered by the vaccine, which protects you from becoming sick, also reduces the amount of virus in your nose and throat to a point where you are unlikely to spread it to someone else.
But we need more research to know for sure.
Once I get the COVID-19 vaccine, can I stop taking other precautions?
The vaccine will protect you from getting sick, but it may not prevent you from infecting others.
That's why, at least for now, you should continue wearing a mask and physically distancing from others, even after you get your shot.
It's possible that the vaccines protect against COVID-19 disease by preventing a person from becoming infected.
However, it's also possible that the vaccine protects a person from getting sick but does not prevent the virus from replicating in that person's nose and throat.
Does that mean there's enough virus in your nose and throat to infect someone else?
Where does that leave us?
If you're among the first groups of people to get vaccinated, it's best to continue wearing masks and maintaining physical distance in order to protect others who haven't yet gotten the vaccine.
What needed to happen before the FDA authorized a vaccine for COVID-19?
A successful COVID-19 vaccine had to safely and effectively stimulate the body's immune system to create antibodies that protect against the COVID-19 coronavirus.
One week later, the FDA granted EUA to another mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, this one developed by Moderna.
At least two other vaccine candidates are close behind, and more possible COVID-19 vaccines are in various stages of development and testing.
Approval of a vaccine requires completion of the following steps:
Pre-clinical testing: Animals are infected with the virus.
Scientists study their immune response to see what aspects of the immune response might be critical for protection.
Normally, a vaccine is first tested in animals.
However, in the setting of a pandemic such as this one, the animal testing stage can be skipped.
Phase 1 trials: A vaccine is tested in small groups of people to determine what dose safely and consistently stimulates the immune system.
At this stage, scientists don't yet know if the immune response triggered by the vaccine will protect against the virus.
Phase 2 trials: The vaccine is given to hundreds or thousands of people.
Scientists continue to focus on whether the vaccine is safe and produces a consistent immune response.
Phase 3 trials: These trials typically enroll tens of thousands of people.
This is the first phase that involves a placebo group.
It compares the number of people who get sick in the vaccine group to the number of people who get sick in the placebo group.
This is the only phase that can show whether or not the immune response triggered by the vaccine actually protects against infection in the real world.
What are mRNA vaccines and how do they work to help prevent COVID-19?
mRNA, or messenger RNA, is genetic material that contains instructions for making proteins.
mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 contain synthetic mRNA.
Inside the body, the mRNA enters human cells and instructs them to produce the "spike" protein found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
The body recognizes the spike protein as an invader, and starts producing antibodies against it.
Soon after, the cell breaks down the mRNA into harmless pieces If the antibodies later encounter the actual virus, they are ready to recognize and destroy it before it causes illness.
Two mRNA vaccines, one created by Pfizer and BioNTech and another developed by Moderna, were granted emergency use authorization (EUA) by the FDA in December 2020.
Could an mRNA vaccine change my DNA?
An mRNA vaccine — the first COVID-19 vaccine to be granted emergency use authorization (EUA) by the FDA — cannot change your DNA.
mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 contain man-made mRNA.
Inside the body, the mRNA enters human cells and instructs them to produce the "spike" protein found on the surface of the COVID-19 virus.
Soon after a cell makes the spike protein, the cell breaks down the mRNA into harmless pieces.
At no point does the mRNA enter the cell's nucleus, which is where our genetic material (DNA) lives.
The immune system recognizes the spike protein as an invader and produces antibodies against it.
I am pregnant and plan to eventually breastfeed my baby.
Is it safe for me to get a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine?
The CDC, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG), and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine agree that the new mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna) should be offered to pregnant and breastfeeding individuals.
But there is a lot we still do not know about the safety of the vaccines in these populations, and your own doctor is in the best to position to advise you based on your personal health risks and preferences.
Here are some factors to consider.
First, although the actual risk of severe COVID-19 illness and death among pregnant individuals is very low, it is higher when compared to nonpregnant individuals from the same age group.
In addition, research suggests that having COVID-19 might increase risk for premature birth, particularly for those with severe illness.
Transmission of the virus from mother to baby during pregnancy is possible, but it appears to be a rare event.
mRNA vaccine trials did not deliberately include pregnant individuals, so our knowledge regarding the safety of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy is limited.
In animal studies, mRNA vaccines did not affect fertility or cause any problems with pregnancy.
mRNA vaccines do not contain any virus, so they cannot cause COVID-19 in a woman or her baby.
And our bodies quickly break down and eliminate mRNA particles used in the vaccine so they are unlikely to reach or cross the placenta.
On the other hand, the immunity that a woman generates from vaccination can cross the placenta, and may help to keep the baby safe after birth.
Experts also believe it is most likely safe to get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine if you’re breastfeeding, although breastfeeding people were not included in the vaccine trials.
When a person gets vaccinated while breastfeeding, their immune system develops antibodies that protect against COVID-19.
These antibodies can be passed through breast milk to the baby and are likely to help protect against infection.
What are adenovirus vaccines?
What do we know about adenovirus vaccines that are being developed for COVID-19?
Adenoviruses can cause a variety of illnesses, including the common cold.
They are being used in two leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates as capsules (the scientific term is vectors) to deliver the coronavirus spike protein into the body.
The spike protein prompts the immune system to produce antibodies against it, preparing the body to attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus if it later infects the body.
In December 2020, AstraZeneca published promising results of an adenovirus-based vaccine that it developed with researchers at the University of Oxford.
The study was published in the journal The Lancet.
The Lancet analysis of vaccine efficacy was based on 11,636 adult study participants.
Of these, 4,440 participants received a full dose of the coronavirus vaccine, followed four weeks later by another full dose.
Nearly 1,400 participants received a half dose of the coronavirus vaccine, followed four weeks later by a full dose.
The control group received a meningitis vaccine, followed by a second meningitis vaccine or a placebo (a salt water shot).
There were 131 documented cases of COVID-19, all of which occurred at least two weeks after the second shot.
The coronavirus vaccine reduced the risk of COVID-19 by an average of 70.
4%, compared to the control group.
Surprisingly, the half dose/full dose vaccine combination was more effective, reducing risk of COVID-19 by 90%.
The full dose combination reduced risk by 62%.
None of the participants who received the coronavirus vaccine developed severe COVID-19 or had to be hospitalized.
There was also a reduction in asymptomatic cases.
Most study participants were between the ages of 18 and 55, and white.
In addition, the study participants were healthy or had stable underlying medical conditions.
More data is needed to understand how effective this vaccine is in people older than 55, people of color, and people with underlying medical conditions.
This vaccine is in clinical trials around the world, including the US.
But this analysis was based on data from the United Kingdom and Brazil.
The adenovirus used in the AstraZeneca/University of Oxford vaccine is a weakened, harmless form of a chimpanzee common-cold adenovirus.
This vaccine can be safely refrigerated for several months.
Who will get the first COVID-19 vaccines and who is next?
In mid-December, healthcare workers and residents and staff of long-term care facilities became the first group in the US to start getting the COVID-19 vaccine.
The CDC has recommended that adults age 75 years and older and frontline essential workers be vaccinated next.
They will be followed by adults aged 65 to 74, people aged 16 to 64 with medical conditions that put them at high risk for severe COVID-19, and remaining essential workers.
State and local authorities are not obligated to follow the CDC's recommendations;
they may reprioritize the order in which they distribute the vaccines at their discretion.
There are about 21 million healthcare workers in the US, doing a variety of jobs in hospitals and outpatient clinics, pharmacies, emergency medical services, and public health.
Another three million people reside or work in long-term care facilities, which include nursing homes, assisted-living facilities, and residential care facilities.
COVID-19 has taken a heavy toll on residents of long-term care facilities.
Frontline essential workers are those who cannot work from home and who may not be able to physically distance while working.
They include first responders such as firefighters and police, teachers and day care workers, postal workers, and people who work in grocery stores.
The CDC's guidance is based on a recommendation from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), made up of experts in vaccinology, immunology, virology, public health, and other related fields.
Their work is not limited to the COVID-19 vaccine; they broadly advise the CDC on vaccinations and immunization schedules.
What are the promising vaccines for COVID-19 under investigation?
Around the world, there are currently over 70 different COVID-19 vaccines in various stages of testing and development: phase 1 (safety), phase 2 (optimal dose, schedule, and proof of concept), and phase 3 (effectiveness, side effects) trials in humans.
In December 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to two COVID-19 vaccines, one developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and another developed by Moderna.
These vaccines use a type of molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) that can be mass-manufactured very rapidly.
In these vaccines, mRNA induces human cells to make a protein that looks just like the spike protein that studs the surface of the coronavirus and enables it to enter human cells.
The body recognizes the spike protein as an invader, and produces antibodies against it.
Two other vaccine approaches are also showing promise.
A hybrid vaccine created by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford uses a modified, harmless form of a chimpanzee common-cold adenovirus to deliver the coronavirus spike protein into the body.
The company published promising phase 3 trial results in The Lancet in December 2020.
Another hybrid vaccine uses a human common-cold adenovirus to deliver the coronavirus spike protein into the body.
That platform was developed by Harvard Medical School scientists in collaboration with Johnson and Johnson.
This vaccine is in phase 3 trials.
A central question for COVID-19 vaccines will be how long protection might last.
Can a person who has been infected with coronavirus get infected again?
Natural immunity to COVID-19 is the protection that results from having been sick.
But we don't know how long natural immunity lasts, or how strong it is.
So can we count on natural immunity to protect us from reinfection?
If so, for how long?
Unfortunately, we don't know the answer to either of those questions.
There have been some confirmed cases of reinfection with COVID-19.
In other words, a person got sick with COVID-19, recovered, and then became infected again.
This is rare, but it can happen.
Evidence suggests that people who have already gotten sick with COVID-19 benefit from the vaccine, possibly even more than vaccinated people who were not previously infected.
For now, people are eligible to get the COVID-19 vaccine whether or not they were previously infected.
Vaccination criteria may change in the future as scientists learn more about natural immunity after COVID illness.
It's also worth noting that someone who has been reinfected — even someone with no symptoms — has the potential to spread the virus to others.
That means that if you have not been vaccinated, you should continue to wear masks, practice physical distancing, and avoid crowds as advised by the CDC.
What is herd immunity, and could it play a role in stopping the spread of COVID-19?
Herd immunity occurs when enough people become immune to a disease to make its spread unlikely.
As a result, the entire community is protected, even those who are not themselves immune.
Herd immunity is usually achieved through vaccination, but it can also occur through natural infection.
Experts initially estimated that somewhere between 60% and 70% of the population needs to be immune in order to achieve herd immunity.
More recently, they have raised that estimate to near 90%.
As of now, we are nowhere close to the numbers needed to achieve herd immunity.
Achieving herd immunity through natural infection means many people would become ill and many would die.
These risks may fall as we develop effective treatments.
However, we still don't know how long people who recover from COVID-19 will remain immune to reinfection.
Ideally, we will achieve herd immunity as more people around the world receive vaccines that will confer lasting immunity.
Will a pneumococcal vaccine help protect me against coronavirus?
Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Hemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, only help protect people from these specific bacterial infections.
They do not protect against any coronavirus pneumonia, including pneumonia that may be part of COVID-19.
However, even though these vaccines do not specifically protect against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, they are highly recommended to protect against other respiratory illnesses.
Can my pet infect me with the virus that causes COVID-19?
At present, it is considered unlikely that pets such as dogs or cats can spread the COVID-19 virus to humans.
However, pets can spread other infections that cause illness, including E.
coli and Salmonella, so wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after interacting with pets.
Can people infect pets with the COVID-19 virus?
The virus that causes COVID-19 does appear to spread from people to pets, according to the FDA.
Research has found that cats and ferrets are more likely to become infected than dogs.
If you have a pet, do the following to reduce their risk of infection:
Avoid letting pets interact with people or animals that do not live in your household.
Keep cats indoors when possible to prevent them from interacting with other animals or people.
Walk dogs on a leash maintaining at least six feet from other people and animals.
Avoid dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.
If you become sick with COVID-19, restrict contact with your pets, just like you would around other people.
This means you should forgo petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food or bedding with your pet until you are feeling better.
When possible, have another member of your household care for your pets while you are sick.
If you must care for your pet while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with your pets and wear a face mask.
What can I do to keep my immune system strong?
Your immune system is your body's defense system.
When a harmful invader — like a cold or flu virus, or the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 — gets into your body, your immune system mounts an attack.
Known as an immune response, this attack is a sequence of events that involves various cells and unfolds over time.
Following general health guidelines is the best step you can take toward keeping your immune system strong and healthy.
Every part of your body, including your immune system, functions better when protected from environmental assaults and bolstered by healthy-living strategies such as these:
Don't smoke or vape.
Eat a diet high in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
Take a multivitamin if you suspect that you may not be getting all the nutrients you need through your diet.
Exercise regularly.
Maintain a healthy weight.
Control your stress level.
Control your blood pressure.
If you drink alcohol, drink only in moderation (no more than one to two drinks a day for men, no more than one a day for women).
Get enough sleep.
Take steps to avoid infection, such as washing your hands frequently and trying not to touch your hands to your face, since harmful germs can enter through your eyes, nose, and mouth.
Should I go to the doctor or dentist for nonurgent appointments?
Many medical and dental practices have instituted comprehensive safety measures to help protect you, the doctor and office staff, and other patients.
If you feel anxious about visiting in person, call the practice.
Many doctor's offices are increasingly providing telehealth services.
This may mean appointments by phone call, or virtual visits using a video chat service.
Ask to schedule a telehealth appointment with your doctor for a new or ongoing nonurgent matter.
If, after speaking to you, your doctor would like to see you in person, he or she will let you know.
What if your appointments are not urgent but also don't fall into the low-risk category?
For example, if you have been advised to have periodic scans after cancer remission, if your doctor sees you regularly to monitor for a condition for which you're at increased risk, or if your treatment varies based on your most recent test results?
In these and similar cases, call your doctor for advice.
Should I postpone my elective surgery?
The availability of elective surgeries and procedures throughout the United States is very fluid, and may reflect the number of cases and infection rate in a given area.
If COVID-19 cases are rising in your area, it's quite possible that you already have been canceled or rescheduled by the hospital or medical center in which you are scheduled to have the procedure.
If not, you should consider postponing any procedure that can wait.
That being said, keep in mind that "elective" is a relative term.
For instance, you may not have needed immediate surgery for sciatica caused by a herniated disc.
But the pain may be so severe that you would not be able to endure postponing the surgery for weeks or perhaps months.
In that case, you and your doctor should make a shared decision about proceeding.
The COVID-19 pandemic has been a part of our daily lives since March 2020, but with about 115,000 new cases a day in the United States and the U. S.
death toll at more than 464,000, it remains as important as ever to stay vigilant and know how to protect yourself from coronavirus.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.
As the vaccines continue their roll out, here are the simple steps you can take to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect yourself and others.
Know how it spreads
Scientists are still learning about COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, but according to the CDC, this highly contagious virus appears to be most commonly spread during close (within 6 feet) person-to-person contact through respiratory droplets.
“The means of transmission can be through respiratory droplets produced when a person coughs or sneezes, or by direct physical contact with an infected person, such as shaking hands,” says Dr. David Goldberg, an internist and infectious disease specialist at NewYork-Presbyterian Medical Group Westchester and an assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.
The CDC also notes that COVID-19 can spread by airborne transmission, although this is less common than close contact with a person.
“Some infections can be spread by exposure to virus in small droplets and particles that can linger in the air for minutes to hours,” the CDC states.
These viruses may be able to infect people who are further than 6 feet away from the person who is infected or after that person has left the space.
These transmissions occurred within enclosed spaces that had inadequate ventilation.
Finally, it’s possible for coronavirus to spread through contaminated surfaces, but this is also less likely.
According to the CDC, “Based on data from lab studies on COVID-19 and what we know about similar respiratory diseases, it may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this isn’t thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
How contagious is coronavirus?
A person infected with the new coronavirus can spread the virus to 1.5 – 3.5 people.
This metric, known as the R0 or R-naught, describes how contagious a virus is.
Here, we show how quickly the new coronavirus can jump from 1 infection to over 1 million.
Practice social distancing
Since close person-to-person contact appears to be the main source of transmission, social distancing remains a key way to mitigate spread.
The CDC recommends maintaining a distance of approximately 6 feet from others in public places.
This distance will help you avoid direct contact with respiratory droplets produced by coughing or sneezing.
In addition, studies have found that outdoor settings with enough space to distance and good ventilation will reduce risk of exposure.
“There is up to 80% less transmission of the virus happening outdoors versus indoors,” says Dr. Ashwin Vasan, an assistant attending physician in the Department of Medicine at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center and an assistant professor at the Mailman School of Public Health and Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.
“One study found that of 318 outbreaks that accounted for 1,245 confirmed cases in China, only one outbreak occurred outdoors.
That’s significant.
I recommend spending time with others outside.
We’re not talking about going to a sporting event or a concert.
We’re talking about going for a walk or going to the park, or even having a conversation at a safe distance with someone outside.
Wash your hands
Practicing good hygiene is an important habit that helps prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Make these CDC recommendations part of your routine:
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
It’s especially important to wash:
Before eating or preparing food
Before touching your face
After using the restroom
After leaving a public place
After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing
After handling your mask
After changing a diaper
After caring for someone who’s sick
After touching animals or pets
If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Cover all surfaces of your hands with the sanitizer and rub them together until they feel dry.
Visit the CDC website for guidelines on how to properly wash your hands and use hand sanitizer.
And see our video below on how soap kills the coronavirus.
There’s plenty of science behind this basic habit.
“Soap molecules disrupt the fatty layer or coat surrounding the virus, ” says Dr. Goldberg.
“Once the viral coat is broken down, the virus is no longer able to function.
In addition to hand-washing, disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily.
This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
Wear a mask
Face masks have become essential accessories in protecting yourself and others from contracting COVID-19.
The CDC recommends that people wear face coverings in public settings, especially since studies have shown that individuals with the novel coronavirus could be asymptomatic or presymptomatic.
Face masks, however, do not replace social distancing recommendations.)
“Face masks are designed to provide a barrier between your airway and the outside world,” says Dr. Ole Vielemeyer, medical director of Weill Cornell ID Associates and Travel Medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center and Weill Cornell Medicine.
“By wearing a mask that covers your mouth and nose, you will reduce the risk of serving as the source of disease spread by trapping your own droplets in the mask, and also reduce the risk of getting sick via droplets that contain the coronavirus by blocking access to your own airways.
Restrict your travel
Traveling can increase the spread of COVID-19 and put you at risk for contracting the disease.
The CDC recommends avoiding non-essential travel to many international destinations during the pandemic.
It also advises people to weigh the risks when it comes to domestic travel: “Travel increases your chance of getting and spreading COVID-19,” states the CDC.
“Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.
“For people at risk for the complications of COVID-19, such as those with underlying medical conditions or those who are older, it’s prudent to avoid travel,” says Dr. Goldberg.
If you must travel, take safety measures, consider your mode of transportation, and stay up to date on the restrictions that are in place at your destination.
Adhering to your state’s quarantine rules after traveling will help prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Watch for symptoms
The symptoms of infection for the coronavirus are often similar to those of other respiratory virus infections, such as influenza.
Symptoms can include:
Fever or chills
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Muscle or body aches
New loss of taste or smell
Congestion or runny nose
Nausea or vomiting
With the COVID-19 pandemic now coinciding with flu season, it’s important to recognize the differences in symptoms — as well as get a flu shot.
“The medical community is concerned that if we have an increased number of influenza cases, it will strain the hospital system on top of what’s already going on with the COVID-19 pandemic,” says Dr. Ting Ting Wong, an attending physician and infectious disease specialist at NewYork-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital.
If you think you may have been exposed to a person with COVID-19 and have symptoms, call ahead to a doctor’s office to see if you can get tested.
You can also use a virtual care platform, such as NewYork-Presbyterian’s NYP OnDemand, to meet with a healthcare professional by videoconference.
Avoid contact with others and wear a face mask if you need to leave your home when you are sick.
How NewYork-Presbyterian is prepared
NewYork-Presbyterian continues to follow the situation closely and implement the recommendations provided by our local and state departments of health and the CDC.
Our medical staff is trained to recognize patients who may have the virus and will help prevent COVID-19 from spreading.
We understand how important the support of loved ones and friends is to patients during their hospital stay.
Stay up to date with NewYork-Presbyterian’s visitor guidelines.
It’s our priority to keep patients and visitors safe from infection.
7 Halloween Safety Tips During the COVID-19 Pandemic
A pediatrician shares ways that families can celebrate the holiday safely and still have fun.
Halloween safety during the COVID-19 pandemic
Halloween is traditionally filled with trick-or-treating, haunted houses, and costume parades.
But, as with many aspects of life this year, the coronavirus pandemic has forced families to consider safety in a whole new light this Halloween, especially with the potential for a flu and COVID-19 twindemic.
Don’t cancel Halloween, says Dr. Gopi Desai, a pediatrician with NewYork-Presbyterian Medical Group Queens and an assistant professor of clinical pediatrics at Weill Cornell Medicine.
“For adults and for children, our whole lives were pretty much turned upside down in the past six months, so I think that it’s really important to maintain some structure and not to just cancel everything,” says Dr. Desai.
“If Halloween is something your child really enjoys, you can still celebrate it and keep your children engaged and involved, but in ways that are safer.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released its guidance for how to safely celebrate and mitigate risks.
Traditional trick-or-treating and crowded indoor costume parties or haunted houses are considered higher-risk activities.
A candy scavenger hunt with your household members in or around your home and a virtual costume party are deemed lower-risk activities.
Health Matters spoke with Dr. Desai for more tips on how we can keep children happy and protected this Halloween.
Wear a mask, wash your hands, and practice social distancing.
Families have been encouraged to follow these basic safety precautions to protect themselves from COVID-19, and this holds true for Halloween.
“If you’re going to be with people outside your own household, try as much as possible to make those gatherings small and outdoors,” says Dr. Desai.
Staying outside, trying to maintain distance, washing hands, wearing masks, those are really the big things.
Avoiding group activities indoors is going to be key as we get into the chillier months.
Don’t go traditional trick-or-treating.
Traditional trick-or-treating involves close, face-to-face contact with people outside your household.
Avoid it, says Dr. Desai.
You’re going up to a new household.
They open their door.
You’re within 6 feet of each other,” says Dr. Desai.
Even though the interaction is brief, it’s still an exposure.
For the same reasons, Dr. Desai discourages apartment building trick-or-treating, which has the added factors of being indoors and potentially crowded hallways and elevators.
If you want to trick-or-treat, look for ways to participate in one-way trick-or-treating.
People have come up with creative solutions, such as a homemade candy chute or leaving individually wrapped goody bags at the end of their driveway.
The CDC considers this a moderate-risk activity.
The key is to minimize contact wherever possible.
“If you pass by a house where there’s a big bowl of candy for everyone to pick out of, skip that house and move on to houses where they’ve left out individually wrapped candy bags,” advises Dr. Desai.
That way you don’t have to worry as much about who else has touched it before.
Don’t agonize over sanitizing every piece of candy.
Washing hands remains important, but parents shouldn’t feel the need to wipe down every piece of candy — especially if you’re only bringing home individual goody bags.
“We now know that the primary way this virus spreads is breathing in the air of other people who have it,” says Dr. Desai.
Can there be some surface transmission?
It’s possible.
So, it is probably safest to avoid sticking your hands in a big bowl of candy that many other people have also touched.
Try to stick to prewrapped goody bags.
The best thing you can do is to try to normalize the situation a little bit and try to get your candy in a way that’s safe.
Get creative with your at-home festivities.
There are plenty of ways to make Halloween enjoyable without leaving the house.
Dr. Desai suggests creating a candy scavenger hunt, where you can hide pieces of candy or goody bags around your home or in the yard.
“The kids can dress up in their costumes and run around trying to find the candy,” she says.
Zoom costume parties, pumpkin carving, and physically distanced outdoor costume parades with a small group are also great, lower- to moderate-risk options.
“Halloween is on a Saturday this year, so you have the whole day to walk around in your costume, look at the decorations, and enjoy the holiday without necessarily interacting with a lot of people,” says Dr. Desai.
How Safe Is It?
The Risk Levels of Halloween Activities Based on CDC Guidance
Visit outdoor Halloween and fall attractions during off periods.
Many fun fall traditions such as pumpkin patches, corn mazes, and farm visits take place outdoors, which makes them safer activities.
But be sure to assess the situation in real time.
If it’s busy and harder to keep your distance from other people, then move on to a backup plan.
“Try going during off hours or on weekdays,” Dr. Desai says.
“Going to a pumpkin patch in the middle of October at 1 p.m. on a Saturday is probably going to be quite packed.
If you try to anticipate those things beforehand, then you won’t end up getting there and either feeling uncomfortable or having to leave.
Don’t forget to bring hand sanitizer since fall activities are generally hands-on.
“Let them run around, but during the process, try to minimize how much they put their hands in their mouth and touch their face,” says Dr. Desai.
Include your kids in the planning.
It’s important to talk to your kids as early and as frequently as possible about Halloween plans and safety precautions to set their expectations.
“Get them involved in the decision-making,” says Dr. Desai.
“Say, ‘We may not be able to go trick-or-treating.
Would you prefer to do a virtual Halloween costume party or pumpkin carving instead?
Let them choose and they’ll be more invested in the whole day.
Be ready to pivot.
It’s possible you’ll make Halloween plans, then have to change them if it seems unsafe.
Just make sure your children are aware that plans could change and that there’s a Plan B.
If your child is at an age when changing plans isn’t going to go over well, opt for a fun activity at home, where you can avoid being in a risky situation or having an unhappy child.
Ultimately, let your kids know that they won’t miss out this year.
“I encourage a lot of communication,” says Dr. Desai.
“Halloween’s going to be different, but try to reassure them: We’re going to have fun and celebrate.”
Very Low Risk to Newborns from Moms with COVID-19, Study Finds
Moms with COVID-19 who take basic precautions rarely pass the virus to their newborns, even if breastfeeding and rooming together, research indicates.
Very Low Risk to Newborns from Moms with COVID-19
4 MIN READ COVID-19 OUTBREAK
Mothers with SARS-CoV-2 infection rarely transmit the virus to their newborns when basic infection-control practices are followed, according to a new study by researchers at Columbia University Irving Medical Center and NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital.
The findings — the most detailed data available on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission between women and their newborns — suggest that more extensive measures like separating COVID-19-positive mothers from their newborns and avoiding direct breastfeeding may not be warranted.
The study was published online Oct.
12 in JAMA Pediatrics.
“Our findings should reassure expectant mothers with COVID-19 that basic infection-control measures during and after childbirth — such as wearing a mask and engaging in breast and hand hygiene when holding or breastfeeding a baby — protected newborns from infection in this series,” says Dr. Cynthia Gyamfi-Bannerman, the Ellen Jacobson Levine and Eugene Jacobson Professor of Women’s Health in Obstetrics and Gynecology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, a maternal-fetal medicine expert at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, and a senior author of the paper.
Basic Infection Prevention
The researchers examined outcomes in the first 101 newborns born to COVID-19-positive mothers at NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital or NewYork-Presbyterian Allen Hospital from March 13 to April 24, 2020.
To reduce the risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to newborns after delivery, hospital staff practiced social distancing, wore masks, and placed COVID-positive moms in private rooms.
The hospitals provided the women with educational materials about COVID-19 and shortened hospital stays for all mothers without complications from delivery.
Most of the newborns roomed with their mothers, including during the first postpartum checkup.
Some were admitted to the newborn intensive care unit for non-COVID-related health reasons.
Infants who roomed with their moms were placed in protective cribs 6 feet away from the mothers’ beds when resting.
Direct breastfeeding and skin-to-skin contact with babies were strongly encouraged, provided the moms wore masks and washed hands and breasts with soap and water.
“During the pandemic, we continued to do what we normally do to promote bonding and development in healthy newborns, while taking a few extra precautions to minimize the risk of exposure to the virus,” says Dr. Gyamfi-Bannerman.
Two of the newborns tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 but had no clinical evidence of illness.
The researchers were unable to pinpoint how the babies became infected.
Physicians followed up with about half the infants, including the two who tested positive for the virus, during the first two weeks of life, and all remained well.
Data Support Breastfeeding, Skin-to-Skin Contact
In the early stage of the pandemic, a number of pediatric and health organizations had released interim guidelines for pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2, recommending the separation of mothers and newborns during their hospital stay, no direct breastfeeding, and bathing newborns as soon as possible.
Normally, newborns are bathed a day after delivery because doing so earlier interferes with bonding and breastfeeding and increases the risk of dangerously low temperatures and blood sugars.
“These recommendations were made in the absence of data on rates of mother-to-newborn SARS-CoV-2 transmission and are based on experience with mother-newborn transmission of other infectious diseases,” says lead author Dr. Dani Dumitriu, an assistant professor of pediatrics in psychiatry at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and a pediatric newborn hospitalist in the Division of Child and Adolescent Health at NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital.
“But some of the recommendations conflict with what we know about the developmental benefits of early breastfeeding and skin-to-skin contact.
Our study offers further evidence that these measures may not be necessary for healthy newborns with SARS-CoV-2-positive moms.
Since then, the American Academy of Pediatrics has updated its guidance on rooming-in for mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.
“We think it’s particularly important that mothers with SARS-CoV-2 have the opportunity to directly breastfeed their newborns,” Dr. Gyamfi-Bannerman says.
“Breast milk is known to protect newborns against numerous pathogens, and it may help protect newborns against infection with the virus.
Most studies have not found SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk, and breast milk has been found to contain antibodies against the virus.
EU and WHO join together to support COVID-19 preparedness and response and health system strengthening in Cambodia
2 June 2021 Joint News Release
This week, the European Union (EU) and the World Health Organization (WHO) announced they have joined forces to support preparedness for and response to COVID-19 and future health security threats in Cambodia.
The European Union is investing a total of more than €2.
8 million (USD $3.
5 million) over three years, through WHO, to support the Royal Government of Cambodia’s preparedness and response to COVID-19, and to strengthen health system.
This funding is part of a specific EU-WHO regional health programme to support ASEAN member states.
“Partnership between the EU and WHO to support COVID-19 preparedness and response is an indication of solidarity and cooperation for helping the country during the difficult time.
The Ministry of Health will continue to work closely with WHO to strengthen Cambodia’s health security system,” said His Excellency Professor Mam Bunheng, Minister of Health, Cambodia.
“For more than a decade, Cambodia has been strengthening its health security system, including pandemic preparedness,” said Dr Li Ailan, WHO Representative to Cambodia.
“This investment from the EU and partnership will contribute to our collective efforts to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and make the country better prepared for public health emergencies.
“The European Union and its member states, as “Team Europe”, are collectively committed to working with Cambodia to tackle the social, economic and environmental consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, to build back better, ensuring that no one is left behind.
Team Europe has to-date provided € 2.
2 billion, to help 92 low and middle-income countries, including Cambodia, to help gain access to COVID-19 vaccines – the COVAX facility.
We are proud that Team Europe is the largest contributor to the facility.
The EU is also very pleased that Cambodia was the first country in the Asia-Pacific region receiving 324,000 doses of vaccine on 2nd of March 2021 through the COVAX facility”, said HE Ambassador Carmen Moreno of the European Union to Cambodia.
“On behalf of the European Union, I am glad that the EU has signed a contract with WHO to strengthen Cambodia’s capacity to respond to the pandemic and build up a resilient health system.
This support comes now when it is most needed.
Solidarity and collective action are essential to overcome the COVID19 crisis in Cambodia, in ASEAN and in the rest of the world.
Together we are stronger!”, added HE Ambassador Carmen Moreno.
In line with the International Health Regulations (2005), the Global Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan and as guided by the Asia Pacific strategy for emerging diseases and public health emergencies (APSED III), this new investment aims to strengthen health systems and to support COVID-19 preparedness and response in Cambodia, including through reaching the unreached approach.
The funds will be used to:
Mobilize various sectors and communities to ensure participation in prevention, preparedness and response;
Respond to sporadic cases, clusters and community transmission;
Suppress virus transmission; and
Reduce deaths from COVID-19.
As part of WHO’s ongoing work to support the Royal Government of Cambodia, it has been coordinating the international response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and has been intensifying its engagement and collaboration with technical and operational partners, as well as other stakeholders.
The EU is a welcome addition to the partners responding to COVID-19 in Cambodia.
Note to Editors: EU - WHO- partnership to strengthen health systems in eight-countries in the region and coordination of ASEAN
The EU - WHO- partnership in Cambodia is part of a broader South East Asia pandemic preparedness and response programme between the EU and WHO.
The EU is providing €20 million for eight priority countries in South-East Asia.
WHO will use the funds to continue supporting the governments of Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.
The programme represents a joint effort between the EU and WHO’s Regional Offices for South-East Asia (which includes Indonesia, Myanmar and Thailand) and the Western Pacific (which includes Cambodia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam).
To ensure that the interventions in each country will be in line with national priorities as outlined in the national response plans, each WHO Region is working closely with the governments of those countries and other stakeholders, including civil society organizations.
In addition, the WHO will use the opportunity provided by the EU funding to engage with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which includes all eight countries in the programme, to enhance coordination among ASEAN Member States and promote a regional approach in response to COVID-19, where common challenges are faced.
The contribution of the EU is critical to WHO’s efforts to support countries including Cambodia in responding to the ongoing pandemic in South East Asia, and demonstrates the EU’s solidarity as well as its continued commitment to global health.

Fiji intensifies COVID-19 response efforts
2 June 2021 News release Fiji
Fiji is experiencing a surge in new cases of COVID-19 after almost a year of being COVID-free, with a total of 425 cases reported since the current outbreak started in April 2021.
The Ministry of Health and Medical Services is leading the government’s intensive nationwide campaign to stamp out the virus, quarantining the highest risk areas and scaling up testing to more than 2600 samples per day.
All options are being considered to tackle this outbreak.
Fiji, with the advice and support of the World Health Organization (WHO), continues to conduct rigorous contact tracing and cluster investigations while collecting and analyzing a range of data to inform public health decisions.
Community disease surveillance has been expanded to enable individuals and local communities to report potential health events to local authorities.
Supporting the vulnerable, and those who are in need, while maintaining access to essential medical and social services are integral parts of the government’s response.
The Pacific island nation is also making strides in its COVID-19 vaccination campaign.
To date, Fiji has vaccinated 163,364 individuals with their first dose of the vaccine.
This is 31% of the target population, which, in Fiji, is people aged 18 and older.
Additionally, more than 4,300 individuals, mainly frontline workers vaccinated with the initial supply of COVAX-donated vaccines in March, have now received their second dose and are fully vaccinated.
The vaccination programme is expected to accelerate and reach all the divisions and sub-divisions as more vaccines are received from COVAX and pledged donations from the governments of Australia and New Zealand.
Backing up Fijian response efforts are a range of national and international partners providing technical advice, funding and the delivery of life-saving medical equipment and supplies.
Below are some examples of the support being provided by these partners.
Support from the World Health Organization
During the pandemic, WHO’s Suva-based emergencies team has been working with the Ministry of Health and Medical Services on a daily basis to ensure that the country’s response is based on the latest data and evidence.
While the Ministry is in the driving seat and makes the decisions on the response, they can call upon the advice of WHO staff with expertise in a range of areas including emergency response management, epidemiology, logistics and risk communication.
We’ve been impressed with the Ministry’s response and the whole-of-government approach taken to date
acting WHO Representative, Dr Akeem Ali
“WHO and the Ministry of Health and Medical Services have been working together as one team throughout this pandemic,” said acting WHO Representative, Dr Akeem Ali.
“ We’ve been impressed with the Ministry’s response and the whole-of-government approach taken to date and we’re proud to stand alongside our Ministry colleagues as they do what’s necessary to protect health and save lives during this crisis.
During the current surge in cases, WHO’s support has focused on scaling up efforts to rapidly detect, trace and cut off the spread of COVID-19.
This includes support for disease surveillance, contact tracing, testing, infection prevention and control, vaccination and the promotion of other protective behaviours.
Among other things, WHO has procured machines for the testing of COVID-19, testing kits, personal protective equipment and other medical supplies worth more than USD $ 2.
6 million for Fiji since April 2021, which will continue to arrive in the next few months.
From other partners
Neighbours Australia and New Zealand have both been closely involved in the COVID-19 response in Fiji and the Pacific more broadly.
The countries join WHO, other United Nations agencies, and the Pacific Community on the Joint Incident Management Team for the Pacific, providing, not only funding, but technical advice to guide the response.
Support for Fiji’s COVID-19 response also comes from governments much farther away, including the European Union and the United Kingdom.
Recently, WHO and the EU have been working together to support Fiji’s efforts to scale up laboratory capacity, including through the procurement of testing equipment and related supplies.
The EU is also a key supporter of COVAX, the global initiative led by WHO to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.
The United Kingdom also supported the procurement of critical medical supplies to strengthen the health system in Fiji.
What this means for Fiji
As more cases are being detected and investigated in Fiji, a range of public health measures are continually being assessed and implemented by the government.
All government departments are working together to consider all possibilities and determine the best options for Fiji at each point of the response to the outbreak.
The decisions are based on local context and the expected overall impact on the health of the population, the economy, livelihoods, security and safety, amongst many other factors.
But one thing is clear.
Stamping out COVID-19 requires everyone to play their part – whether that’s the international community, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services or the citizens of Fiji.
“We hope that the almost 900 000 people who call Fiji home know that they have our support,” continued Dr Ali.
“We are behind you every step of the way as you continue to stay away from others, wash your hands, wear a mask and seek vaccination.
COVAX ships 828,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Malaysia
21 May 2021 Joint News Release Kuala Lumpur
Malaysia has received the second batch of COVID-19 vaccines, shipped via the COVAX Facility, or COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Plan, a partnership between the World Health Organization (WHO), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).
This is another important step in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and supporting the immunization efforts by the government of Malaysia.
The 559,200 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines that arrived today follows the April 21st COVAX shipment of 268,800 doses to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
In total, Malaysia has received 828,000 doses of the expected 1,387,200 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine provided by the COVAX Facility.
The arrival in Kuala Lumpur marks an important milestone for the COVAX Facility in its effort to deliver at least 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2021.
The COVAX Facility is an unprecedented global effort to provide every country in the world with equitable access to safe COVID-19 vaccines as rapidly as possible.
COVAX is part of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, a ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate development, production, and equal access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.
The Government of Malaysia through the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation have been working together with WHO and UNICEF to bring life-saving vaccines to Malaysia.
“We are excited to see the second shipment of the COVID-19 vaccines as part of the COVAX Facility arriving in Malaysia this morning.
We are very happy with this close partnership with the Government of Malaysia and relevant ministries for the opportunity to reach families and communities with life-saving vaccines.
This is another contribution to the government’s effort to safeguard the lives of citizens and non-citizens in Malaysia.
Our partnership will continue, and we will overcome this pandemic together,” said Dr Rashed Mustafa Sarwar, UNICEF Representative to Malaysia and Special Representative to Brunei Darussalam.
“The arrival of vaccines through COVAX Facility is timely as with the current surge of cases, we must take every opportunity available to vaccinate as many people as possible and reduce hospitalization and deaths.
Priority should be given to those who need it most – senior citizens and people with other underlying health conditions.
WHO and its partners are working to ensure that more and different types of vaccines are made available through COVAX Facility, and we encourage people in Malaysia to register for their vaccination while continuing to be vigilant, as that is our best chance to stay healthy and be protected against COVID-19,” said Dr Lo Ying-Ru Jacqueline, WHO Representative to Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam and Singapore.
Based on current evidence, the COVID-19 vaccine can protect individuals from severe disease and reduce hospitalizations and deaths.
Nevertheless, they should complement, and not replace, proven public health measures such as physical distancing, wearing masks, respiratory and hand hygiene, and avoiding crowded and enclosed settings.
Notes to Editors
About COVAX
COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-convened by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance Gavi) and the World Health Organization (WHO) – working in partnership with UNICEF as key implementing partner, developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers, the World Bank, and others.
It is the only global initiative that is working with governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries.
CEPI’s role in COVAX
CEPI is leading on the COVAX vaccine research and development portfolio, investing in R&D across a variety of promising candidates, with the goal to support development of three safe and effective vaccines which can be made available to countries participating in the COVAX Facility.
As part of this work, CEPI has secured first right of refusal to potentially over one billion doses for the COVAX Facility to a number of candidates, and made strategic investments in vaccine manufacturing, which includes reserving capacity to manufacture doses of COVAX vaccines at a network of facilities, and securing glass vials to hold 2 billion doses of vaccine.
CEPI is also investing in the ‘next generation’ of vaccine candidates, which will give the world additional options to control COVID-19 in the future.
Gavi’s role in COVAX
Gavi is leading on procurement and delivery at scale for COVAX:
coordinating the design, implementation and administration of the COVAX Facility and the COVAX AMC and working with its Alliance partners UNICEF and WHO, along with governments, on country readiness and delivery.
As part of this role, Gavi hosts the Office of the COVAX Facility to coordinate the operation and governance of the mechanism as a whole, manages relationships with Facility participants, and negotiates advance purchase agreements with manufacturers of promising vaccine candidates on behalf of the 190 economies participating in the COVAX Facility.
It also coordinates design, operation and fundraising for the COVAX AMC that supports 92 lower-income economies, including a no-fault compensation mechanism that will be administered by WHO.
As part of this work, Gavi supports governments and partners on ensuring country readiness, providing funding and oversight of UNICEF procurement of vaccines as well as partners’ and governments work on readiness and delivery.
This includes support for cold chain equipment, technical assistance, syringes, vehicles, and other aspects of the vastly complex logistical operation for delivery.
WHO’s role in COVAX
WHO has multiple roles within COVAX:
It provides normative guidance on vaccine policy, regulation, safety, R&D, allocation, and country readiness and delivery.
Its Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization develops evidence-based immunization policy recommendations.
Its Emergency Use Listing (EUL) / prequalification programmes ensure harmonized review and authorization across member states.
It provides global coordination and member state support on vaccine safety monitoring.
It developed the target product profiles for COVID-19 vaccines and provides R&D technical coordination.
WHO leads, together with UNICEF, the Country Readiness and Delivery workstream, which provides support to countries as they prepare to receive and administer vaccines.
Along with Gavi and numerous other partners working at the global, regional, and country-level, the CRD workstream provides tools, guidance, monitoring, and on the ground technical assistance for the planning and roll-out of the vaccines.
Along with COVAX partners, WHO has developed a no-fault compensation scheme as part of the time-limited indemnification and liability commitments.
UNICEF’s role in COVAX
UNICEF is leveraging its experience as the largest single vaccine buyer in the world and working with manufacturers and partners on the procurement of COVID-19 vaccine doses, as well as freight, logistics and storage.
UNICEF already procures more than 2 billion doses of vaccines annually for routine immunisation and outbreak response on behalf of nearly 100 countries.
In collaboration with the PAHO Revolving Fund, UNICEF is leading efforts to procure and supply doses of COVID-19 vaccines for COVAX.
In addition, UNICEF, Gavi and WHO are working with governments around the clock to ensure that countries are ready to receive the vaccines, with appropriate cold chain equipment in place and health workers trained to dispense them.
UNICEF is also playing a lead role in efforts to foster trust in vaccines, delivering vaccine confidence communications and tracking and addressing misinformation around the world.
About ACT-Accelerator
The Access to COVID-19 Tools ACT-Accelerator, is a new, ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.
It was set up in response to a call from G20 leaders in March 2020 and launched by the WHO, European Commission, France and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in April 2020.
The ACT-Accelerator is not a decision-making body or a new organisation, but works to speed up collaborative efforts among existing organisations to end the pandemic.
It is a framework for collaboration that has been designed to bring key players around the table with the goal of ending the pandemic as quickly as possible through the accelerated development, equitable allocation, and scaled up delivery of tests, treatments and vaccines, thereby protecting health systems and restoring societies and economies in the near term.
It draws on the experience of leading global health organisations which are tackling the world’s toughest health challenges, and who, by working together, are able to unlock new and more ambitious results against COVID-19.
Its members share a commitment to ensure all people have access to all the tools needed to defeat COVID-19 and to work with unprecedented levels of partnership to achieve it.
The ACT-Accelerator has four areas of work:
diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines and the health system connector.
Cross-cutting all of these is the workstream on Access & Allocation.
Vanuatu receives 24,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX Facility
20 May 2021 News release Vanuatu
Port Vila, Vanuatu, 20 May 2021 – Yesterday on 19 May, Vanuatu joins Fiji, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Nauru, Tuvalu and Samoa, in the Pacific islands, to receive COVID-19 vaccine doses shipped via the COVAX Facility, a partnership between CEPI, Gavi, UNICEF and WHO.
This is a historic step towards achieving the goal to ensure equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines globally, in what will be part of the largest vaccine procurement and supply operation in history.
The 19 May 2021 arrival in Port Vila of 24,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID19 vaccine marks the seventh country for vaccines to arrive in the Pacific region through the COVAX Facility in the global partnership’s effort to deliver at least two billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2021.
On receiving the news of the arrival of the vaccine, the Prime Minister Honourable Bob Loughman Weibur, stated, “Vanuatu has been so fortunate to have been COVID-19-free for a long time thanks to the measures the Government had the foresight to implement.
In that time, we have worked hard to put in place a national plan for rollout of the vaccine - an important tool to fight the pandemic.
We are appreciative of a mechanism like the COVAX Facility that enabled Vanuatu to receive our first batch of COVID-19 vaccines to protect our front liners.
With no COVID-19 cases in the country, unlike our unfortunate Pacific neighbours, it is the opportune time for us to roll out the vaccination programme in a smooth and peaceful way to protect ourselves, our families, communities and future.
Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccination Alliance, emphasized that “COVAX's mission is to help end the acute phase of the pandemic as soon as possible, allowing global equitable access to vaccines against COVID-19.
“This pandemic continues to devastate children and their communities around the world,” said UNICEF Pacific Representative, Sheldon Yett.
“We will continue to work with the Government of Vanuatu and partners to support vaccination efforts and other essential public health measures needed to keep communities protected.
“It is great news that Vanuatu is receiving the vaccines,” said Dr. Eunyoung Ko, WHO Country Liaison Officer of Vanuatu.
As we have seen here over the past year, the risk of COVID-19 is always present as long as we have connections with the outside world.
This is why vaccines are so important, especially for the priority population: health workers, front liners, including border and quarantine workers, older persons, and people with underlying health conditions.
The COVID-19 vaccine will protect you and your family from becoming severely ill should you get infected with the virus in the future.
This is one of the effective ways for us to protect our population while maintaining other public health measures, such as, physical distance and practice hand hygiene.
The Ministry of Health in Vanuatu, in its first phase of vaccine rollout, is targeting health workers and other frontline staff in line with global recommendations.
This will include frontline healthcare workers, border control staff, and public transport drivers who are responding to COVID-19 quarantine and management of operations.
Other priority in the first phase is elderly (55 years and above) and people living with existing conditions.
Preparations are well underway for a national launch and planned roll out of the COVID19 vaccine from early June.
For several months, COVAX partners have been supporting governments and partners in readiness efforts, in preparation for this moment.
They have been especially active in working with countries benefitting from the Advance Market Commitment (AMC), an innovative financial mechanism to help secure global and equitable access for COVID-19 vaccines.
This includes assisting with the development of national deployment of vaccination plans, support for cold chain infrastructure, as well as stockpiling of half a billion syringes and safety boxes for their disposal, masks, gloves and other equipment to ensure that there is enough equipment for health workers to start vaccinating priority groups as soon as possible.
Vaccines are now arriving in batches to supported countries following necessary preparatory work being completed to ensure immediate administration of vaccines to priority groups identified by national governments in their vaccine deployment plans.
Vanuatu has completed preparatory work in good time and therefore able to receive allotted vaccines from COVAX today.
As vaccines start to roll out around the world, they should complement, and not replace, proven public health measures.
It is also important to expand access to rapid diagnostics and treatments, such as oxygen and dexamethasone, as advocated for by the ACT Accelerator.
Vanuatu, like other countries, will continue to apply tried-and-tested measures to successfully prevent and control transmission, such as, handwashing with soap and water, covering coughs and sneezes, and physical distancing, alongside robust programmes to test, trace, isolate and treat.
The COVAX mechanism is offering a portfolio of vaccines suitable for a range of settings and populations and is on track to meet its goal of delivering at least two billion doses of vaccines to participating countries around the globe in 2021, including at least 1.
3 billion donor-funded doses to the 92 lower-income COVAX Facility participants supported by the Gavi COVAX AMC.
Vanuatu welcomes the arrival of this batch of vaccines and look forward to receiving additional batches needed to complete the vaccination of all eligible people living in Vanuatu.
In ensuring the safety and efficacy of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, the vaccine has undergone rigorous clinical trials and safety assessments to ensure it meets the highest level of safety standards.
COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance Gavi) and the World Health Organization (WHO) – working in partnership with UNICEF as key implementing partner, as well as civil society organisations, vaccine manufacturers, the World Bank, and others.

WHO supports efforts to enhance workplace safety systems to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the Philippines
17 May 2021 Highlights
Workplace transmission of COVID-19 continues to be a challenge in the Philippines and dedicated efforts are needed to break the chains of transmission to save lives and livelihoods.
To enhance workplace safety, the World Health Organization (WHO) Country Office in the Philippines, in partnership with the Department of Health (DOH) Center for Health Development Metro Manila and in collaboration with the Occupational Safety and Health Center (OSHC) of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) conducted a session on ‘COVID-19 Response in the Workplace’ for safety officers of local government units (LGUs) on 30 April 2021.
The Philippines has been profoundly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in loss of lives and livelihoods.
As we support the response to the pandemic, we also need to support economic revival though ensuring safety of workplaces.
The health and safety of our entire workforce is of paramount importance,” said Dr Rabindra Abeyasinghe, WHO Representative to the Philippines.
“To protect those at risk, it is imperative that local health systems redouble their efforts to implement effective infection, prevention and control strategies in all settings including workplaces.
Measures to protect workers from exposure to and infection with COVID-19 depends on exposure risk.
That risk varies based on the type of work, the level of interaction with people, and contamination of the work environment.
To assess and mitigate these factors, employers should conduct a thorough risk assessment and implement robust infection, prevent and control strategies, including contact tracing, to keep workplaces open and operational.
Building capacity and strengthening information sharing practices with respective local health offices is crucial to these efforts and will allow for a more coordinated and effective response.
Additional measures to ensure physical distancing, improve ventilation and strengthen occupational health safety protocols in the context of COVID-19, enhance early detection and isolation of cases and quarantining contacts, and protect workers in their dormitories and family homes are all important to bring back production capacity in a safe and sustainable manner.
The workplace session was attended by commissioned safety officers from different LGUs nationwide and supplemented the 40-hour mandatory course on Basic Occupational Safety and Health Training Course of the Occupational Safety and Health Services of the DOLE.
WHO will continue to provide support to the DOH and response partners to make workplaces healthier and safer by strengthening prevention and response systems to prevent, detect and respond to COVID-19 cases and establish information sharing across LGU boundaries and settings to enhance response efforts.
Viet Nam receives second shipment of COVID-19 vaccines through COVAX Facility
Joint media release of WHO and UNICEF
16 May 2021 News release Ha Noi
The second batch of COVID-19 vaccines arrives at Noi Bai airport today 16 May 2021 (Photo credit: UNICEF Viet Nam)
Hanoi, 16th May 2021 – Viet Nam received today the second shipment of 1,682,400 COVID-19 vaccine doses from the COVAX Facility.
This delivery of the vaccines comes in addition to a first batch delivered in April 2021 and is part of the 4.
1 million vaccine doses committed to Viet Nam, free of charge, by the COVAX Facility, the international partnership co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations (CEPI), GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF as a delivery partner.
Since the arrival of the first shipment of vaccines from COVAX in April, more than 816,000 COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in Viet Nam, mainly to health workers and other frontline workers.
This new shipment will help the Ministry of Health to expand coverage and reach more people from the priority groups, while also providing a second dose to those who have already received the first dose.
While the arrival of the second batch of COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX Facility is a welcome news, it will take some time for every priority group to be vaccinated.
Thus, it is essential to continue 5K practices to reduce virus transmission: wear face masks, wash hands regularly, practice physical distancing, stop gathering and fill out health declaration.
Background:
For several months, COVAX partners, CEPI, GAVI, WHO and delivery partner UNICEF, have been supporting the Government of Viet Nam in readiness efforts and the national rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.
They have been especially active in developing a National Vaccination Plan, as Viet Nam is benefiting from the COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC).
The AMC is an innovative financial mechanism to help secure global and equitable access for COVID-19 vaccines.

Advice to hospitals on how to ease pandemic pressure
12 May 2021
Hospitals in some countries and areas in the Western Pacific Region are under pressure as cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) surge.
In response, the World Health Organization (WHO) has updated its interim guidance for countries and areas in the Region to support health systems under pressure and those continuing to prepare for a rise in cases.
The publication – on managing hospital services, maintaining essential routine health care and generating surge capacity – provides guidance to national and subnational health authorities, senior decision-makers, and hospital administrators and staff.
The main principles for actions in hospitals are:
manage the COVID-19 caseload, including surge capacity,
maintain continuity of essential services,
ensure good coordination at every level,
provide clear and accurate internal and external communication,
make efficient use of scarce resources and swiftly adapt to increases in demand, and
create a safe environment for hospital staff.
The guidance joins an extensive range of WHO guidance to hospitals and health systems on managing COVID-19.
Hospitals under pressure
At Port Moresby General Hospital, a surge of patients and health worker infections are putting pressure on the wards, said Glen Mola, Professor of Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Reproductive Health at the School of Medicine of the University of Papua New Guinea.
“If the number of new infections is such that there are too many people for our health system to cope with, the health system will collapse.
It will literally collapse,” Professor Mola warned in a powerful Facebook video encouraging health workers to be vaccinated and asking people to wash their hands, wear masks, practise physical distancing and follow other official advice to prevent transmission.
WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific Dr Takeshi Kasai said, “Most countries have avoided the so-called red line, or the point where critical care needs surpass health-care capacity, large numbers of health-care workers are infected, service quality declines and deaths rapidly increase.
“Recently, however, COVID-19 cases have risen – in some places to record levels – and there are reports of hospitals reaching capacity.
Even where the epidemic is controlled, and well below the ‘red line’, hospitals must continue to play their critical role caring for COVID-19 patients while maintaining their usual essential services,” he added.
Continued vigilance as vaccines roll out
The updated publication comes as COVID-19 vaccines arrive in the Western Pacific Region.
These vaccines will help prevent severe infections and deaths, but they are not a single or simple solution, as it will still be many months before enough people are vaccinated to have an impact on the spread of the virus.
For the foreseeable future, countries must continue being vigilant and individuals must continue with proven preventive measures such as cleaning hands, wearing masks, physical distancing, and avoiding crowds, close-contact settings and confined spaces.
WHO partners with governments to strengthen health systems
COVID-19 has revealed the critical role of strong health systems for stopping transmission and for social and economic well-being.
The devastating impact of the pandemic is a reminder of the need for countries to continue to strengthen their hospital and health-care capacity as well as public health systems, making the right investments now for a safer and healthier future.
Countries in the Region have spent more than a decade strengthening their health systems to prepare for events with pandemic potential, with the support of WHO, the European Union, Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea and other partners.
Data to drive decisions about hospital capacity
Accurate and timely data are crucial to identify risks early and manage hospital demand.
In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, for example, WHO has supported the Government to rapidly develop and roll out a tablet-based system to collect information on the utilization of resources such as beds in COVID-19 wards and intensive care units (ICU), as well as ventilators and health workers in designated COVID-19 facilities.
In the Philippines, WHO worked with the Department of Health and developers to create the KAYA app and database, which help with surveillance, contact tracing and managing hospital beds.
WHO support for hospitals and health systems
Other areas of WHO support to hospitals and health systems across the Region during the pandemic include procurement and delivery of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other essential medical supplies, training competent and confident health workers, community engagement at remote rural health centres, strengthening laboratory capacity and advice on how to care for people with COVID-19.

More than 2 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines arrive in the Philippines through the COVAX Facility
8 May 2021 Media release
More than 2 million doses of AstraZeneca have arrived in the Philippines from the COVAX facility, the international partnership established to ensure equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines around the world.
This shipment is in addition to half a million doses delivered in March, and is part of the 4.
5 million total doses committed to the Philippines from COVAX.
“Now that these 2 million vaccine doses have arrived, we urge our kababayans to get their second dose of AstraZeneca vaccines.
If you are already in the priority group but have not yet registered with your LGU, please contact your LGU or barangay to get vaccinated.
Vaccination is our additional armament against the severe form of COVID-19 and will help decrease hospitalizations.
Sa tulong ng mga bakuna, mapoprotektahan nito ang ating mga sarili at ang ating mga mahal sa buhay laban sa malalang uri ng COVID-19,” Health Secretary Francisco T.
Duque III said.
Since the arrival of the first shipment of vaccines from the COVAX Facility in March, more than 2 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the Philippines.
More than 300,000 Filipinos in priority groups have received two doses and are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19.
“Each shipment of vaccines from the COVAX Facility brings us one step closer to ensuring the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines around the world and Health for All in the Philippines,” said Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe, WHO Representative to the Philippines.
“However, vaccines do not replace the important prevention measures we practice now – wearing face masks, avoiding crowded places and settings, frequent handwashing, and remaining physically distant from others.
Nearly 100 percent of the AstraZeneca vaccines delivered last March have been provided to local government units (LGUs).
As of 2 May 2021, out of the 525,600 doses, 525,337 have been administered to health workers, the elderly and persons with underlying health conditions.
This new shipment of vaccines will provide second doses to those who have already been administered the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccines, as well as other target populations.
Meanwhile, everyone – vaccinated or not – should continue to adhere to public health measures such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, hand and respiratory hygiene, and ensuring good ventilation by opening windows and doors where possible.
WHO and UNICEF are supporting the Department of Health and the Philippine government in its COVID-19 vaccine rollout from planning, to managing expectation and demand, to supporting vaccination to priority, at-risk populations such as healthcare workers, older persons and those living with underlying health conditions.
Apart from vaccine procurement and delivery, WHO and UNICEF are also assisting with development of guidelines and policies, managing cold chain and logistics, and building capacity for surveillance, contacttracing, clinical management and risk communication and community engagement at national and subnational levels.
The COVAX facility has seen an unprecedented mobilization of funding from governments, private sector, philanthropic and multilateral partners, among them Team Europe (European Commission and EU Member States), the United States, UK, Japan, Canada and Saudi Arabia.
COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance Gavi) and the World Health Organization (WHO) – working in partnership with UNICEF as key implementing partner, as well as civil society organizations, vaccine manufacturers, the World Bank, and others.
COVAX is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), GAVI and the World Health Organization (WHO), alongside key delivery partner UNICEF.
The COVAX Facility is one of the three pillars of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, an initiative begun in April 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Commission, and the government of France, as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
At present, 118 countries and territories have received more than 40.
8 million of COVID-19 doses through COVAX.
“Vaccines will be an important tool in the effort to contain COVID-19.
As they become available, we will be able to reduce the burden on our health system, prevent deaths, severe infections and hospitalizations.
Given that children have been affected by the pandemic with prolonged lockdowns and school closures, the sooner the pandemic will be brought under control, the sooner we can build a better, safer, healthier future for children and for us all,” said Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov, UNICEF Philippines Representative.
Statement for healthcare professionals: How COVID-19 vaccines are regulated for safety and effectiveness
Joint Statement from the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities and World Health Organization
Healthcare professionals and public health authorities have a central role in discussing vaccination against COVID-19 with their patients.
Vaccines play a critical role in preventing deaths, hospitalisation caused by infectious diseases.
Emerging data on effectiveness indicates that licenced COVID-19 vaccines are contributing to controlling the spread of the disease.
Until widespread vaccination has been achieved, both vaccinated and unvaccinated people need to be aware of the additional protective behaviours required to control the pandemic locally.
The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented level of public interest in vaccines.
This includes a focus on the development of vaccines and their regulatory review and safety monitoring.
Much of this coverage has taken place through mass and social media.
Reports of adverse events (side effects) have led some people to express concerns about getting vaccinated, delay getting vaccinated or even be strongly opposed to vaccination.
There are also differences in individual confidence in national safety monitoring systems.
Another challenge in communicating the importance of COVID-19 vaccination is that younger adults are typically less clinically affected by COVID-19 infection and so may see limited value in getting vaccinated, including until further data confirms that vaccines prevent transmission and that vaccines are effective against variants.
Clear and consistent communication is therefore essential to support people in making the choice to be vaccinated.
We appreciate that you, your colleagues and your patients may have a number of questions around the development, regulatory review and ongoing safety monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines.
Purpose
This joint International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities (ICMRA)* and WHO statement aims to help healthcare professionals answer questions about the role of regulators in the oversight of COVID-19 vaccines.
It explains how vaccines undergo robust scientific evaluation to determine their safety, efficacy and quality and how safety is closely and continually monitored after approval.
Vaccination has been shown to contribute to reducing deaths and severe illness from COVID-19, and to reduce the transmission of COVID-19.
Vaccinating as many people as possible and reducing the spread of disease is important.
Vaccination of a significant proportion of the population also protects vulnerable people, including those who cannot receive vaccines, or the small proportion of people who might remain at risk of infection after vaccination.
Failure to vaccinate widely also enables continued circulation of the virus and the generation of variants, including some that may pose a greater risk.
Widespread vaccination will help prevent people from having to go to hospital and contribute to fewer people getting sick, ultimately alleviating the burden of COVID-19 on healthcare systems.
It will also help allow a return to normal societal functioning and the re-opening of economies.
Vaccines and the regulatory process
How do regulatory authorities evaluate COVID-19 vaccines?
Regulators rigorously evaluate scientific and clinical evidence provided by vaccine manufacturers.
Vaccine manufactures are legally obliged to follow defined standards in the data they provide, and their clinical research and manufacturing operations are subject to regulatory oversight.
Either full or summary data from clinical trials is made available following vaccine evaluation.
Each vaccine is thoroughly assessed for safety, efficacy and pharmaceutical quality to determine whether it can be approved for use.
Regulators use available scientific evidence from preclinical laboratory research, human clinical trials, and manufacturing information to assess benefits and risks of candidate vaccines.
Regulators may seek additional expert advice from independent scientific advisory committees to help inform their decision on whether to approve a vaccine.
These committees are made up of experts in science, medicine (including infectious diseases) and public health, and often include consumer and healthcare professional representatives.
Public health agencies have a different role than regulatory authorities.
They develop and deliver vaccination programmes, often working with their expert immunisation technical advisory committees.
This includes prioritising and designating populations for vaccination with specific vaccines, issuing additional recommendations and providing information more broadly about vaccines and immunization.
They also collaborate with regulators to monitor the safety of vaccines after they are approved for use.
Globally, the public can have confidence in the rigour of the process used to scientifically evaluate the safety, efficacy and quality of vaccines before they are approved for use in the wider population.
Safety evidence prior to potential regulatory authorisation:
Safety evidence is an essential part of each regulatory submission for a COVID-19 vaccine.
It is gathered during all phases of the vaccine development process.
Robust assessment of safety is carried out in the clinical trials and submitted to regulators for review as part of the approval process.
All adverse events need to be examined and reported in the regulatory submission by the companies for a marketing licence.
Typically, regulators will require that participants in clinical trials have been followed for at least 1-2 months after receiving their final vaccine dose.
Generally, based on previous experience with vaccines, most adverse events occur within such timeframes, though rare adverse events might not be recognised until after wide population use.
There will also be longer-term (for example for 6-12 months or more) follow-up of those who participated in the earlier phases of the clinical trials of each vaccine.
Many trial participants will also be followed for at least one year to assess the duration of protection and longer-term safety of individual vaccines, and safety data from these longer-term trials will be carefully reviewed by regulators as part of post-approval monitoring of safety.
Efficacy:
Apart from information on the types of immune responses induced by the vaccine, companies must submit data from well-designed clinical trials to regulators to demonstrate that the vaccine prevents COVID-19.
The data showed there were sufficient numbers of people included in the clinical trials receiving the vaccine so that the efficacy of the vaccine can be accurately measured (generally at least 10 000 and usually 15 000 or more people who receive the vaccine, in addition to those in the control arm).
Populations in clinical trials should include a range of age groups and people with co-morbidities.
Given the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on older people, COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials have included significant numbers of older participants.
Vaccine clinical trials for a new candidate vaccine showed that vaccines very significantly reduced COVID-19 in people who were vaccinated, compared to a control group of people who did not receive the vaccine, through a reduction in numbers of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Quality:
Any COVID-19 vaccine that receives regulatory authorisation must be manufactured according to internationally accepted stringent regulatory standards of good manufacturing practices (GMP).
Regulators review data to confirm that the manufacturing process at each production site is well-controlled and consistent.
This will include data on the composition and purity of the vaccine and its potency, as well as data on every step of manufacturing and on the controls used to ensure that each batch of vaccine is consistently of a high quality.
Data on vaccine stability must also be provided before a vaccine can be approved.
After approval, batches may also undergo evaluation by individual national regulatory authorities to ensure they meet national requirements, before they can be supplied.
Monitoring safety and effectiveness after vaccine approval:
After a vaccine is approved for use, regulators conduct robust effectiveness monitoring as well as monitoring of safety and risk minimisation activities (pharmacovigilance).
They need to continuously monitor vaccine safety to ensure that the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the risks.
Regulators do this by:
Reviewing and analysing adverse events reported by healthcare professionals and consumers and requiring industry vaccine companies (sometimes called “sponsors”) to report to regulators on adverse events received both within the regulator’s home country and globally;
Many regulators will implement enhanced passive surveillance systems.
These include systems to rapidly compare numbers of suspected side effects reported with vaccines to the numbers of events expected to occur by chance, and include access to near real-time data on vaccine usage in different settings.
Several regulators also implemented traceability systems for different vaccine brands and batches;
Taking rapid action to mitigate risks, also considering the information about emerging safety issues shared among regulators and researchers through international collaboration;
Reviewing medical literature and other sources of new safety information;
Requiring vaccine manufacturers to continue safety surveillance from the ongoing clinical trials of their products; and
Many regulators also require vaccine manufacturers to have risk management plans describing how they will monitor and minimise risks, including further epidemiological studies, associated with their vaccines.
It is very important that healthcare professionals not only diligently report any adverse events they see in their patients, but also encourage people who are vaccinated to immediately report adverse events to their healthcare professionals or to the medicines regulator in countries where direct reports from members of the public are accepted by the regulator.
Reporting all relevant events helps regulators assess the possible role of the vaccine in causing the adverse event and assists in identifying safety issues relating to newly introduced vaccines.
As part of the safety monitoring and review of all suspected side effects reporting for vaccines, regulators have developed lists of “Adverse Events of Special Interest”.
These lists include some events that have been associated with other vaccines (for example anaphylaxis).
Others are included on these lists because they are serious events that are important to monitor extremely closely, even though there is no evidence that they are causally associated with specific vaccines.
Having information on the background rates of these events that would be expected in people who have not received a vaccine will help ensure that any increased reporting of these events can be quickly detected and thoroughly investigated by regulators.
The widespread use of COVID-19 vaccines, including in the elderly and in patients with underlying health conditions, will unfortunately mean that there will be deaths and serious illnesses that are purely coincidental and unrelated to vaccinations.
The job of each regulator, together with the relevant medical experts and vaccine manufacturers is to determine causality.
There will be a special focus on monitoring safety in some groups of people, such as pregnant women, persons with severe pre-existing illness, older people, children, and in people also receiving vaccines for prevention of other diseases.
Regulators, often in collaboration with public health authorities, are able to take decisive action if a safety issue is identified.
These actions might include: issuing safety communications for patients, healthcare professionals and the community; updating the product information or consumer information for the vaccine; preventing the release of a particular batch of vaccine; and, taking other regulatory actions such as restriction of vaccine authorisation to a particular subgroup of the community or revocation of authorisation.
Commonly reported adverse events
The most commonly-reported events with COVID-19 vaccines are expected vaccine side effects, such as headache, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, fever and chills and pain at the site of injection.
The occurrence of these adverse events is consistent with what is already known about the vaccines from clinical trials.
Adverse events of special interest
Regulators approve and maintain an approval of a vaccine only if they determine that the known and potential benefits of the vaccine outweigh its known and potential risks.
Anaphylaxis is a very rare side effect that may occur with any vaccine.
There have been some other reported adverse events which include facial weakness, seizures, loss of sense of taste or small and cardiac events, but none are confirmed to be causally related to the vaccines.
mRNA vaccines
The major adverse event of special interest reported for these vaccines, which include the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines is anaphylaxis.
Regulators carefully review the reports of possible anaphylaxis to determine whether they are consistent with true anaphylaxis and whether they may have been caused by the vaccine.
Anaphylaxis reports remains very rare (in the order of 10 cases per million vaccinated).
Guidance on the management of possible anaphylaxis is included in the Product Information/Label for these vaccines.
Routine vaccination procedures include keeping people under observation for at least 15 minutes after vaccination and having appropriate medical treatment on hand so that anaphylaxis can be rapidly managed.
These vaccines should not be given to people with a known history of a severe allergic reaction to any of the vaccine components.
A second dose of mRNA vaccine should not be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis to the first dose.
There have been some other reported adverse events, which include unusual bleeding and blood clotting disorders, facial weakness, seizures, loss of sense of taste or smell and cardiac events.
Regulators monitor and carefully review if there is a causal relationship between the vaccines with those adverse events, and, if appropriate, they will be included in Product Information / Product Label of vaccines of concern.
Adenovirus vector vaccines
These include the AstraZeneca, Janssen, Gamaleya and CanSino Biologics vaccines.
Internationally, the AstraZeneca and Janssen COVID-19 vaccines have been associated with a very rare and unusual clotting syndrome involving thromboembolic events (blood clots) with thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count).
This condition has been termed Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS).
Medicines regulators are meeting regularly to share information about cases to better characterise this risk and understand this syndrome.
Less information is available internationally about adverse events following the Gamaleya and CanSino Biologics vaccines.
The overall number of reports received of blood clots in the veins or arteries (including venous thrombosis or venous thromboembolism) occurring without thrombocytopenia is no higher than the expected background population rate for the more common type of blood clots in most countries.
The spontaneous reporting rates of thromboembolic events with thrombocytopenia vary by country and the precise incidences are difficult to estimate, but for the AstraZeneca vaccine, based on substantial use in Europe and the UK, the frequency of such events is very rare.
Available estimates are of the order of 10-15 per million people vaccinated (note that for some countries this statistic is based on the numbers of reports of suspected cases of TTS rather than numbers of confirmed cases).
Thromboembolic events with thrombocytopenia have also been reported in the United States for the Janssen vaccine, at a rate of about 2-3 per million doses administered.
National regulators are continuing to monitor the issue closely and to publish up to date information on the numbers of cases reported and the latest estimates of the incidence.
The cases of thromboembolic events with thrombocytopenia after vaccination were mainly reported for younger rather than older individuals.
This, together with the risk of serious illness or death associated with COVID-19 being much higher in middle-aged and older people, has led public health authorities in some countries to recommend that vaccination with the Astra Zeneca vaccine not be initiated in younger individuals.
Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and thrombocytopenia as well as coagulopathies after vaccination as TTS requires specific management.
Vaccinated individuals should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms such as a severe or persistent headache, blurred vision, shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, persistent abdominal pain or unusual skin bruising and/or petechiae (tiny purple, red, or brown spots on the skin) mostly occurring within around 4-20 days after vaccination, although some cases have been reported later than 20 days post vaccination.
This information is in the Product Information / Product Label of the vaccines as approved by regulators.
Questions and Answers on COVID-19 vaccines
Q: How have the vaccines been developed so quickly?
Does this mean that their safety and efficacy has been compromised?
A: The speed of development of COVID-19 vaccines has been unprecedented for several reasons, but the safety and efficacy requirements for vaccines have not been compromised, Vaccine development was facilitated by:
The massive financial investment by governments, industry and philanthropic organisations in vaccine development and the re-direction of much of the global research and commercial infrastructure for the development and manufacture of vaccines.
Governments also enabled companies to take the commercial risk of manufacturing some vaccine stocks ahead of regulatory approvals.
New technologies adapted from the development of other vaccines – mRNA vaccines were developed for COVID-19 very rapidly after the sequence of the COVID-19 virus was determined, but the underlying technology had been under development since much longer and production could be scaled up very quickly.
The adenovirus technology used for adenovirus vector vaccines was first tested with SARS, MERS and Ebola virus over the last 20 years, and so was able to be adapted quickly to COVID-19, which has several similarities to these viruses.
Clinical trial successes - it has been possible to rapidly recruit large numbers of volunteers into clinical trials and, with unfortunately high rates of infection in several countries, to complete trials with 10,000-50,000 people in a short period of time.
Under normal circumstances, it may take many months or even a few years to carry out trials of this size to determine whether a vaccine is effective.
Very close collaboration - between regulators, industry and clinical researchers enabled clear indications of regulatory requirements and early access to results.
Intensive and insightful research - researchers predicted that the “spike protein” on the virus would be a good target for vaccine development, and almost all vaccines have been designed to induce a response to this protein.
So far, the spike protein has produced a strong immune response in those vaccinated, and for those vaccines that have reported clinical results are highly protective from COVID-19 disease.
Q: Will mRNA vaccines affect the DNA of vaccine recipients?
A: No.
The mRNA in the vaccine has not been shown to incorporate itself into the genes of vaccine recipients and breaks down in the weeks after vaccination.
mRNA vaccines contain genetic instructions for our cells, which only read them and provide copies of the SARS-CoV2 spike protein.
This enables the body’s natural immune systems to cause a response in vaccine recipients if they are later exposed to the virus.
Q: How long will COVID-19 vaccination provide protection for immunised people?
A: We do not yet know how long protection from any of these vaccines lasts.
We will get better insights over the next 12 months.
The duration of protection provided by vaccines can vary.
For example, the seasonal influenza vaccine is given annually, because the influenza virus mutates, and protection wanes over a number of months.
Other vaccines, such as those for rubella or measles provide multi-year or even life-long protection from disease.
Mutations in key viral proteins can mean that virus variants emerge.
The SARS-CoV-2-coronavirus is prone to mutations that creates variants, some of which have become established in a number of regions of the world.
The scientific community and regulators are very actively monitoring whether the current vaccines can continue protecting people from infection with new variants.
A number of vaccine developers are currently developing vaccines against the range of variants, and it is likely that booster shots with these vaccines will increase protection against known variants.
Regulators have agreed that review of data on vaccines against variants will be facilitated based on assessment of immune response to the variant, in the same way that new seasonal influenza vaccines are evaluated each year.
Q: Why are there so many vaccine candidates?
A: As the global seriousness of the pandemic became rapidly apparent, development of effective vaccines for COVID-19 became the top priority of many pharmaceutical companies and medical research institutes.
There was also unprecedented government and private sector investment in vaccine development.
There is now a wide range of technologies for developing new vaccines - and many of the organisations developing COVID-19 vaccines have particular experience in one or more of these technologies.
This has ensured that there would still be vaccines available if some were not approved for reasons of efficacy, safety or manufacturing challenges.
Q: What if many people start getting a reaction from a particular COVID-19 vaccine?
A: Short-term reactions, such as soreness at the injection site, fatigue or headache are common following any vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines.
These reactions usually pass in a day or two.
If new evidence becomes available that suggests that a specific serious adverse event may be linked to a particular COVID-19 vaccine then regulators will take action, working collaboratively on a global basis and liaise with public health authorities.
The type of actions that can be taken depend on the nature of the adverse event, and could range from issuing safety warnings for patients, healthcare professionals and the community; updating the product information or consumer information for the vaccine to show contraindications for the use in particular patients (e. g. those with certain co-morbidities); to closely monitoring adverse events in certain groups of patients; preventing the release of a particular batch of vaccine through to temporary suspension of the use of the vaccine until more is known.
Q: How are regulators speeding up the time it takes to authorise a COVID-19 vaccine?
A: Many regulators globally have implemented faster access pathways for COVID-19 vaccines, without compromising on strict standards of safety, quality and efficacy.
Some countries have Emergency Use Authorisation pathways which assess the available data at the time of authorisation.
Exercising these provisions is a matter for those countries, taking into account the benefits versus risks in the context of the prevailing domestic pandemic situation.
Different countries may coin this pathway or authorisation routes differently but essentially, they follow the same principles.
Other countries have implemented accelerated/priority, conditional or provisional approval schemes.
Under normal circumstances, regulatory assessment begins once all information to support registration is available.
For COVID-19 vaccines, many regulators have agreed to accept data on a rolling basis to enable early evaluation of data as it becomes available.
Regulators will only be in a position to make a provisional approval decision for a vaccine once there is sufficient data to support adequately the safety, quality and effectiveness of the vaccine for its intended use.
If a decision is made to grant provisional or conditional approval, it will be based on the requirement for the sponsor to submit more comprehensive, longer term clinical data, stability data and other information with agreed timelines.
Q: Did our country approve this COVID-19 vaccine, or are we relying on another country’s approval?
A: Most countries are carrying out independent regulatory evaluations on the submitted data for each vaccine.
However, to ensure a more efficient use of resources and expertise, regulators in different countries are communicating closely on safety, efficacy and quality data and discussing technical issues as they may arise.
In many cases principles of WHO Good Reliance Practices and collaborative mechanisms leverage the output of other regulators.
Q: Why weren’t very rare blood clots with low platelets with the AstraZeneca or Janssen vaccines picked up during clinical trials?
A: Thromboembolic events with concurrent thrombocytopenia are very rare – with estimates based on the number of spontaneous reports suggesting an overall incidence on the order of 10-15 cases per million doses.
The clinical trials of these vaccines included large numbers of people, often with 10,000 to 20,000 individuals in the active vaccine arms, but even in trials of this size it was statistically unlikely that such very rare events would be detected.
This shows the importance of continual safety monitoring during the use of these vaccines, to allow very rare events to be detected and investigated further.

WHO validates Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use and issues interim policy recommendations
WHO today validated the Sinovac-CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, giving countries, funders, procuring agencies and communities the assurance that it meets international standards for safety, efficacy and manufacturing.
The vaccine is produced by the Beijing-based pharmaceutical company Sinovac.
“The world desperately needs multiple COVID-19 vaccines to address the huge access inequity across the globe,” said Dr Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Health Products.
“We urge manufacturers to participate in the COVAX Facility, share their knowhow and data and contribute to bringing the pandemic under control.
WHO’s Emergency Use Listing (EUL) is a prerequisite for COVAX Facility vaccine supply and international procurement.
It also allows countries to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer COVID-19 vaccines.
The EUL assesses the quality, safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as risk management plans and programmatic suitability, such as cold chain requirements.
The assessment is performed by the product evaluation group, composed by regulatory experts from around the world and a Technical Advisory Group (TAG), in charge of performing the risk-benefit assessment for an independent recommendation on whether a vaccine can be listed for emergency use and, if so, under which conditions.
In the case of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine, the WHO assessment included on-site inspections of the production facility.
The Sinovac-CoronaVac product is an inactivated vaccine.
Its easy storage requirements make it very manageable and particularly suitable for low-resource settings.
WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has also completed its review of the vaccine.
On the basis of available evidence, WHO recommends the vaccine for use in adults 18 years and older, in a two-dose schedule with a spacing of two to four weeks.
Vaccine efficacy results showed that the vaccine prevented symptomatic disease in 51% of those vaccinated and prevented severe COVID-19 and hospitalization in 100% of the studied population.
Few older adults (over 60 years) were enrolled in clinical trials, so efficacy could not be estimated in this age group.
Nevertheless, WHO is not recommending an upper age limit for the vaccine because data collected during subsequent use in multiple countries and supportive immunogenicity data suggest the vaccine is likely to have a protective effect in older persons.
There is no reason to believe that the vaccine has a different safety profile in older and younger populations.
WHO recommends that countries using the vaccine in older age groups conduct safety and effectiveness monitoring to verify the expected impact and contribute to making the recommendation more robust for all countries.
WHO emergency use listing
The emergency use listing (EUL) procedure assesses the suitability of novel health products during public health emergencies.
The objective is to make medicines, vaccines and diagnostics available as rapidly as possible to address the emergency, while adhering to stringent criteria of safety, efficacy and quality.
The assessment weighs the threat posed by the emergency as well as the benefit that would accrue from the use of the product against any potential risks.
The EUL pathway involves a rigorous assessment of late phase II and phase III clinical trial data as well as substantial additional data on safety, efficacy, quality and a risk management plan with a focus on low- and middle-income country needs.
These data are reviewed by independent experts and WHO teams who consider the current body of evidence on the vaccine under consideration, the plans for monitoring its use, and plans for further studies.
As part of the EUL process, the company producing the vaccine must commit to continue to generate data to enable full licensure and WHO prequalification of the vaccine.
The WHO prequalification process will assess additional clinical data generated from vaccine trials and deployment on a rolling basis to ensure the vaccine meets the necessary standards of quality, safety and efficacy for broader availability.
Listings
WHO has already listed the Pfizer/BioNTech, Astrazeneca-SK Bio, Serum Institute of India, Astra Zeneca EU, Janssen, Moderna and Sinopharm vaccines for emergency use.
SAGE
SAGE is the principal advisory group to WHO for vaccines and immunization.
It is charged with advising WHO on overall global policies and strategies, ranging from vaccines and immunization technology, research and development, to delivery of immunization and its linkages with other health interventions.
SAGE is concerned not just with childhood vaccines and immunization, but all vaccine-preventable diseases.
SAGE assesses evidence on safety, efficacy, effectiveness, impact and programmatic suitability, considering both individual and public health impact.
SAGE Interim recommendations for EUL products provide guidance for national vaccination policy makers.
These recommendations are updated as additional evidence becomes available and as there are changes to the epidemiology of disease and the availability of additional vaccines and other disease control interventions.
SAGE has issued recommendations on Pfizer (8 January 2021), Moderna (25 January 2021), AstraZeneca (21 April 2021), Janssen COVID (17 March 2021) and Sinopharm (7 May 2021) vaccines, as well as issued a framework for access and population prioritization roadmap.
The SAGE interim recommendations on Sinovac-CoronaVac are available online as of today.
SAGE and EUL recommendations are complementary but independent processes.
The EUL process is centred on determining if a manufactured product is quality-assured, safe and effective.
SAGE is policy oriented, assessing safety, efficacy, public health impact, and programmatic feasibility.
Policy recommendations for a vaccine are generally made only for those products that have been listed or authorized for use.
In the context of COVID-19 and due the pressing need for vaccines, the Secretariat of SAGE and the EUL team have been working in parallel to allow WHO EUL and policy recommendations, based on the available evidence, to be issued in a synchronized manner.

The President of the Republic of Costa Rica and the Director-General of the World Health Organization call once again on all WHO Member States to actively support the COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP)
Open letter to all WHO Member States
The single most important priority of the global community is to stop the COVID-19 pandemic in its tracks, to halt its rapid transmission and reverse the trend of consequential global distress.
We know that this goal is only achievable when everyone, everywhere can access the health technologies they need for COVID-19 detection, prevention, treatment and response.
This pandemic is far from over, socio-economic inequalities have dramatically increased and lives continue to be lost.
Now more than ever, international cooperation and solidarity are vital to restoring global security, today and for the future.
The world has committed to ensuring universal and equitable access to safe, efficacious and affordable vaccines, medicines and diagnostics.
We are witness to great strides in scientific progress yet a failure to mass produce and share these critical tools will prolong the pandemic, laying the ground for dangerous new variants to emerge and undermine progress made.
During such an unprecedented time, we must deploy and use every tool at our disposal to fight this pandemic and save lives.
One year ago, Costa Rica and the World Health Organization (WHO), with support from 41 Member States, launched the Solidarity Call to Action and the WHO COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP) to improve equitable global access to COVID-19 health technologies through voluntarily pooling knowledge, intellectual property and data to support technology transfer and rapidly expand manufacturing throughout the world in need.
The Solidarity Call to Action calls on key stakeholders and the global community to commit to undertaking specific actions to advance the pooling of knowledge, intellectual property and data for key technologies for the detection, prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
6We called on funders, researchers, governments, and holders of IP and knowledge to support the WHO COVID-19 Technology Access Pool initiative and its relevant implementing partner organizations, in particular through the sharing of intellectual property in a transparent and non-exclusive manner and facilitating technology transfer to multiple quality assured manufacturers.
C­TAP generates worldwide interest as a highly promising initiative; it works inside the patent system and provides a win-win solution for all, beneficiaries and owners of knowledge.
Yet, it remains an underutilized tool.
As a global community we must leverage C-TAP's potential to accommodate different stakeholders and provide timely, sustainable, and effective solutions to promote access and accelerate local production.
That is why we call once again on all Member States to renew and expand our collective commitment in the Solidarity Call to Action and to pro-actively engage with key stakeholders in their territories and encourage IP sharing and technology transfer through C-TAP.
It is our responsibility to ensure a safer world for all, for this generation and for those to come.
His Excellency Mr Carlos Alvarado Quesada, President of the Republic of Costa Rica

WHO supports people quitting tobacco to reduce their risk of severe COVID-19
WHO Director-General Special Awards for World No Tobacco Day announced:
Minister of Health India and University of Bath for exceptional achievement in tobacco control.
Smokers face a 40 – 50% higher risk of developing severe disease and death from COVID-19.
WHO partners with Viber, WhatsApp, FB Messenger, WeChat and AI company Soul Machines to reach billions with free digital quitting tobacco aids.
The World Health Organization’s 'Commit to Quit’ tobacco campaign has made resources from its Quitting Toolkit freely available to more than a billion tobacco users, less than 5 months into the year-long campaign.
WHO launched the campaign to support those millions of tobacco users who are actively taking steps to save their lives, but still need help to succeed.
The campaign is currently working directly with 29 focus countries.
Each country agreed with WHO on selected activities, including, running national awareness campaigns, releasing new digital tools, revising policies, engaging youth, training health workers, opening new cessation clinics, supporting nicotine replacement therapies through WHO partners, establishing national toll-free quit lines, making quitting courses available, and more.
“Smokers have up to a 50% higher risk of developing severe disease and death from COVID-19, so quitting is best thing smokers can do to lower their risk from this coronavirus, as well as the risk of developing cancers, heart disease and respiratory illnesses,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
“We urge all countries to play their part by joining the WHO campaign and creating tobacco-free environments that give people the information, support and tools they need to quit, and quit for good.
“To help tobacco users to commit to be quitters and winners, we are using digital aids to release the WHO Quit Challenge chatbot and Artificial Intelligence digital health worker Florence, and making advocacy material available in 30 languages,” added Dr Rüdiger Krech, Director Health Promotion, WHO.
The Quit Challenge gives daily notifications of tips and encouragement for up to 6 months to help people remain tobacco free.
It is available for free on WhatsApp, Viber, Facebook Messenger and WeChat.
Globally, roughly 39% of men and 9% of women use tobacco.
The highest tobacco use rates among men are currently found in the Western Pacific region at 49%, and among women in Europe at 19%.
Director-General’s Tobacco Control Awards
Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has given special recognition awards for tobacco control to the Minister of Health and Family Welfare of India, Dr Harsh Vardhan and to the Tobacco Control Research Group at the University of Bath, UK.
Dr Harsha Vardhan was instrumental in the 2019 national legislation that bans E-cigarettes and heated tobacco products (HTPs) in India.
The Tobacco Control Research Group in UK has worked relentlessly to expose tobacco industry attempts and tactics to weaken, block or delay tobacco control, thereby helping secure policy change nationally and globally.

COVAX Joint Statement:
Call to action to equip COVAX to deliver 2 billion doses in 2021
Countries that are advanced in their vaccination programmes are seeing cases of COVID-19 decline, hospitalisations decrease and early signs of some kind of normality resume.
However, the global picture is far more concerning.
At no point in this pandemic have we seen such an acute need to look to the future challenges and not rest on the patchy achievements made so far.
We are seeing the traumatic effects of the terrible surge of COVID-19 in South Asia – a surge which has also severely impacted global vaccine supplies.
We are also witnessing why access to vaccines before a surge occurs is so important.
For that reason, we must focus on ensuring countries who have not benefitted from these life-saving tools do so now, and with urgency.
As the global mechanism for equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, COVAX has proven it works.
Designed and implemented in the midst of an unprecedented global public health crisis, it has delivered over 70 million doses to 126 countries and economies around the world since February – from remote islands to conflict settings – managing the largest and most complex rollout of vaccines in history.
\
Over 35 countries received their first COVID-19 vaccine doses thanks to COVAX.
However, the terrible surge of the virus in India has had a severe impact on COVAX’s supply in the second quarter of this year, to the point where, by the end of June we will face a shortfall of 190 million doses.
Even though COVAX will have larger volumes available later in the year through the deals it has already secured with several manufacturers, if we do not address the current, urgent shortfall the consequences could be catastrophic.
But we can meet this challenge with concerted action and global leadership.
Millions of dollars and doses were committed to COVAX on 21 May, bringing the total of doses pledged so far to more than 150 million.
At the World Health Assembly, governments have been united in recognising the political and financial urgency of supporting COVAX with doses and dollars.
It is now imperative to build on this momentum to secure full funding for COVAX and more vaccines – right now – for lower income countries at the Advance Market Commitment Summit on 2 June.
If the world’s leaders rally together, the original COVAX objectives – delivery of 2 billion doses of vaccines worldwide in 2021, and 1.
8 billion doses to 92 lower income economies by early 2022 are still well within reach.
But it will require governments and the private sector to urgently unlock new sources of doses, with deliveries starting in June, and funding so we can deliver.
COVAX has the infrastructure in place to facilitate and coordinate this complex global effort.
To enable COVAX to deliver on the promise of global equitable access, we call for the following immediate actions:
Fund the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC).
The AMC mechanism is how COVAX provides doses to lower income economies.
Thanks to the generosity of its donors, the AMC has already secured 1.
3 billion doses for delivery in 2021.
This is enough to protect the most at-risk population groups: health workers, the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.
We need an additional $2 billion to lift coverage in AMC countries up to nearly 30%, and we need it by June 2 to lock in supplies now so that doses can be delivered through 2021, and into early 2022.
Share doses, now.
The pandemic has just taken a frightening new turn, as a deadly surge of cases rages across South Asia and other hotspots.
Countries with the largest supplies should redirect doses to COVAX now, to have maximum impact.
We are starting to see countries stepping forward with doses, with the United States and Europe collectively pledging to share 180 million doses.
But we still need more, we need them to go through COVAX, and we need them to start moving in early June.
At least one billion doses could be shared by wealthy countries in 2021.
COVAX’s need for doses is greatest right now.
Countries with higher coverage rates, which are due to receive doses soon should swap their places in supply queues with COVAX so that doses can be equitably distributed as quickly as possible.
Free up supply chains by removing trade barriers, export control measures, and other transit issues that block, restrict or slowdown the supply and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, raw materials, components and supplies.
Now more than ever, at the peak of the pandemic, we need ambitious, global solutions.
When it comes to worldwide vaccine distribution, COVAX is the only initiative capable of rising to the challenge of this moment.
It’s understandable that some countries want to press ahead and vaccinate all of their populations.
By donating vaccines to COVAX alongside domestic vaccination programmes, the most at-risk populations can be protected globally, which is instrumental to ending the acute phase of the pandemic, curbing the rise and threat of variants, and accelerating a return to normality.
COVAX is hugely appreciative to France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden and the UAE for their initial commitments to donate doses through COVAX, and to Canada for funding to support the design and operationalization of the COVAX dose sharing mechanism.
We also welcome announcements by the USA, Norway, Croatia, Romania, Australia and Portugal to donate doses to countries in need and we put COVAX forward as the proven mechanism for global, rapid and equitable distribution to facilitate this.
Since COVAX was established in mid-2020, it has had the support and resources of 192 of the world’s economies.
This tremendous vote of confidence has enabled us to demonstrate our ability to deliver an unprecedented global rollout.
It’s time to finish the job.

Notes to editors
The goal of sharing at least 1 billion excess doses by the end of 2021 is based on a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation analysis of current projections of excess doses globally.
Even under conservative estimates, the analysis finds that after sharing 1 billion doses, wealthy countries would have sufficient doses to vaccinate 80% of their populations 12 years and older in 2021.
COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-convened by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) and the World Health Organization (WHO) – working in partnership with UNICEF as key implementing partner, developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers, the World Bank, and others.
Gavi is leading on procurement and delivery at scale for COVAX: coordinating the design, implementation and administration of the COVAX Facility and the Gavi COVAX AMC and working with its Alliance partners UNICEF and WHO, along with governments, on country readiness and delivery.
As part of this role, Gavi hosts the Office of the COVAX Facility to coordinate the operation and governance of the mechanism as a whole, manages relationships with Facility participants, and negotiates advance purchase agreements with manufacturers of promising vaccine candidates to secure doses on behalf of the 190 economies participating in the COVAX Facility.
WHO has multiple roles within COVAX: It provides normative guidance on vaccine policy, regulation, safety, R&D, allocation, and country readiness and delivery.
Along with COVAX partners, WHO has developed a no-fault compensation scheme as part of the time-limited indemnification and liability commitments
It was set up in response to a call from G20 leaders in March and launched by the WHO, European Commission, France and The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in April 2020.
The ACT-Accelerator has four areas of work: diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines and the health system connector.
COVID-19 subcommittee of the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) reviews cases of mild myocarditis reported with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines
The COVID-19 subcommittee of the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) is reviewing reports of a small number of cases of myocarditis reported in individuals vaccinated with the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines.
The subcommittee noted that in most of the reported cases, the individuals have recovered.
The subcommittee is soliciting and monitoring for additional information to assess for any relationship to COVID-19 vaccination.
Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle and pericarditis is an inflammation of the lining that surrounds the heart.
While it can cause serious illness, it is frequently mild and responds well to conservative treatment.
On May 17, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Technical (VaST) Work Group concluded that there are few reports of myocarditis to date and that these cases seem to occur predominantly in adolescents and young adults, more often in males than females, more often after the second dose of the vaccine, and typically within 4 days after vaccination [1].
Most cases appeared to be mild and follow up is ongoing.
The GACVS subcommittee noted that most of the information received so far is based on spontaneous, passive reporting.
More rigorous studies using alternative data sources and more robust study designs including comparison of vaccinated and unvaccinated populations are needed to assess a potential causal association between the event and the vaccine.
Some countries, such as Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States have embarked upon such studies.
The GACVS subcommittee will review further as more data become available.
The subcommittee also underscored the importance of having a harmonized case definition.
A draft case definition for myocarditis has been developed recently by the Brighton Collaboration.
While acknowledging the clear benefits of the mRNA vaccines in reducing deaths and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 infections, the subcommittee encourages all health professionals to report all events of myocarditis and other adverse events observed with these and other vaccines.
The WHO COVID-19 vaccine safety surveillance manual provides guidance to countries on the safety monitoring and adverse events data sharing for the new COVID-19 vaccines.
The GACVS COVID-19 subcommittee will continue to review the safety data from all COVID-19 vaccines and update any advice as necessary.
Open, transparent, and evidence-based communication about the potential benefits and risks to recipients and the community is essential to maintain trust.
WHO is carefully monitoring the rollout of all COVID-19 vaccines and will continue to work closely with countries to manage potential risks, and to use science and data to drive response and recommendations.
G20 leaders boost support of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator but urgent and immediate action is needed to maintain momentum
World leaders today met at the Global Health Summit, co-hosted by the European Commission and Italy as part of its G20 presidency, to adopt an agenda to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic, and develop and endorse a Rome Declaration of principles, at a time when the virus is surging and spreading uncontrollably in many parts of the world.
With nine people losing their lives to COVID-19 every minute, and as the risk of even more transmissible and dangerous variants increases, the Global Health Summit comes at a critical juncture.
The future of the pandemic is in the hands of the G20 leaders.
The ACT-Accelerator was launched just over a year ago in response to the G20’s call for a global mechanism to accelerate the development of tests, treatments and vaccines and to ensure their equitable distribution.
Hosted by the World Health Organization, the ACT-Accelerator offers the only end-to-end multilateral solution to speeding up an end to the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The ACT-Accelerator welcomes the commitments made at the Global Health Summit and will work with countries to operationalize rapidly these pledges, both financial and – crucially – for over 100 million doses of scarce vaccine.
Current financial commitments are reflected in the ACT-Accelerator interactive funding tracker.
However, a significant funding gap remains.
Speeding up an end to the pandemic through the ACT-Accelerator would cost less than 1% of what governments are spending on stimulus packages to treat the consequences of the pandemic.
As the economic and social costs of the pandemic continue to escalate, the case for global solidarity, grows even stronger.
The world now needs the G20 to ACT.
The Rome Declaration, released at the end of the Summit, reaffirmed leaders’ support for the ACT-Accelerator and underlined the necessity to share the financial burden and close the funding gap, in order for the ACT Accelerator to fulfil its mandate for the equitable allocation and delivery of tests, treatments and vaccines to defeat the pandemic.
Of vital importance, the group also emphasized its support for global sharing of vaccine doses approved for emergency use by the World Health Organization (WHO) and through COVAX.
Carl Bildt, Special Envoy for the ACT-Accelerator and former Prime Minister of Sweden, said: “Today’s commitments are welcome – but more action is needed now, not in weeks or months, to change the course of the pandemic.
While some countries have moved beyond just words, by donating vaccines and pledging to fully finance the ACT-Accelerator, further action is needed from G20 and G7 leaders if we are to stop this virus from spreading and mutating further.
We all have substantial work ahead of us.
Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO, said: “We now have an opportunity to fix the global imbalance.
First, we need to close the 18.
5 billion US dollar funding gap for the ACT Accelerator.
Second, we need countries to donate tens of millions of doses of vaccines immediately through COVAX – which is the agreed global mechanism for distributing vaccines.
We welcome the generous announcements made today; in the coming weeks and months, we will need hundreds of millions more doses.
We need companies to help make donations happen fast, and to give COVAX the first right of refusal on all uncommitted doses now, in 2021.
Third, we must urgently and dramatically scale up production of all of these tools, through voluntary licensing, sharing technology and know-how, and waiving intellectual property rights.
We are at a critical juncture.
The creation of the ACT Accelerator represents a historic, forward-thinking effort based on the principles of solidarity and equity.
Let’s seize the moment and finish the job we started.
Today’s commitments come at a critical point in the pandemic.
Only through concerted and rigorous testing to control virus spread, access to life-saving oxygen and dexamethasone to save lives, and vaccines to protect people – can bring this pandemic under control.
A massive disparity in access to tests, treatments and vaccines between the world’s richest and poorest countries is prolonging the pandemic in all parts of the world.
Funding the work of the ACT-Accelerator now would speed up an end to the pandemic everywhere.
Testing rates in high-income countries are 100x the rates in low-income countries, contributing to unmonitored and uncontrolled spread of the virus.
Fully funding the work of the ACT-A Diagnostics Pillar would significantly increase testing in low- and middle-income countries and build sequencing capacity to ensure newly emerging virus variants can be quickly identified and managed.
High-income countries have administered nearly 100x more vaccine doses per inhabitant than low-income countries, leaving millions of healthcare workers and vulnerable populations unprotected in the world’s poorest countries.
Fully funding the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC) and sharing vaccines through ACT-A’s COVAX Facility would protect 27% of the populations in the AMC92 countries by the end of 2021.
The drastic undersupply of oxygen is risking millions of lives across the world.
Fully funding the work of the ACT-A Therapeutics Pillar would save up to 4 million lives with the delivery of life-saving oxygen to those that need it most, and fund research into new treatments to fight the disease.
Health systems are in many countries unprepared for the roll out of COVID-19 tools, and health workers in low- and middle-income countries are frequently unprotected due to lack of PPE.
Fully funding the Health Systems Connector would protect 2 million healthcare workers on the frontlines in LICs with supplies of PPE and help prepare health systems for the roll out of tools to fight COVID-19.
Global solidarity against COVID-19 isn’t just the right thing to do.
It’s the fastest and most effective way to defeat the pandemic and get all our lives and economies back to normal.
-------------------------------------------------
The Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator is the proven, up-and-running global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.
The ACT-Accelerator is not a decision-making body or a new organization but works to speed up collaborative efforts among existing organizations to end the pandemic.
It draws on the experience of leading global health organizations which are tackling the world’s toughest health challenges, and who, by working together, are able to unlock new and more ambitious results against COVID-19.
The ACT-Accelerator comprises four pillars: diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines and health system strengthening.
The diagnostics?
pillar, co-convened by the Global Fund and FIND, is focused on ensuring equitable access to new and existing tests, supporting country uptake and deployment and strengthening the diagnostic portfolio with R&D investments in low-cost, easy-to-use and quality tests.
In 2021, it is focused on procuring and distributing at least 900 million molecular and antigen rapid tests to low- and middle-income countries.
The therapeutics pillar is led by Unitaid and Wellcome.
Therapeutics can play a role in all stages of COVID-19 disease: to prevent infection; suppress symptoms and spread of infection to others; treat or prevent symptoms; as a life-saving treatment for severe symptoms; and as a treatment that can speed up recovery.
The aim in the next 12 months is to develop, manufacture and distribute millions of treatment doses, helping COVID-19 sufferers to recover from the disease.
The vaccines?
pillar, convened by CEPI, Gavi and WHO,?
is speeding up the search for an effective vaccine for all countries.
At the same time, it is supporting the building of manufacturing capabilities, and buying supply, ahead of time so that at least 2 billion doses can be?
fairly distributed to the most high risk and highly exposed populations globally by the end of 2021.
The health systems connector pillar, led by the World Bank, the Global Fund and WHO,?
is working to ensure that these tools can reach the people who need them.
Cross-cutting all of these is the workstream on Access & Allocation, led by WHO.
Since April 2020, the ACT-Accelerator has supported the fastest, most coordinated, and successful global effort in history to develop and rollout tools to fight a new disease.
With significant advances in research and development by academia, private sector and government initiatives, the ACT-Accelerator has advanced our understanding of what works to fight the disease.
It has transformed our ability to tackle COVID-19 on a global scale: vaccines are being rolled-out worldwide, low-cost high-performing antigen rapid diagnostic tests can now detect transmission anywhere, affordable therapies for severe disease can save lives in any setting, and health systems are being strengthened to help roll out these tools.
World Health Assembly to focus on ending COVID-19 pandemic and preparing for next one
In a year when COVID-19 threatens the health and well-being of everyone on the planet, the seventy-fourth session of the World Health Assembly (WHA) will stress the urgency of ending the current pandemic and preventing the next one by building a healthier, safer and fairer world.
The Health Assembly is WHO’s highest decision-making body and is attended by delegations from all around the world.
It will also be open to Associate Members, Observers, invited representatives of the UN and other participating inter-governmental organizations, and non-State actors.
This year’s session will run from 24 May to 1 June 2021, and be held virtually.
Over the past year, cases of COVID-19 rose 40-fold to 162 million globally, while the number of deaths has increased 11 times, to more than 3.
3 million.
The pandemic has hit all countries hard, but its impact has been harshest on those communities which were already vulnerable, who are more exposed to the disease, less likely to have access to quality health care services and more likely to experience adverse consequences (such as loss of income) as a result of measures implemented to contain the pandemic.
“A crisis often brings out the best in people and organisations,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
“From the WHO Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan to our technical guidance, the Solidarity Trial, the UN Supply Chain Task Force, the OpenWHO.
org learning platform and initiatives like the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, including its COVAX partnership, and the Solidarity Response Fund, WHO has given countries effective and evidence-informed tools to prevent infections, save lives and maintain essential health services.
I am especially proud of the incredible work that WHO staff have done all over the world in the past 17 months to support countries to put these tools to work.
But the pandemic is far from over and the global response is at a critical phase.
Stark contrasts still undermine progress, with vaccine inequity being one of the most urgent issues, posing a threat to ending the pandemic and to global recovery – over 75% of all vaccine doses have been administered in only 10 countries; the lowest income countries have administered less than half a percent of global doses.
"This year's World Health Assembly will play a vital role in shaping the global health architecture of the future, and in strengthening WHO to fulfil its mission and mandate", added Dr Tedros.
The Assembly’s agenda will focus on the health-related Sustainable Development Goals and WHO’s Triple Billion targets of one billion more people benefitting from universal health coverage; one billion more better protected from health emergencies; and one billion more enjoying better health and well-being.
WHO’s results report, will also be presented during WHA.
A high-level segment will take place on 24 May (10:00 -12:00 CEST) with participation from Heads of State and Governments and special guests, as well as an address by the WHO Director-General.
The Assembly’s two Committees - Committee A, which deals with predominantly programme and budget matters and Committee B, which deals mainly with administrative, financial and legal matters – will then consider the individual agenda items.
Highlights include:
Proposed programme budget 2022–2023
WHO’s work in Health Emergencies, the COVID-19 response, including mental health preparedness for and response to the COVID-19 pandemic
Global strategy and plan of action on public health, innovation and intellectual property
Global action on patient safety
WHO global strategy on health, environment and climate change
Noncommunicable diseases
Antimicrobial resistance
Immunization Agenda 2030
Health in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
Global Strategic Directions for Nursing and Midwifery
Poliomyelitis
WHO transformation
Three reports on COVID-19 response will be presented at the Assembly: the Health Emergencies Programme’s Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee (IOAC), the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response and the Review Committee on the Functioning of the International Health Regulations (2005) during the COVID-19 Response.
WHO Director-General commends United States decision to support temporary waiver on intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines
WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised the commitment by the United States administration of President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris to support the temporary waiver of intellectual property on COVID-19 vaccines in a bold move to end the pandemic as quickly as possible.
“This is a monumental moment in the fight against COVID-19.
The commitment by the President of the United States Joe Biden and Ambassador Katherine Tai, the US Trade Representative, to support the waiver of IP protections on vaccines is a powerful example of American leadership to address global health challenges,” said Dr Tedros.
“I commend the United States on its historic decision for vaccine equity and prioritizing the well-being of all people everywhere at a critical time.
Now let's all move together swiftly, in solidarity, building on the ingenuity and commitment of scientists who produced life-saving COVID-19 vaccines.
On Wednesday, Ambassador Tai issued a statement saying the extraordinary circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic required extraordinary measures to respond and that the waiving of intellectual property protections on vaccines was needed to help end the pandemic.
The United States would, the statement continued, participate in World Trade Organization negotiations to support the temporary waiving of protections, and work with the private sector and other partners to expand vaccine manufacturing and distribution.
Dr Tedros added: “The White House’s support for the temporary waiving of intellectual property on COVID-19 vaccines reflects the wisdom and moral leadership of the United States to work to end this pandemic.
But I am not surprised by this announcement.
This is what I expected from the Administration of President Biden.
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO has been working with partners to scale up the development and distribution of vaccines, diagnostics and treatments through the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, a pillar of which is the COVAX Facility for the equitable sharing of vaccines to at-risk people worldwide.
WHO welcomes Sweden’s announcement to share COVID-19 vaccine doses with COVAX
WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus welcomed the Government of Sweden’s announcement today to share 1 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine with the COVAX Facility to provide life-saving vaccines to people at risk from COVID-19 in low income countries.
“Sweden’s announcement that it will share 1 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines with COVAX is a superb gesture that must be replicated urgently, and repeatedly, by governments around the world to accelerate the equitable rollout of vaccines globally,” said Dr Tedros, who met today with Sweden’s Minister for Development Cooperation, Mr Per Olsson Fridh, during his visit to WHO’s headquarters in Geneva.
COVAX urgently needs 20 million doses during the second quarter of 2021 to cover interruptions in supply triggered by increased demands for vaccines in India where COVAX’s main supplier of the AstraZeneca product is based.
Dr Tedros added: “Such support will ensure that people in vulnerable countries, especially, in Africa, will be able to receive their second doses through the COVAX initiative.
Sweden’s generous support is very timely as it comes at a time when the world needs it most.
WHO and its partners are advocating for countries to make contributions, like Sweden’s, to donate doses from their stocks to boost vaccine supplies to COVAX to deepen vaccination coverage in low income countries and to ensure populations in such places receive needed second doses.
Several other countries have made similar commitments recently, including New Zealand and France.
Immunization services begin slow recovery from COVID-19 disruptions, though millions of children remain at risk from deadly diseases – WHO, UNICEF, Gavi
Ambitious new global strategy aims to save over 50 million lives through vaccination
While immunization services have started to recover from disruptions caused by COVID-19, millions of children remain vulnerable to deadly diseases, the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance warned today during World Immunization Week, highlighting the urgent need for a renewed global commitment to improve vaccination access and uptake.
“Vaccines will help us end the COVID-19 pandemic but only if we ensure fair access for all countries, and build strong systems to deliver them,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO’s Director-General.
“And if we’re to avoid multiple outbreaks of life-threatening diseases like measles, yellow fever and diphtheria, we must ensure routine vaccination services are protected in every country in the world.
A WHO survey has found that, despite progress when compared to the situation in 2020, more than one third of respondent countries (37%) still report experiencing disruptions to their routine immunization services.
Mass immunization campaigns are also disrupted.
According to new data, 60 of these lifesaving campaigns are currently postponed in 50 countries, putting around 228 million people - mostly children - at risk for diseases such as measles, yellow fever and polio.
Over half of the 50 affected countries are in Africa, highlighting protracted inequities in people’s access to critical immunization services.
Campaigns to immunize against measles, which is one of the most contagious diseases and can result in large outbreaks wherever people are unvaccinated, are the most impacted.
Measles campaigns account for 23 of the postponed campaigns, affecting an estimated 140 million people.
Many have now been delayed for over a year.
“Even before the pandemic, there were worrying signs that we were beginning to lose ground in the fight against preventable child illness, with 20 million children already missing out on critical vaccinations,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director.
“The pandemic has made a bad situation worse, causing millions more children to go unimmunized.
Now that vaccines are at the forefront of everyone’s minds, we must sustain this energy to help every child catch up on their measles, polio and other vaccines.
We have no time to waste.
Lost ground means lost lives.
As a result of gaps in vaccination coverage, serious measles outbreaks have recently been reported in countries including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan and Yemen, while likely to occur elsewhere as growing numbers of children miss out on lifesaving vaccines, the agencies warn.
These outbreaks are happening in places already grappling with conflict situations as well as service disruptions due to ongoing response measures to COVID-19.
The supply of vaccines and other equipment is also essential for child vaccinations.
Due to disruptions at the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic, UNICEF delivered 2.
01 billion vaccine doses in 2020, compared to 2.
29 billion in 2019.
“Millions of children across the world are likely to miss out on basic vaccines as the current pandemic threatens to unravel two decades of progress in routine immunization”, said Dr Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.
“To support the recovery from COVID-19 and to fight future pandemics, we will need to ensure routine immunization is prioritized as we also focus on reaching children who do not receive any routine vaccines, or zero-dose children.
To do this, we need to work together – across development agencies, governments and civil society – to ensure that no child is left behind”.
New global immunization strategy aims to save over 50 million lives
To help tackle these challenges and support the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO UNICEF, Gavi and other partners today launched the Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030), an ambitious new global strategy to maximize the lifesaving impact of vaccines through stronger immunization systems.
The Agenda focuses on vaccination throughout life, from infancy through to adolescence and older age.
If fully implemented, it will avert an estimated 50 million deaths, according to WHO - 75% of them in low- and lower-middle income countries.
Targets to be achieved by 2030 include:
Achieve 90% coverage for essential vaccines given in childhood and adolescence
Halve the number of children completely missing out on vaccines
Complete 500 national or subnational introductions of new or under-utilized vaccines - such as those for COVID-19, rotavirus, or human papillomavirus (HPV)
Urgent action needed from all immunization stakeholders
To achieve IA2030’s ambitious goals, WHO, UNICEF, Gavi and partners are calling for bold action:
World leaders and the global health and development community should make explicit commitments to IA2030 and invest in stronger immunization systems, with tailored approaches for fragile and conflict-affected countries.
Immunization is a vital element of an effective health care system, central to pandemic preparedness and response, and key to preventing the burden of multiple epidemics as societies reopen
All countries should develop and implement ambitious national immunization plans that align with the IA2030 framework, and increase investments to make immunization services accessible to all
Donors and governments should increase investments in vaccine research and innovation, development, and delivery, focused on the needs of underserved populations
The pharmaceutical industry and scientists, working with governments and funders, should continue to accelerate vaccine R&D, ensure a continuous supply of affordable vaccines to meet global needs, and apply lessons from COVID-19 to other diseases
Statement of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization: Continued review of emerging evidence on AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccines
Notification of policy updates
WHO is committed to updating its policy guidance whenever relevant new information has been obtained through the use of the vaccine in populations around the world and new results from clinical research.
Accordingly, new data continues to regularly emerge from ongoing clinical trials and monitoring on the AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine and other vaccines.
On the basis of this additional evidence, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization has updated its interim guidance on the use of the AstraZeneca vaccines against COVID-19 that are produced by different manufacturers (Astra Zeneca-Vaxzevria, Serum Institute India SII Covishield, and SK Bioscience).
WHO continues to support the conclusion that the benefits of these vaccines outweigh the risks.
Pursuant to the latest data, further clarification of precautions and types of risk (ie.
Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome) has been added.
More data have been obtained on the effectiveness of the vaccines in different population groups, such as older adults, making the evidence base more robust.
Clarifications and specifications have been added as to the vaccination of specific population groups (pregnant and lactating women, person with previous SARS-CoV2 infection and others).
The changes to these Interim Recommendations apply to multiple sections of the document.
The updated version is available here.
The SAGE Working Group on COVID-19 Vaccines will continue to evaluate available data and modify the guidance as required.
Statement on the seventh meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee regarding the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic
The seventh meeting of the Emergency Committee convened by the WHO Director-General under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) took place on Thursday, 15 April 2021 from 12:00 to 16:30 Geneva time (CEST).
Proceedings of the meeting
Members and Advisors of the Emergency Committee were convened by videoconference.
The Director-General welcomed the Committee, expressed concern over the continued rise in cases and deaths, and the need to scale up the global vaccination efforts.
He thanked the committee for their continued support and advice.
Representatives of the Office of Legal Counsel (LEG) and the Department of Compliance, Risk Management, and Ethics (CRE) briefed the members on their roles and responsibilities.
The Ethics Officer from CRE provided the Members and Advisers with an overview of the WHO Declaration of Interest process.
The Members and Advisers were made aware of their individual responsibility to disclose to WHO, in a timely manner, any interests of a personal, professional, financial, intellectual or commercial nature that may give rise to a perceived or direct conflict of interest.
They were additionally reminded of their duty to maintain the confidentiality of the meeting discussions and the work of the Committee.
Each member who was present was surveyed and no conflicts of interest were identified.
Two members of the Committee and one advisor who were members of the joint international team participating in the WHO-convened Global Study of Origins of SARS-CoV-2 agreed not to contribute to potential recommendations made by the Committee regarding the investigations concerning the origin and emergence of the virus.
The Secretariat turned the meeting over to the Chair, Professor Didier Houssin.
Professor Houssin also expressed concern over the current trends with the COVID-19 pandemic and reviewed the objectives and agenda of the meeting.
The Secretariat presented on the following topics and responded to questions from the Committee.
Progress made on WHO’s implementation of the 15 January 2021 advice to the Secretariat;
Recent global and regional epidemiological trends, the tracking, monitoring and assessment process for SARS-CoV-2 variants, updates on the mission to understand SARS-CoV-2 origins, and the actions that WHO is taking to ensure a coordinated response to the COVID-19 pandemic;
Global COVID-19 vaccine rollout and equity, the impact of vaccines on asymptotic infection and transmission, and vaccine performance against variants of concern (VOC);
WHO’s assessment of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern on public health interventions; and
An overview of WHO actions related to health measures in relation to international traffic.
The Committee thanked the Secretariat for the quality of the presentations made and unanimously agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic still constitutes an extraordinary event that continues to adversely affect the health of populations around the world, pose a risk of international spread and interference with international traffic, and to require a coordinated international response.
As such, the Committee concurred that the COVID-19 pandemic remains a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) and offered advice to the Director-General.
The Committee noted that many of the past recommendations remain relevant to current global response efforts.
The Committee requests that the IHR Secretariat review past advice and temporary recommendations and bring to the committee a proposal for the process of new issuance, termination, or modification of advice and temporary recommendations in a consistent manner.
The Committee recognized WHO’s and States Parties’ progress in implementing the previous advice and Temporary Recommendations from the 6th meeting of the Emergency Committee.
The Committee congratulated the mission team and the report from the WHO-convened Global Study of Origins of SARS-CoV-2 and encouraged implementation of the recommendations published in the Mission report.
The Committee remains concerned that the world will not exit the pandemic unless, and until, all countries have access to appropriate supplies of diagnostics, treatments and vaccines, irrespective of their ability to pay and the capacity and financial resources to rapidly and effectively vaccinate their populations.
Inequities within and among all countries is slowing the return to normal social and economic life.
The Committee provided the following advice to the Director-General accordingly.
The Director-General determined that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to constitute a PHEIC.
He accepted the advice of the Committee to WHO and issued the Committee’s advice to States Parties as Temporary Recommendations under the IHR.
The Emergency Committee will be reconvened within three months or earlier, at the discretion of the Director-General.
The Director-General thanked the Committee for its work.
Advice to the WHO Secretariat
Promote global solidarity and equitable vaccine access by encouraging States Parties and manufacturers to support the COVAX Facility, including by sharing vaccine doses, and to conduct technology transfer for local production of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies, including in low- and middle-income countries with scalable capacities.
Accelerate evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine candidates, encourage regulatory agencies to use reliance mechanisms, and support States Parties in strengthening their regulatory agencies to facilitate supply of vaccines with assured quality, efficacy, and safety.
Mobilize technical assistance and financial support to States Parties with insufficient capacity and financial resources for vaccine introduction and roll out.
Encourage States Parties to prioritize vaccination of high-risk groups as identified in the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts in Immunization (SAGE) roadmap.
Continue to closely monitor potential vaccine safety signals globally, disseminate timely reports on adverse events following immunization (AEFI), and provide regular SAGE interim recommendations to inform timely national decision-making on the use of COVID-19 vaccines.
Continuously collect and share best practices and lessons learned from COVID-19 vaccination, to guide national, regional, and global decision-making.
Strengthen WHO and support strengthening of States Parties’ capacities to prevent, detect and respond to the growing threat of substandard and falsified vaccines.
Encourage all countries and support low- and middle-income countries to conduct research in line with WHO guidance and best practices.
Research topics include COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and effectiveness with regards to infection, transmission, and disease including due to VOC, duration of protection against disease and asymptomatic infection, long-term protection after using different vaccination intervals, protection after one/two/booster dose schedules, and protection following mixed vaccine product schedules.
Accelerate research to establish correlates of protection from COVID-19 vaccines against infection and disease, including for VOC, thereby facilitating implementation of vaccines and policy development on the use of vaccines.
SARS-CoV-2 Variants
Support States Parties to strengthen their epidemiological and virologic surveillance as part of a comprehensive strategy to control COVID-19.
Provide clear guidance to States Parties for sequencing to monitor virus evolution and encourage broader geographic representative of genetic testing, rapid sharing of sequences, and meta-data with WHO and publicly available platforms.
This will strengthen SARS-CoV-2 evolution monitoring, increase global understanding of variants, and inform decision-making for public health and social measures, diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.
Strengthen the WHO SARS-CoV-2 risk monitoring and assessment framework for variants by accelerating collaboration, harmonizing research to answer critical unknowns about mutations and VOC, and prioritizing issues most relevant for vaccine development, regulatory authorization, and policy formulation, through relevant networks and expert groups such as WHO SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution Working Group, WHO Research and Development Blueprint for Epidemics.
Work with States Parties to conduct in-depth analyses into the factors contributing to the current surge of cases and deaths, including the potential role of SARS-CoV-2 variants.
Health Measures in Relation to International Traffic
Update the WHO December 2020 risk-based guidance for reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission related to international travel (by air, land, and sea) based on current science and best practices that include clear recommendations for testing approaches and traveler quarantine duration, as appropriate.
Incorporate an ethical framework into the updated guidance to guide national decision making.
The guidance should take into consideration COVID-19 vaccination roll out, immunity conferred by past infection, risk settings, movements of migrants, temporary workers, and purpose of travel (non-essential versus essential).
Continue to coordinate with relevant stakeholders in the fields of international travel and transport, including ICAO, UNWTO, and IATA, for the regular review, updating, and dissemination of evidence-based guidance on travel-related risk reduction measures.
Continue to update the WHO interim position on the considerations regarding requirements of proof of vaccination and to produce interim guidance and tools related to standardization of paper and digital documentation of COVID-19 travel-related risk reduction measures (vaccination status, SARS-COV-2 testing and COVID-19 recovery status) in the context of international travel.
Continue to work with States Parties and partners to enable essential travel and repatriation and to facilitate the movement of goods to prevent delays in access to aid and essential supplies.
Continue to encourage vaccination of seafarers and air crews in line with the Joint statement on prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination for seafarers and aircrew.
Origin of SARS-CoV-2
Proceed with rapid implementation of the recommendations in the WHO-convened Global Study of Origins of SARS-CoV-2 report as part of the phase two studies.
Encourage research into the genetic evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
One Health
Promote One Health approaches to better understand and reduce the risk of spill-over of emerging infections from animal to human populations and from humans to animals, including from domestic animals.
Work with partners to develop and disseminate joint risk-based guidance for regulation of wet markets and farms to reduce transmission of novel pathogens from humans to animals and vice-versa.
Risk Communications, Community Engagement, and Risk Management
Provide communications materials and guidance to explain to communities the continued need for a sustained pandemic response; document and provide messaging to respond to pandemic fatigue.
Provide the public with communication materials that outline the relative benefits and risks of vaccinations and therapeutics, explain the need for the continuation of public health and social measures, and dispel misinformation.
Assist States Parties in providing their populations with credible and current information to guide national decision-making by analyzing the latest scientific evidence, sharing evidence-based good practices and experiences, and providing tools and strategies for engaging and understanding community concerns.
Temporary Recommendations to States Parties
Contribute to global solidarity efforts to increase equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies by supporting the COVAX Facility and engaging in technology transfer, where feasible.
Reduce national and global inequities by ensuring vulnerable populations’ access to COVID-19 vaccines and by prioritizing vaccination of high-risk groups in line with the SAGE Roadmap.
In light of currently limited global supply, prioritized vaccination can ensure vaccine supply is available for all countries.
Enhance capacity for COVID-19 vaccination by using the guidance, tools, and trainings for national/subnational focal points and health workers available in the COVID-19 vaccine introduction toolkit.
Incorporate, as necessary and appropriate, the private sector into the COVID-19 vaccine planning and introduction to supplement existing service provision and vaccination capacity.
Share with WHO data and key insights on COVID-19 vaccine uptake and acceptance, wherever possible, and provide the public with credible information on vaccine safety and the benefits of vaccination to address concerns.
Strengthen national vaccine pharmacovigilance systems to identify, report, and respond to vaccine safety signals.
Strengthen epidemiological and virologic surveillance as part of a comprehensive strategy to control COVID-19 and leverage existing systems such as the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) and relevant networks for systematic sharing of data and specimens.
Share sequences and meta-data with WHO and publicly available platforms to strengthen SARS-CoV-2 evolution monitoring, increase global understanding of variants, and inform decision-making for public health and social measures, diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.
Virus sharing, including sharing of VOC, should be undertaken to facilitate evaluation of vaccines against VOC using internationally standardized assays.
Health measures in relation to international traffic
Do not require proof of vaccination as a condition of entry, given the limited (although growing) evidence about the performance of vaccines in reducing transmission and the persistent inequity in the global vaccine distribution.
States Parties are strongly encouraged to acknowledge the potential for requirements of proof of vaccination to deepen inequities and promote differential freedom of movement.
Prioritize vaccination for seafarers and air crews in line with the Joint statement on prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination for seafarers and aircrew.
Special attention should be paid to seafarers who are stranded at sea and who are stopped from crossing international borders for crew change due to travel restrictions, including requirements for proof of COVID-19 vaccination, to ensure that their human rights are respected.
Implement coordinated, time-limited, risk-based, and evidence-based approaches for health measures in relation to international traffic in line with WHO guidance and IHR provisions.
If States Parties implement quarantine measures for international travelers on arrival at their destination, these measures should be based on risk assessments and consider local circumstances.
Reduce the financial burden on international travelers for the measures applied to them for the protection of public health (e.g.testing, isolation/quarantine, and vaccination), in accordance with Article 40 of the IHR.
Share information with WHO on the effects of health measures in minimizing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during international travel to inform WHO’s development of evidence-based guidance.
Strengthen regulation of wet markets and discourage the sale or import of wild animals that pose a high risk of transmission of novel pathogens from animals to humans or vice versa.
Conduct risk-based monitoring of animal populations to reduce disease transmission from animals to humans.
Monitoring efforts should prioritize potential high-risk animal populations that may become reservoirs or lead to emergence of novel viruses or variants.
Origins of SARS-CoV-2
Support global research efforts to better understand critical unknowns about SARS-CoV-2 including the origin of the virus as well as specific mutations, variants, and genetic factors associated with severe disease.
Risk Communications, Community Engagement and Risk Management
Communicate about COVID-19 vaccinations clearly and consistently, including on the benefit-risk of vaccination and on potential AEFI.
It should be clearly communicated that no vaccination is 100% effective and that risk of disease, especially severe disease, is significantly reduced but not eliminated.
Consequently, public health and social measures are still critically needed to prevent infections and control transmission of SARS-CoV-2 while vaccination supplies increase and coverage grows.
Materials should be provided in an easily understandable format and local languages.
Engage and enable communities, the media, and civil society stakeholders in response efforts to reduce pandemic fatigue and enhance vaccine acceptance.
Establish mechanisms to prepare and support health workers and public health authorities as the pandemic is likely to continue for many additional months.
In addition, the following previous recommendations are extended as advised by the Committee.
Extension and Updates of Previous Advice to the WHO Secretariat:
Essential Health Services and Strengthening Health Systems: Work with partners to support States Parties in strengthening their essential health services, with a particular focus on mental health, public health prevention and control systems, and other societal impacts, as well as preparing for and responding to concurrent outbreaks, such as seasonal influenza.
Special attention should continue to be provided to vulnerable settings.
Provide strategic insight on how States Parties can strengthen and sustain their public health infrastructure, capacities, and functions developed for COVID-19 response to support strengthened health systems, emergency preparedness, and universal health coverage in the long-term.
Extension and Updates of Previous Temporary Recommendations to States Parties:
Essential Health Services and Strengthening Health Services: Maintain essential health services with sufficient funding, supplies, and human resources; strengthen health systems to cope with mental health impacts of the pandemic, concurrent disease outbreaks, and other emergencies.
Continue to strengthen public health infrastructure, system capacities, and functions for COVID-19 response, build health systems that can meet health security demands, and to enhance universal health coverage.
WHO-backed global youth mobilization funds young people's ideas to combat impact of COVID-19 pandemic
Initiative led by the world’s six largest youth organizations and supported by the World Health Organization and United Nations Foundation will fund the work of young people in communities impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic
Impact of the global pandemic on young people to be addressed at Global Youth Summit
Young people will decide where the money goes and how it is spent
Global Youth Mobilization backed by UNICEF, USAID, UNFPA, European Commission, Salesforce, FIFA and Heads of State and Governments from around the world
From today, young people around the world will be able to apply for funding to support innovative Local Solutions to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as part of a new initiative called the Global Youth Mobilization.
Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, climate change activist Greta Thunberg and youth representatives from the Global Youth Mobilization will launch the call for applications at a press conference on Monday 19 April 2021 at 1700 CEST.
Led by the Big 6 Youth Organizations and backed by the WHO and United Nations Foundation, the Global Youth Mobilization is an initiative of young people and voluntary organizations taking action to improve their lives now and in a post-COVID-19 world.
Hundreds of millions of young people have had to put their lives on hold because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
90 per cent of young people have reported increased mental anxiety during the pandemic; more than one billion students in almost every country have been impacted by school closures; 80 per cent of young women are worried about their future; and one in six young people worldwide have lost their jobs during the pandemic.
The Global Youth Mobilization Local Solutions funding will by-pass traditional funding and support streams to invest in young people and community grassroots organizations anywhere in the world.
A world first at this scale and level of ambition, young people and community organizations are able to apply for funding via one centralised platform, available in multiple languages.
These local solutions will be judged and decided on by young people, for young people.
Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, said: “WHO is committed to ensuring the voices, energy and solutions offered by youth are at the centre of the world’s recovery from COVID-19.
Our collaboration with the Big 6 and the United Nations Foundation will fuel wide-ranging actions led by young people to address the challenges their own communities face, and will also provide global platforms for their wisdom and ideas to be heard and acted on.
From education disruption and job losses, to a decline in mental health and rising gender-based violence, the Global Youth Mobilization will support young people to overcome the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic.
An initial $2 million of funding will be available in four tiers, from $500 through to $5,000 and an ‘accelerator’ program will scale and replicate the most promising solutions, with further funding lined up over the coming months.
A Global Youth Summit, to be held virtually on 23- 25 April, marks the starting point for young people to get involved in the mobilization.
Over the three days, thousands of young people, leaders, policy makers and changemakers will come together in one space to discuss the issues facing young people across the world.
The mobilization is being supported by Governments, UN agencies and Royal Families including, the Queen of Malaysia, the President of Kenya, President of Ghana, the Vice President of Nigeria, the Government of Fiji, the Prime Minister of Belgium, the Government of Singapore as well as the European Commission, USAID, UNICEF and UN Population Fund.
More details, and further Government support, will be announced at the Global Youth Summit.
The Global Youth Mobilization and its supporters are calling on governments, businesses, and policy makers to back the initiative and commit to prioritising young people in their policies and investing in their futures.
Funded by the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, other supporting global partners include high-profile brands and advocates, including: Salesforce, FIFA, the Special Olympics, UNHCR, Cambridge International, Peace First, Generation Unlimited and Influential.
Dr Tedros will open the Global Youth Summit alongside Youth Representatives of the Global Youth Mobilization Board.
It will feature youth activists from hundreds of countries, three plenary sessions with high-profile speakers, and over 60 interactive breakout sessions involving a range of partners.
The Summit will be available to anyone, via broadcast and in five core languages: English, French, Spanish, Arabic and Russian.
Daisy Moran, Youth Board Representative, Global Youth Mobilization Board, said: “This is a pivotal moment for our generation.
The Global Youth Mobilization provides an opportunity for young people to take an active role in the immediate and long-term recovery from the impact of COVID-19.
Our experiences, creativity and passions will inform policies and decisions affecting all our lives and I urge people to apply for the funding available.
Together, as campaigners, members of youth focused organisations, global health actors, and volunteers from around the world, we are calling for action now.
Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) review of latest evidence of rare adverse blood coagulation events with AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine (Vaxzevria and Covishield)
A very rare new type of adverse event called Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS), involving unusual and severe blood clotting events associated with low platelet counts, has been reported after vaccination with COVID-19 Vaccines Vaxzevria and Covishield.
A specific case definition for TTS is being developed by the Brighton Collaboration1.
This will assist in identifying and evaluating reported TTS events and aid in supporting causality assessments.
The biological mechanism for this syndrome of TTS is still being investigated.
At this stage, a ‘platform specific’ mechanism related to the adenovirus-vectored vaccines is not certain but cannot be excluded.
Ongoing review of TTS cases and related research should include all vaccines using adenoviral vector platforms.
The GACVS noted that an investigation has been initiated into the occurrence of TTS following the Johnson & Johnson vaccine administered in the United States.
The TTS syndrome has not been linked to mRNA-based vaccines (such as Comirnaty or the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine).
Based on latest available data, the risk of TTS with Vaxzevria and Covishield vaccines appears to be very low.
Data from the UK suggest the risk is approximately four cases per million adults (1 case per 250 000) who receive the vaccine, while the rate is estimated to be approximately 1 per 100 000 in the European Union (EU).
Countries assessing the risk of TTS following COVID-19 vaccination should perform a benefit-risk analysis that takes into account local epidemiology (including incidence and mortality from COVID-19 disease), age groups targeted for vaccination and the availability of alternative vaccines.
Work is ongoing to understand risk factors for TTS.
Some investigators have looked into rates of TTS by age2.
GACVS supports further research to understand age-related risk because while available data suggest an increased risk in younger adults, this requires further analysis.
On the issue of sex-related risk, although more cases have been reported in females, it is important to underscore that more women have been vaccinated and that some TTS cases have also been reported in men.
Therefore, further analysis is required to determine any sex-related risk.
GACVS recommends further epidemiological, clinical and mechanistic studies to fully understand TTS.
Thrombosis in specific sites (such as the brain and abdomen) appears to be a key feature of TTS.
Clinicians should be alert to any new, severe, persistent headache or other significant symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain and shortness of breath, with an onset between 4 to 20 days after adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccination.
At a minimum, countries should encourage clinicians to measure platelet levels and conduct appropriate radiological imaging studies as part of the investigation of thrombosis.
Clinicians should also be aware that although heparin is used to treat blood clots in general, administration of heparin in TTS may be dangerous, and alternative treatments such as immunoglobulins and non-heparin anticoagulants should be considered.
There may be a geographic variation in the risk of these rare adverse events.
It is therefore important to evaluate potential cases of TTS in all countries.
Countries are encouraged to review, report and investigate all cases of TTS following COVID-19 vaccinations.
Countries should assess cases according to the presence of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia and the time to onset following vaccination, using the Brighton Case Definition of TTS.
Whilst we have some information on Comirnaty, Moderna (mRNA-1273), Vaxzevria and Covishield vaccines, there is limited post-market surveillance data on other COVID-19 vaccines and from low- and middle-income countries.
GACVS highly recommends that all countries conduct safety surveillance on all COVID-19 vaccines and provide data to their local authorities and to the WHO global database of individual case safety reports.
This is urgently needed to support evidence-based recommendations on these life-saving vaccines.
Interim statement of the COVID-19 subcommittee of the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety on AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine
The COVID-19 subcommittee of the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) has reviewed reports of rare cases of blood clots with low platelets following vaccination with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (including Covishield) since their onset a few weeks ago.
At its most recent meeting on 7 April, 2021, the subcommittee reviewed latest information from the European Medicines Agency along with information from the United Kingdom’s Medicines and other Health products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and other Member States and noted the following:
Based on current information, a causal relationship between the vaccine and the occurrence of blood clots with low platelets is considered plausible but is not confirmed.
Specialised studies are needed to fully understand the potential relationship between vaccination and possible risk factors.
The GACVS subcommittee will continue to gather and review further data, as it has done since the beginning of the COVID vaccine programme.
It is important to note that whilst concerning, the events under assessment are very rare, with low numbers reported among the almost 200 million individuals who have received the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine around the world.
Rare adverse events following immunizations should be assessed against the risk of deaths from COVID-19 disease and the potential of the vaccines to prevent infections and reduce deaths due to diseases.
In this context, it should be noted that as of today, at least 2.
86 million people have died of COVID-19 disease worldwide.
Side effects within two- or three-days following vaccination, the majority of which are mild and local in nature, are expected and common.
However, individuals who experience any severe symptoms – such as shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, persistent abdominal pain, neurological symptoms, such as severe and persistent headaches or blurred vision, tiny blood spots under the skin beyond the site of the injection - from around four to 20 days following vaccination, should seek urgent medical attention.
Clinicians should be aware of relevant case definitions and clinical guidance for patients presenting thrombosis and thrombocytopaenia following COVID-19 vaccination.
To this end, the GACVS subcommittee also suggested that a committee of clinical experts including haematologists and other specialists is convened, for advice on clinical diagnosis and case management.
Active surveillance, including sentinel site / hospital case-based investigations should be considered, to further characterise these rare events.
WHO has developed template protocols that countries could adapt for such studies.
The GACVS will meet again next week to review additional data and will be issuing further recommendations as relevant
In extensive vaccination campaigns, it is normal for countries to identify potential adverse events following immunization.
This does not necessarily mean that the events are linked to vaccination itself, but they must be investigated to ensure that any safety concerns are addressed quickly.
Vaccines, like all medicines, can have side effects.
The administration of vaccines is based on a risk versus benefit analysis.
WHO urges countries to build a fairer, healthier world post-COVID-19
World Health Day 2021
COVID-19 has unfairly impacted some people more harshly than others, exacerbating existing inequities in health and welfare within and between countries.
For World Health Day, 7 April 2021, WHO is therefore issuing five calls for urgent action to improve health for all people.
Within countries, illness and death from COVID-19 have been higher among groups who face discrimination, poverty, social exclusion, and adverse daily living and working conditions - including humanitarian crises.
The pandemic is estimated to have driven between 119 and 124 million more people into extreme poverty last year.
And there is convincing evidence that it has widened gender gaps in employment, with women exiting the labour force in greater numbers than men over the past 12 months.
These inequities in people’s living conditions, health services, and access to power, money and resources are long-standing.
The result: under-5 mortality rates among children from the poorest households are double that of children from the richest households.
Life expectancy for people in low-income countries is 16 years lower than for people in high-income countries.
For example, 9 out of 10 deaths globally from cervical cancer occur in low- and middle-income countries.
But as countries continue to fight the pandemic, a unique opportunity emerges to build back better for a fairer, healthier world by implementing existing commitments, resolutions, and agreements while also making new and bold commitments.
"The COVID-19 pandemic has thrived amid the inequalities in our societies and the gaps in our health systems," says Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
“It is vital for all governments to invest in strengthening their health services and to remove the barriers that prevent so many people from using them, so more people have the chance to live healthy lives.
WHO is therefore issuing five calls for action:
Accelerate equitable access to COVID-19 technologies between and within countries
Safe and effective vaccines have been developed and approved at record speed.
The challenge now is to ensure that they are available to everyone who needs them.
Key here will be additional support to COVAX, the vaccine pillar in the ACT-Accelerator, which hopes to have reached 100 countries and economies in the coming days.
But vaccines alone will not overcome COVID-19.
Commodities such as medical oxygen and personal protective equipment (PPE), as well as reliable diagnostic tests and medicines are also vital.
So are strong mechanisms to fairly distribute all these products within national borders.
The ACT-Accelerator aims to establish testing and treatments for hundreds of millions of people in low and middle-income countries who would otherwise miss out.
But it still requires USD22.
1 billion to deliver these vital tools where they are so desperately needed.
Invest in primary health care
At least half of the world’s population still lacks access to essential health services; more than 800 million people spend at least 10% of their household income on health care, and out of pocket expenses drive almost 100 million people into poverty each year.
As countries move forward post-COVID-19, it will be vital to avoid cuts in public spending on health and other social sectors.
Such cuts are likely to increase hardship among already disadvantaged groups, weaken health system performance, increase health risks, add to fiscal pressure in the future and undermine development gains.
Instead, governments should meet WHO’s recommended target of spending an additional 1% of GDP on primary health care (PHC).
Evidence reveals that PHC-oriented health systems have consistently produced better health outcomes, enhanced equity, and improved efficiency.
Scaling up PHC interventions across low- and middle-income countries could save 60 million lives and increase average life expectancy by 3.
7 years by 2030.
Governments must also reduce the global shortfall of 18 million health workers needed to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) by 2030.
This includes creating at least 10 million additional full-time jobs globally and strengthening gender equality efforts.
Women deliver most of the world’s health and social care, representing up to 70% of all health and care workers, but they are denied equal opportunities to lead it.
Key solutions include equal pay to reduce the gender pay gap and recognizing unpaid health care work by women.
Prioritize health and social protection
In many countries, the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19, through loss of jobs, increases in poverty, disruptions to education, and threats to nutrition, have exceeded the public health impact of the virus.
Some countries have already put in place expanded social protection schemes to mitigate these negative impacts of wider social hardship and started a dialogue on how to continue providing support to the communities and people in the future.
But many face challenges in finding the resources for concrete action.
It will be vital to ensure that these precious investments have the biggest impact on those in greatest need, and that disadvantaged communities are engaged in planning and implementing programmes.
Build safe, healthy and inclusive neighbourhoods
City leaders have often been powerful champions for improving health - for example, by improving transport systems and water and sanitation facilities.
But too often, the lack of basic social services for some communities traps them in a spiral of sickness and insecurity.
Access to healthy housing, in safe neighbourhoods, with adequate educational and recreational amenities, is key to achieving health for all.
Meanwhile, 80 per cent of the world's population living in extreme poverty are in rural areas.
Today, 8 out of 10 people who lack basic drinking water services live in rural areas, as do 7 out of 10 people who lack basic sanitation services.
It will be important to intensify efforts to reach rural communities with health and other basic social services (including water and sanitation).
These communities also urgently need increased economic investment in sustainable livelihoods and better access to digital technologies.
Strengthen data and health information systems
Increasing the availability of timely, high-quality data that is disaggregated by sex, wealth, education, ethnicity, race, gender and place of residence is key to working out where inequities exist, and addressing them.
Health inequality monitoring should be an integral part of all national health information systems.
A recent WHO global assessment shows that only 51% of countries have included data disaggregation in their published national health statistics reports.
The health status of these diverse groups is often masked when national averages are used.
Moreover, it is often those who are made vulnerable, poor or discriminated against, who are the most likely to be missing from the data entirely.
"Now is the time to invest in health as a motor of development," said Dr Tedros.
“We do not need to choose between improving public health, building sustainable societies, ensuring food security and adequate nutrition, tacking climate change and having thriving local economies.
All these vital outcomes go hand in hand.
WHO calls for further studies, data on origin of SARS-CoV-2 virus, reiterates that all hypotheses remain open
The report of the international team on their Wuhan field visit, from 14 January -10 February 2021, was published today as WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for further studies.
The report stems from a Member State resolution adopted by consensus at the World Health Assembly in May 2020 and calling on WHO “to identify the zoonotic source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population, including the possible role of intermediate hosts, including through efforts such as scientific and collaborative field missions.
In remarks to Member States today, Dr Tedros, who received the full report on the weekend, thanked the team for their tireless work.
He said it advances our understanding in important ways, while raising questions that will need to be addressed by further studies, as noted in the report.
“As far as WHO is concerned, all hypotheses remain on the table.
This report is a very important beginning, but it is not the end.
We have not yet found the source of the virus, and we must continue to follow the science and leave no stone unturned as we do,” said Dr Tedros.
“Finding the origin of a virus takes time and we owe it to the world to find the source so we can collectively take steps to reduce the risk of this happening again.
No single research trip can provide all the answers.
The report is available on this webpage:https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/origins-of-the-virus
Below is the full text of the Director-General’s remarks that can be found here: https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-remarks-at-the-member-state-briefing-on-the-report-of-the-international-team-studying-the-origins-of-sars-cov-2
Background information
From the very beginning of the pandemic WHO has stressed the need to understand the origin of the virus in order to better understand the emergence of new pathogens and possible exposures.
Only a few weeks into the outbreak, the IHR Emergency Committee of independent experts recommended that WHO and China pursue efforts to identify the animal source of the virus.
Throughout 2020, WHO continued to discuss with China and other Member States the need to study and share information around the virus origins.
The World Health Assembly resolution of May 2020, which was adopted by all Member States, cited a need “to identify the zoonotic source”:
WHA73.
1 from 19 May 2020: 9.
6) to continue to work closely with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and countries, as part of the One-Health Approach to identify the zoonotic source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population, including the possible role of intermediate hosts, including through efforts such as scientific and collaborative field missions, which will enable targeted interventions and a research agenda to reduce the risk of similar events occurring, as well as to provide guidance on how to prevent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV2) in animals and humans and prevent the establishment of new zoonotic reservoirs, as well as to reduce further risks of emergence and transmission of zoonotic diseases;
In July 2020 WHO sent a small team to China to plan a joint study comprising Chinese and independent international scientists.
It was agreed that WHO would select the international scientists.
The Terms of Reference for the Virus Origins Study were completed by fall 2020.

Global leaders unite in urgent call for international pandemic treaty
25 heads of government and international agencies come together in extraordinary joint call
New treaty would signal high-level political action needed to protect the world from future health crises
The international community should work together “towards a new international treaty for pandemic preparedness and response” to build a more robust global health architecture that will protect future generations, world leaders said in a commentary published today in several newspapers around the world.
“There will be other pandemics and other major health emergencies.
No single government or multilateral agency can address this threat alone,” the leaders say in their article.
“The question is not if, but when.
Together, we must be better prepared to predict, prevent, detect, assess and effectively respond to pandemics in a highly coordinated fashion.
The COVID-19 pandemic has been a stark and painful reminder that nobody is safe until everyone is safe.
The main goal of a new international treaty for pandemic preparedness and response would be to foster a comprehensive, multi-sectoral approach to strengthen national, regional and global capacities and resilience to future pandemics.
This is an opportunity for the world to come together as a global community for peaceful cooperation that extends beyond this crisis.
According to the article, the treaty “would be rooted in the constitution of the World Health Organization, drawing in other relevant organizations key to this endeavour, in support of the principle of health for all.
Existing global health instruments, especially the International Health Regulations, would underpin such a treaty, ensuring a firm and tested foundation on which we can build and improve.
The commentary has been signed by J.V.Bainimarama, Prime Minister of Fiji; Prayut Chan-o-cha, Prime Minister of Thailand; António Luís Santos da Costa, Prime Minister of Portugal; Mario Draghi, Prime Minister of Italy; Klaus Iohannis, President of Romania; Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda; Uhuru Kenyatta, President of Kenya; Emmanuel Macron, President of France; Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany; Charles Michel, President of the European Council; Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Prime Minister of Greece; Moon Jae-in, President of the Republic of Korea; Sebastián Piñera, President of Chile; Andrej Plenkovic, Prime Minister of Croatia; Carlos Alvarado Quesada, President of Costa Rica; Edi Rama, Prime Minister of Albania; Cyril Ramaphosa, President of South Africa; Keith Rowley, Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago; Mark Rutte, Prime Minister of the Netherlands; Kais Saied, President of Tunisia; Macky Sall, President of Senegal; Pedro Sánchez, Prime Minister of Spain; Erna Solberg, Prime Miniser of Norway; Aleksandar Vucic, President of Serbia; Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia; Volodymyr Zelensky, President of Ukraine Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization.
Note to media:
Journalists are invited to attend a virtual conference this morning, Tuesday 30 March, at 10:00 CET (Geneva time), focused on the international pandemic treaty proposal, being held jointly with the President of the European Council, Mr Charles Michel, and WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
COVAX updates participants on delivery delays for vaccines from Serum Institute of India (SII) and AstraZeneca
The COVAX Facility has notified participating economies that deliveries of doses from the Serum Institute of India (SII) will be delayed in March and April
Delays in securing supplies of SII-produced COVID-19 vaccine doses are due to the increased demand for COVID-19 vaccines in IndiaSeparately, participating economies in the COVAX Facility that have been allocated doses from the AstraZeneca manufacturing network have been notified that some first deliveries anticipated in March will now take place in April
Deliveries of COVID-19 vaccines produced by the Serum Institute of India (SII) to lower-income economies participating in the COVAX Facility will face delays during March and April as the Government of India battles a new wave of COVID-19 infections.
COVAX and the Government of India remain in discussions to ensure some supplies are completed during March and April.
According to the agreement between Gavi and the Serum Institute of India (SII), which included funding to support an increase in manufacturing capacity, SII is contracted to provide COVAX with the SII-licensed and manufactured AstraZeneca (AZ)-Oxford vaccine (known as COVISHIELD) to 64 lower-income economies participating in the Gavi COVAX AMC (including India), alongside its commitments to the Government of India.
To date, COVAX has been supplied with 28 million COVISHIELD doses and was expecting an additional 40 million doses to be available in March, and up to 50 million doses in April.
COVAX has notified all affected economies of potential delays.
SII has pledged that, alongside supplying India, it will prioritize the COVAX multilateral solution for equitable distribution.
Participating economies have also received WHO guidance on optimizing the national deployment doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine in a constrained supply environment.
Separately, the COVAX Facility has informed participants allocated AstraZeneca-manufactured doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine that some of the first deliveries due in March are now set to take place in April.
In this early phase of COVID-19 vaccine roll-out, vaccine manufacturers require time to scale and optimize their production processes.
AstraZeneca, which uses a novel supply chain network with sites across multiple continents, is working to enable initial supply to 82 countries through COVAX in the coming weeks.
COVAX retains its objective of supplying initial doses of vaccines to all participating economies in the first half of the year before ramping up significantly in the second half of 2021.
To date, COVAX has shipped vaccines to over 50 countries and economies.
Gavi is leading on procurement and delivery at scale for COVAX: coordinating the design, implementation and administration of the COVAX Facility and the COVAX AMC and working with its Alliance partners UNICEF and WHO, along with governments, on country readiness and delivery.
Joint Statement on prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination for seafarers and aircrew
By International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), International Labour Organization (ILO), International Maritime Organization (IMO), International Organization for Migration (IOM) and World Health Organization (WHO)
The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has triggered devastating consequences for human life and the global economy.
Maritime and air transport are two essential activities that underpin global trade and mobility and are key to a sustainable socio-economic recovery.
More than 80% of global trade by volume is moved by maritime transport.
The global economy depends on the world’s 2 million seafarers who operate the global fleet of merchant ships.
Seafarers have been severely impacted by the travel restrictions imposed during the pandemic.
As of January 2021, it is estimated that some 400,000 seafarers are stranded on board commercial vessels, long past the expiry of their contracts and unable to be repatriated.
A similar number of seafarers urgently need to join ships to replace them.
Passenger air transport carried about 5.
7 billion passengers in 2019 while airfreight represents 35% of the value of goods shipped in all modes combined.
The total number of licensed aviation professionals, which include pilots, air traffic controllers and licensed maintenance technicians, was 887,000 in 2019, according to ICAO personnel statistics.
Application of stringent public health rules to air crew, including quarantine, has resulted in hindered connectivity, operational complexity and significant cost.
Maritime and air transport rely on seafarers and aircrew.
They are key workers required to travel across borders at all times, which may result in the need for them to present proof of a COVID-19 vaccination as a condition for entry in some countries.
This is despite WHO recommendation that, at the present time, countries should not introduce requirements of proof of vaccination for international travel as a condition of entry, as there are still critical unknowns regarding the efficacy of vaccination in reducing transmission and limited availability of vaccines1.
For shipping and air transport to continue to operate safely, the safe cross border movement of seafarers and aircrew must be facilitated.
We reiterate our call upon countries that have not done so to designate seafarers and aircrew as key workers.
With this statement, our organizations also call on governments to prioritize seafarers and aircrew in their national COVID-19 vaccination programmes, together with other essential workers, in accordance with the advice from the WHO SAGE Roadmap for prioritizing the use of COVID-19 vaccines in the context of limited supply published in November 20202.
Seafarers and aircrew need to be protected through vaccination as soon as possible, to facilitate their safe movement across borders.
We also call on governments to identify and prepare for the challenges of COVID-19 vaccination of seafarers and aircrew, particularly for seafarers spending long periods of time away from their home country.
Our organizations fully support the timely development of an international harmonized framework for vaccination certificates, to facilitate international travel for seafarers and aircrew.
In December 2020, WHO established a Smart Vaccination Certificate working group to ensure that digitalized versions of vaccine certificates are interoperable3, and the UN Crisis Management Team for COVID-19, under the leadership of WHO, recognized that all countries should consider seafarers and aircrew, who are required to travel across borders during the pandemic, for essential allocation of vaccines.
We invite governments and other stakeholders to bring the contents of this joint statement to the attention of the competent authorities and all parties concerned.

Statement of the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) COVID-19 subcommittee on safety signals related to the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine
As of 17 March 2021, more than 120 million cases of COVID-19 infections, with more than 2 million deaths, had been reported globally.
Vaccination remains a critical tool to help prevent further illness and death and to control the pandemic.
So far, more than 20 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine have been administered in Europe and more than 27 million doses of the Covishield vaccine (AstraZeneca vaccine by Serum Institute of India) have been administered in India.
The GACVS COVID-19 subcommittee met virtually on 16 and 19 March 2021 to review available information and data on thromboembolic events (blood clots) and thrombocytopenia (low platelets) after vaccination with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.
The subcommittee reviewed clinical trial data and reports based on safety data from Europe, the United Kingdom, India, and Vigibase, the WHO global database of individual case safety reports.
Based on a careful scientific review of the available information, the subcommittee came to the following conclusions and recommendations:
The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (including Covishield) continues to have a positive benefit-risk profile, with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world.
The available data do not suggest any overall increase in clotting conditions such as deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism following administration of COVID-19 vaccines.
Reported rates of thromboembolic events after COVID-19 vaccines are in line with the expected number of diagnoses of these conditions.
Both conditions occur naturally and are not uncommon.
They also occur as a result of COVID-19.
The observed rates have been fewer than expected for such events.
While very rare and unique thromboembolic events in combination with thrombocytopenia, such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), have also been reported following vaccination with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in Europe, it is not certain that they have been caused by vaccination.
The European Medicines Agency’s Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee has reviewed 18 cases of CVST out of a total of more than 20 million vaccinations with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in Europe.
A causal relationship between these rare events has not been established at this time (1).
Adequate education should be provided to health-care professionals and persons being vaccinated to recognize the signs and symptoms of all serious adverse events after vaccinations with all COVID-19 vaccines, so that people may seek and receive prompt and relevant medical care and treatment.
The GACVS subcommittee recommends that countries continue to monitor the safety of all COVID-19 vaccines and promote reporting of suspected adverse events.
The GACVS subcommittee also agrees with the European Medicines Agency’s plans to further investigate and monitor for these events.
The WHO COVID-19 vaccine safety surveillance manual provides guidance to countries on the safety monitoring and adverse events data sharing for the new COVID-19 vaccines, and can be accessed here.

WHO statement on AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine safety signals
Some countries in the European Union have temporarily suspended use of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine as a precautionary measure based on reports of rare blood coagulation disorders in persons who had received the vaccine.
Other countries in the EU – having considered the same information - have decided to continue using the vaccine in their immunization programmes.
Vaccination against COVID-19 will not reduce illness or deaths from other causes.
Thromboembolic events are known to occur frequently.
Venous thromboembolism is the third most common cardiovascular disease globally.
In extensive vaccination campaigns, it is routine for countries to signal potential adverse events following immunization.
This does not necessarily mean that the events are linked to vaccination itself, but it is good practice to investigate them.
It also shows that the surveillance system works and that effective controls are in place.
WHO is in regular contact with the European Medicines Agency and regulators around the world for the latest information on COVID-19 vaccine safety.
The WHO COVID-19 Subcommittee of the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety is carefully assessing the latest available safety data for the AstraZeneca vaccine.
Once that review is completed, WHO will immediately communicate the findings to the public.
At this time, WHO considers that the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh its risks and recommends that vaccinations continue.
New research highlights risks of separating newborns from mothers during COVID-19 pandemic
Keeping mothers and babies together could save more than 125 000 lives: WHO
New research from WHO and partners shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is severely affecting the quality of care given to small and sick newborns, resulting in unnecessary suffering and deaths.
A study published in the Lancet EclinicalMedicine highlights the critical importance of ensuring newborn babies have close contact with parents after birth, especially for those born too small (at low birthweight) or too soon (preterm).
However, in many countries, if COVID-19 infections are confirmed or suspected, newborn babies are being routinely separated from their mothers, putting them at higher risk of death and lifelong health complications.
This is especially the case in the poorest countries where the greatest number of preterm births and infant deaths occur.
According to the report, disruptions to kangaroo mother care – which involves close contact between a parent, usually a mother, and a newborn baby - will worsen these risks.
Up to 125 000 babies’ lives could be saved with full coverage of kangaroo mother care.
For babies born preterm or at low birthweight, kangaroo mother care (early, prolonged skin-to-skin contact with a parent and exclusive breastfeeding) is particularly critical.
Among infants born preterm or at low birthweight, kangaroo mother care has been shown to reduce infant deaths by as much as 40%, hypothermia by more than 70%, and severe infections by 65%.
“Disruptions to essential health services during COVID-19 have severely affected the quality of care provided to some of the most vulnerable babies, and this includes their right to the lifesaving contact they need with their parents,” said Dr Anshu Banerjee, Director for Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health and Ageing at WHO.
“Decades of progress in reducing child deaths will be jeopardized unless we act now to protect and improve quality care services for mothers and newborns, and expand coverage of lifesaving interventions like kangaroo mother care.
WHO advises that mothers should continue to share a room with their babies from birth and be able to breastfeed and practice skin-to-skin contact – even when COVID-19 infections are suspected or confirmed - and should be supported to ensure appropriate infection prevention practices.
“Much more attention is needed to ensure health practitioners and policymakers globally are aware of the need to keep mothers and babies together in these critical early days, especially for babies born too small or too soon,” said Queen Dube, Director of Health at the Ministry of Health in Malawi, one of the report authors.
“Kangaroo Mother Care is one of our most cost-effective ways to protect small and sick newborns.
According to our analysis, these risks by far outweigh the small chance of a newborn baby getting severe disease from COVID-19.
“Kangaroo mother care is among the best interventions to improve a premature or low birthweight baby’s chances of survival, especially in low-income countries,” she added.
Evidence suggests that disruptions to kangaroo mother care may already be worryingly widespread.
A systematic review of 20 clinical guidelines from 17 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic found that one-third recommended separation of mothers and newborns if the mother has or may have COVID-19.
In a global survey of thousands of neonatal healthcare providers, published today in a related paper in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) Global Health, two-thirds of health workers in 62 countries reported they do not allow mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 to practice routine skin to skin contact, while nearly one-quarter did not allow breastfeeding, even by uninfected caregivers.
Studies have reported mainly no symptoms or mild disease from COVID-19 in infected newborns, with low risk of neonatal death.
This new study estimates that the risk of newborns catching COVID-19 would result in fewer than 2000 deaths.
However, infection during pregnancy may result in increased risk of preterm birth, which means it is even more important to ensure the right care is given to support preterm babies and their parents during the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to the most recent estimates, 15 million babies are born preterm (before 37 weeks) each year and 21 million are born at low birthweight (under 2.
5kg).
These babies face significant health risks including disabilities, developmental delays and infections, while prematurity-related complications are the leading causes of death of newborns and children under 5.

COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund marks first anniversary and appeals for continued support
The fund has raised more than US$ 242 million from more than 661 000 individuals, corporations, and other organizations to support WHO and partners’ global COVID-19 response.
The fund helps WHO to deploy lifesaving supplies, information and research to countries across the globe.
An additional US$ 1.
96 billion is needed for WHO in 2021 to continue coordinating global pandemic response, more than 60% will go towards requirements for the Access to COVID-19 tools, including diagnostics, treatments and vaccines.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One year ago WHO created the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund to respond to the unprecedented show of support by individuals and companies to help WHO in the fight against COVID-19.
Powered by the UN Foundation and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation, it was developed as an innovative platform to enable private companies, individuals and other organizations to contribute directly to WHO’s efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to COVID-19 around the world.
The fund’s first year has seen unprecedented solidarity: to date, more than 661 000 donors have contributed nearly US$ 250 million.
The funds have be used to provide millions of frontline workers with critical personal protective equipment, medical supplies, and testing kits; to manage misinformation and the infodemic; support vulnerable populations like refugees and displaced persons; and helped accelerate the research on vaccines, tests, and treatments.
“I sincerely thank every individual, corporation and other organization for their donations to the Solidarity Response Fund,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
“Your generosity has made a difference.
On the fund’s one-year anniversary, we have seen what we can accomplish together in times of need”.
The Solidarity Response Fund has been a critical source of funding for the WHO’s overall response.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, WHO has shipped nearly 250 million items of personal protective equipment and vital medical supplies including oxygen across more than 150 countries, strengthened hundreds of national and subnational laboratories with technical support, supplied more than 250 million COVID-19 tests; coordinated the deployment of more than 180 teams across the world; and supported more than 12 000 intensive care beds in health systems that might otherwise have been overwhelmed.
Despite this progress, current trends show that the fight is far from over.
That’s why today the fund launches a renewed call for action for funds to contribute to the estimated US$ 1.
96 billion required by WHO in 2021 to respond to remaining and new challenges in the fight against COVID-19.
Contributions to the next phase of the fund will support the efforts of WHO and its partners to continue to suppress transmission, reduce exposure, counter misinformation, protect the vulnerable, reduce mortality and morbidity and accelerate equitable access to new COVID-19 tools – including through WHO’s work with the ACT-Accelerator, to scale up vaccination globally, particularly for the most vulnerable countries, and ensure the delivery of life-saving supplies.
The recently launched WHO Foundation will lead the next phase of the Solidarity Response Fund to support the continuing fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, working in collaboration with the United Nations Foundation and a global network of fiduciary partners.
“The COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund galvanized an astonishing outpouring of global generosity beyond anything we have seen before.
We put all the resources of the UN Foundation behind this task and were overwhelmed by the global response that enabled us to get critical funds to the most urgent needs in the devastating first year of the pandemic.
The Solidarity Response Fund is a true testament to the power of collective action, and what can be achieved when people from every sector and every corner of the world act together to respond to overcome a collective threat,” said Elizabeth Cousens, President and CEO of the UN Foundation.
Launched in May 2020, the WHO Foundation is an independent grant-making organization that supports WHO’s efforts to address urgent global health challenges.
“COVID-19 has affected all of us.
Every country.
Every company.
Every community.
It was inspiring to see the world rally behind the WHO last year in the form of hundreds of thousands of contributions to its Solidarity Response Fund.
That money was put to good use and saved countless lives," said Anil Soni, CEO of the WHO Foundation.
"I am committed to maintaining the success of the Fund as a vehicle for individuals and corporations to power the global fight against COVID-19.
This pandemic won't be over anywhere until it's over everywhere, and donations to the Solidarity Response Fund help move the world towards that goal.
The COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP), and accompanying guidelines, issued in February 2021, fully articulates the basis for WHO’s appeal.
The document guides coordinated action that WHO must take at national, regional, and global levels to overcome the ongoing challenges in the response to COVID-19, address inequities, and plot a course beyond the pandemic.
“We have achieved so much over the past year.
Unfortunately, the pandemic is far from over and we can’t give up the fight yet.
WHO adds Janssen vaccine to list of safe and effective emergency tools against COVID-19
The World Health Organization (WHO) today listed the COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.
COV2.
S, developed by Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), for emergency use in all countries and for COVAX roll-out.
The decision comes on the back of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) authorization, which was announced yesterday.
“Every new, safe and effective tool against COVID-19 is another step closer to controlling the pandemic,” said WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
“But the hope offered by these tools will not materialize unless they are made available to all people in all countries.
I urge governments and companies to live up to their commitments and to use all solutions at their disposal to ramp up production so that these tools become truly global public goods, available and affordable to all, and a shared solution to the global crisis.
The vaccine from Janssen is the first to be listed by WHO as a single dose regimen, which should facilitate vaccination logistics in all countries.
The ample data from large clinical trials shared by the company also shows that the vaccine is effective in older populations.
To expedite listing of the vaccine, WHO and a team of assessors from all regions adopted what is called an ‘abbreviated assessment’ based on outcomes of the EMA review, and evaluation of quality, safety and efficacy data focused on low- and middle-income country needs.
The WHO assessment also considered suitability requirements such as cold chain storage and risk management plans to be implemented in countries.
While the vaccine needs to be stored at -20 degrees, which may prove challenging in some environments, it can be kept for three months at 2-8°C and it has a long shelf life of two years.
WHO will convene its Strategic Advisory Group on Immunization Experts next week to formulate recommendations on use of the vaccine.
In the meantime, WHO continues to work with countries and COVAX partners to prepare for roll-out and safety monitoring.
The COVAX Facility has booked 500 million doses of the vaccine.
The EUL pathway involves a rigorous assessment of late phase II and phase III clinical trial data as well as substantial additional data on safety, efficacy, quality and a risk management plan.
WHO has also listed the Pfizer/BioNTech, Astrazeneca-SK Bio and Serum Institute of India vaccines for emergency use.
We thank you for your contributions and seek your continued support to beat COVID-19. added Dr Tedros.

GACVS COVID-19 Vaccine Safety subcommittee meeting to review reports on influenza-like illness in individuals vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines
The GACVS COVID-19 Subcommittee met virtually on Thursday, 25 February 2021, to review available information and data on reports of influenza-like illness in health-care workers who had received COVID-19 vaccines.
These symptoms have been reported in several countries.
The Subcommittee reviewed clinical trial data and a summary of reports of influenza-like illness following vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines in the WHO global Individual Case Safety Reports database (VigiBase).
The Subcommittee noted that similar symptoms of influenza-like illness had also been reported in the first few days following vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines in clinical trials.
These included headache, fatigue, muscle aches, feverishness and chills.
Most symptoms were mild to moderate and resolved within a few days.
These expected side effects from vaccination were more common in younger vaccine recipients (under the age of 55 years) compared with older people.
Based on a careful scientific review of the information made available, the Subcommittee came to the following conclusions:
Symptoms of an influenza-like illness may be expected as immune responses following vaccinations in general.
The current reports with the COVID-19 vaccines are consistent with the expected side-effect profile of these vaccines, all of which were well tolerated.
In view of this, the committee considers that the benefit-risk balance of the COVID-19 vaccines (for which reports of the influenza-like reactions are available to date) remains favourable and does not suggest any revision, at present, to the recommendations around the safety of these vaccines.
The committee recommends that people who are vaccinated be informed, prior to vaccination, of the potential for influenza-like symptoms to occur after receipt of COVID-19 vaccines.
Such symptoms should be managed accordingly, with medical advice sought if required.
The occurrence of transient symptoms such as headache, fever and muscle aches after a first dose of these vaccines should not prevent administration of the second dose.
The potential for short-term adverse events following vaccination should be considered when planning the timing of vaccination for healthcare teams or other workers covering a specific service area.
All countries should continue to monitor the safety of vaccines and promote routine after-care following immunization, consistent with good immunization practices for any vaccine.
The committee recommends that data on suspected adverse events should be collected and reviewed continuously – nationally, regionally, and globally – as the COVID-19 vaccines are rolled out, world-wide, in order to ensure their continuing positive benefit risk balance.
The GACVS subcommittee will continue to review the safety data from all COVID-19 vaccines and update any advice as necessary.
At the time of this review, the WHO global Individual Case Safety Reports database, Vigibase, included reports of influenza-like illness following vaccinations with NRVV Ad (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) (AZ), Tozinameran (Pfizer), mRNA 1273 (Moderna), COVID-19 vaccine inact (Vero) CZ02 (Sinovac) vaccines.
WHO will continue to monitor for potential reports of similar events following other COVID-19 vaccines.
COVAX publishes first round of allocations
The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) and the World Health Organization (WHO), as co-leads of the COVAX initiative for equitable global access to COVID-19 vaccines, alongside key delivery partner UNICEF, are pleased to publish COVAX’s first round of allocations.
Following from the publication of an interim distribution forecast, and based on current knowledge of supply availability, this first round of allocations provides information on provision of doses of the AstraZeneca(AZ)/Oxford vaccine to COVAX Facility participants, through May 2021.
This first round of allocation outlines delivery of doses of the AZ/Oxford vaccine – manufactured by AstraZeneca (AZ) and COVISHIELD, licensed to and manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII/AZ) – to Facility participants.
Participants not listed have either exercised their rights to opt-out of this vaccine, wish to transfer allocated doses to AMC participants, are AMC-eligible but have not joined the AMC, have voluntarily delayed receipt of doses and communicated this intent ahead of allocation, or have not met financial requirements.
This list will be updated by the end of the week to provide indicative timelines for the supply of these doses, split into Feb-March and April-May.
These timelines are dependent on a variety of factors including national regulatory requirements, availability of supply, and fulfilment of other criteria such as validated national deployment and vaccination plans (NDVPs) from AMC participants, indemnification & liability agreements, and export and import authorisations.
Deliveries for this round of allocations has already begun, with India, Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire receiving doses of the SII/AZ vaccine.
Both Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire began vaccination campaigns utilising these doses on Monday.
Further deliveries are underway for this week, and as readiness criteria are fulfilled and doses become available, will continue on a rolling basis over the coming months.
In addition to this first round of allocations, an exceptional distribution of 1.
2 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, anticipated for delivery in Q1 2021, was announced in early February.
Further allocation rounds for vaccines in the COVAX portfolio will be announced in due course.
The list of first round allocations is available here.
Note to editors
COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance Gavi) and the World Health Organization (WHO) – working in partnership with developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers, UNICEF, the World Bank, and others.
CEPI is focused on the COVAX vaccine research and development portfolio:investing in R&D across a variety of promising candidates, with the goal to support development of three safe and effective vaccines which can be made available to countries participating in the COVAX Facility.
Gavi is focused on procurement and delivery for COVAX: coordinating the design, implementation and administration of the COVAX Facility and the Gavi COVAX AMC and working with its Alliance partners UNICEF and WHO, along with governments, on country readiness and delivery.
The COVAX Facility is the global pooled procurement mechanism for COVID-19 vaccines through which COVAX will ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines for all 190 participating economies, using an allocation framework formulated by WHO.
The COVAX Facility will do this by pooling buying power from participating economies and providing volume guarantees across a range of promising vaccine candidates.
The Gavi COVAX AMC is the financing mechanism that will support the participation of 92 low- and middle-income countries in the Facility, enabling access to donor-funded doses of safe and effective vaccines.
Gavi is fundraising for the COVAX AMC, and funding UNICEF procurement of vaccines as well as partners’ and governments work on readiness and delivery, including support cold chain equipment, technical assistance, syringes, vehicles, and other aspects of the vastly complex logistical operation for delivery.
UNICEF and the Pan-American Health Organisation (PAHO) will be acting as procurement coordinators for the COVAX Facility, helping deliver vaccines to COVAX AMC participants and others.
Its Emergency Use Listing (EUL)/prequalification programmes ensure harmonized review and authorization across member states.
Along with Gavi and numerous other partners working at the global, regional, and country level, the CRD workstream provides tools, guidance, monitoring, and on the ground technical assistance for the planning and roll-out of the vaccines.
UNICEF already procures more than 2 billion doses of vaccines annually for routine immunization and outbreak response on behalf of nearly 100 countries.

First COVID-19 COVAX vaccine doses administered in Africa
Today, the governments of Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana began COVID-19 vaccination campaigns aimed at protecting healthcare workers.
This week’s first vaccinations happen as a further 11 million COVAX doses are expected to be delivered over the next seven days.
Publication of the allocation of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine to 142 of COVAX’s participating economies, to be delivered between now and the end of May, is anticipated tomorrow.
As the global rollout of COVAX vaccines accelerates, the first COVID-19 vaccination campaigns in Africa using COVAX doses began today in Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire.
These campaigns are the among the first to use doses provided by the COVAX Facility’s Gavi COVAX Advanced Market Commitment (AMC).
The AMC is the COVAX Facility’s mechanism to provide donor-funded vaccines to lower-income countries.
The campaigns in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire follow deliveries to both countries last week with Ghana taking delivery of 600 000 doses on February 24 and Côte d’Ivoire 504 000 doses two days later.
Both countries received the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine licensed and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII).
The vaccine, branded COVISHIELD, was granted Emergency Use Listing (EUL) by the World Health Organization on 15 February.
H.
E.
Nana Akufo-Addo, President of the Republic of Ghana said: "COVID-19 has changed the world.
It has cost lives, battered health systems, and damaged livelihoods.
But, through these challenges, we have seen the best of humanity exemplified through strong multilateral cooperation.
Ghana welcomes the arrival of the first doses of COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX AMC as a pathway to ending the acute phase of the pandemic.
To maximise the public health benefit of the vaccine, the first doses will be prioritized for health and essential workers, and other at-risk groups.
This important milestone will allow Ghana to get back to business, and build back our economy even stronger than before.
The deliveries mark the start of what will be the largest, most rapid and complex global rollout of vaccines in history.
In total, COVAX aims to deliver at least 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2021, including at least 1.
3 billion to the 92 economies eligible for support through the COVAX AMC.
Confirmation of first-round allocations, covering the majority of the COVAX Facility participants, will be published 2 March 2021.
COVAX doses to date have been delivered by SII to India, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, while Pfizer-BioNTech has delivered doses to the Republic of Korea.
More deliveries by these two manufacturers are planned in the coming days, with 11 million doses in total planned to be delivered over the next seven days.
In addition, AstraZeneca is set to commence shipments this week.
COVAX, the overarching effort to accelerate development and access to COVID vaccines, is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the World Health Organization (WHO) working in partnership with UNICEF as well as the World Bank, manufacturers and civil society organizations, and others.
"This is a day many of us have been dreaming of and working for more than 12 months," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
"It's gratifying to see the fruit of that labour.
But success is still to come.
This is only the beginning of what COVAX was set up to achieve.
We have a lot left to do to realize our vision to start vaccination in all countries within the first 100 days of the year.
There are just 40 days left.
“As vaccination begins in Côte D’Ivoire, less than a year after COVID-19 was characterized as a global pandemic, I am filled with confidence, and I am sure that through COVAX and international solidarity we will be able to reach the most at-risk everywhere.
Global equitable access to life-saving vaccines is the surest way to save lives and rebuild economies.
I would like to thank all donors and also the leadership of the G7 group of nations.
Nowadays vaccine policy is the best economic policy,” said José Manuel Barroso, Chair of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.
“The last year has been a dark one for families all over the world, but the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines provided a hopeful light at the end of the tunnel.
Today, the COVAX Facility begins to make good on its promise to make sure that light shines for all,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director.
“This unprecedented global effort has rallied the international community behind identifying acceptable vaccines, raising funds to procure them, and laying the groundwork for the world’s largest immunization campaign in history.
Now, these vaccines are quickly reaching people in low and middle-income countries, many of which would have been left behind without the Facility’s work.
This proves what we can accomplish when we all – the private sector, UN and development agencies, governments, donors, and other partners – work as one.
“This is a historic day in the global fight against COVID-19.
Today’s vaccinations in Cote d’Ivoire and Ghana are among the first to be delivered through COVAX, which will protect many hundreds of millions of those most at risk from COVID-19, wherever they are in the world.
said Dr Richard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI.
“In the coming days and weeks, COVAX will begin to redress the global imbalance in vaccine deployment, but there is still much to do.
The spread of new COVID-19 variants means global access to vaccines is more important than ever before, and the global community must remain firmly focused on this goal if we are to bring the pandemic to an end.
The start of Africa’s biggest immunization drive in history through the COVAX Facility marks a step forward in the continent’s fight against COVID-19.
It is a welcome shift towards bringing African countries off the sidelines and back into the vaccination race, correcting the glaring inequity which has been an unfortunate hallmark of the global vaccine rollout to date.
For months WHO teams in the region and partners have been supporting countries to plan and prepare for the complex challenges of such a massive vaccination campaign.
We now look forward to seeing these plans put into action with an effective and efficient vaccine rollout,” Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.
“The first COVAX vaccine deliveries in West and Central Africa were a huge first step towards equity and a demonstration of global solidarity,” said UNICEF Regional Director for West and Central Africa Marie-Pierre Poirier.
“A few days after the vaccine doses landed, we are already celebrating the first COVID-19 vaccination campaigns, starting today in Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire, aimed at protecting the most vulnerable.
We are proud that countries in West and Central Africa were ready from the get-go.
UNICEF is active on the ground, together with WHO and other partners, to support the roll-out of the vaccination campaigns until everyone is safe.
“
Quotes from partners and donors
President Ursula von der Leyen, European Commission said: “To overcome coronavirus, vaccines must reach all corners of the planet, as soon as possible.
I am delighted that we now have tangible results on the ground.
I want to pay tribute to the tireless efforts of our partners, Gavi, CEPI, WHO and UNICEF.
Team Europe is a proud supporter of COVAX and will continue to stand by the people of Africa.
Karina Gould, Minister of International Development, Government of Canada and Gavi COVAX AMC co-chair said: “Today is yet again proof of what can be achieved through international collaboration.
We have reached another milestone in the global vaccination effort, with the first COVAX vaccines being administered in Cote d’Ivoire.
Canada is committed to helping everyone, everywhere recover from the pandemic, and also, to strengthening health systems.
Norwegian Minister of International Development and co-chair of ACT-A facilitation council Dag-Inge Ulstein said: “The progress on vaccines is impressive and, as a major funder to the ACT Accelerator, we believe in the need for the multilateral approach which is clearly working.
As co-chair of the ACT Accelerator Facilitation Council, we urgently need to see the same traction in tests, treatments and health systems.
Funding is needed to support this now; we have a small window of opportunity with the evolving context of the pandemic -new variants, limited vaccine supply, and underinvestment in global solutions means we cannot be complacent.
The Minister of Health in Saudi Arabia, Dr Tawfig AlRabiah said: “Saudi Arabia’s contribution to this historic moment reaffirms our commitment to the principles of ACT-A; equitable access to various pandemic tools, leaving no one behind.
Adar Poonawalla, CEO, Serum Institute of India (SII) said: "We are delighted to play a part in vaccinating the world through COVAX.
We will continue to work towards providing equitable access to vaccines.
Sai D.
Prasad, President, Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturer’s Network (DCVMN) said: “Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturer’s Network has strongly stood with all stakeholders during this unprecedented time of COVID-19 pandemic and has strived hard to develop, manufacture and roll out COVID-19 vaccines in a record time span of 10-12 months as a part of global collaboration and solidarity.
We stand together shoulder to shoulder in this endeavour.
Thomas Cueni, Director General, International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) said: “Since the beginning of this pandemic, vaccine makers have spared no efforts to speed up development, production, registration, and equitable access to of high-quality vaccines.
Pharmaceutical manufacturers are committed founding partners of ACT-Accelerator and COVAX, and we are excited that for the first time in the history of pandemics vaccines are rolled out in a coordinated manner quickly around the world.
Another momentous effort, is the scaling up of the vaccine manufacturing from zero to millions in a matter of months.
As producing vaccines is a complex process, so with such a scale up, there are inevitably going to be challenges ahead; we will continue working collaboratively to find solutions and join hands in making history.
COVID-19 response review in the Republic of Moldova informs next steps
The Republic of Moldova is among the first countries in the WHO European Region to conduct a COVID-19 intra-action review (IAR).
This exercise, requested by the Republic of Moldova’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Social Protection, has enabled the documentation of best practices and challenges, and has yielded recommendations for the ongoing response to the pandemic.
The first cases of COVID-19 were reported by the Republic of Moldova on 8 March 2020.
Since then, the Government has responded with a number of public health and social measures to curb transmission of the virus.
The IAR findings will be utilized to adjust and synchronize further public health measures in the country.
Best practices and challenges outlined
“The IAR exercise was an excellent opportunity for the Republic of Moldova to share experiences and collectively analyse its response to COVID-19 by identifying challenges and best practices,” said Mr Constantin Rîmi?
Secretary of State of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Social Protection.
“We had 3.
5 full working days of debating and analysing, building consensus, and finding the ways forward.
Like other countries across the world who are putting in place measures to control the spread of COVID-19, the Republic of Moldova has faced many challenges, and I’m sure that the IAR will contribute to improving management of the national pandemic response,” he added.
The IAR covered all core areas of the country’s COVID-19 response: risk communication and community engagement; case investigation and contact tracing; the national laboratory system; infection prevention and control; case management; knowledge sharing about innovations and the latest research; and essential health services maintenance during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Broad participation across government
The IAR was attended by representatives of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Social Protection, the National Public Health Agency, the State University of Medicine and Pharmacy “Nicolae Testemianu”, the Border Police, the Civil Aviation Authority, and the General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations.
Nearly 80 participants from key national and local institutions participated in both face-to-face and online discussions.
The COVID-19 response review was led jointly by a large team of national experts and experts from all levels of WHO.
“Through an interactive and structured workshop, the institutions and specialists from the Republic of Moldova involved in the COVID-19 response openly reflected on the work done and collectively acknowledged areas in need of improvement to further strengthen the response,” highlighted Dr Igor Pokanevych, WHO Representative to the Republic of Moldova.
About intra-action reviews
WHO’s COVID-19 response review is a country-led, facilitated process that brings together a group of COVID-19 responders with knowledge of the public health response pillars under review.
The IAR is meant to identify practical areas for immediate remediation and for sustained improvement of the ongoing response.
Republic of Moldova prepares for COVID-19 vaccine deployment
24 February 2021 News release the Republic of Moldova Reading time: 1 min (367 words)
An unprecedented readiness drill was conducted in the Republic of Moldova in preparation for the arrival of the first shipment of COVID-19 vaccines.
The drill was organized by the national health authorities with support from WHO, in anticipation of the country’s first delivery of vaccines through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility.
According to the National Plan for COVID-19 vaccine rollout, the Republic of Moldova aims to make vaccines available to at least 70% of the population.
Through the COVAX Facility, the country has secured enough doses to cover about 1.
7 million people, which represents half of its population.
20% of the total number of doses will be covered via the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment.
This innovative financing instrument enables access to donor-funded doses of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, a third of which will be purchased through cost-sharing at preferential prices.
Detailed simulation as a readiness check
The simulation exercise (SimEX) was led by the National COVID-19 Immunization Focal Point team, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Social Protection and the National Agency for Public Health.
The goal of the exercise was to test the system’s readiness for COVID-19 vaccine deployment and to identify the strengths and potential challenges that might affect vaccine delivery.
The exercise began at the Chisinau International Airport, using a special transportation freezer, and ran through scenarios for COVID-19 vaccine reception, distribution and administration.
The next step was to deliver the vaccines to the National Vaccine Warehouse located on the premises of the National Agency for Public Health, a central institution responsible for vaccine reception and distribution at the national level.
“An effectively managed supply chain is crucial for successful deployment of COVID-19 vaccines.
To achieve this, deployment readiness exercises were conducted at all levels during transportation, storage and distribution,” said Dr Igor Pokanevych, WHO Representative in the Republic of Moldova.
The exercise is a component of the comprehensive operational support provided by WHO to countries in the WHO European Region to ensure they are fully prepared for the delivery, deployment and administration of COVID-19 vaccines.
The final readiness checks, including simulation exercises, have been initiated in countries designated to receive vaccines through the COVAX Facility in the coming weeks.
No-fault compensation programme for COVID-19 vaccines is a world first
New programme makes compensation available to eligible individuals in 92 low- and middle-income countries without need to resort to law courts
This is the first and only global vaccine injury compensation mechanism
The programme is funded by a small levy on each dose supported by the Gavi COVAX AMC
The World Health Organization (WHO) and Chubb Limited (NYSE: CB), through ESIS Inc.,a Chubb company, signed an agreement on behalf of the COVAX Facility on 17 February 2021 for the administration of a no-fault compensation programme for the 92 low- and middle-income countries and economies eligible for support via the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC) of the COVAX Facility.
As the first and only vaccine injury compensation mechanism operating on an international scale, the programme will offer eligible individuals in AMC-eligible countries and economies a fast, fair, robust and transparent process to receive compensation for rare but serious adverse events associated with COVAX-distributed vaccines until 30 June 2022.
By providing a no-fault lump-sum compensation in full and final settlement of any claims, the COVAX programme aims to significantly reduce the need for recourse to the law courts, a potentially lengthy and costly process.
ESIS, as the independent administrator of the programme, was selected in accordance with WHO’s procurement rules and procedures, and charges no fees to applicants.
All vaccines procured or distributed through the COVAX Facility receive regulatory approval or an emergency use authorization to confirm their safety and efficacy.
But, as with all medicines, even vaccines that are approved for general use may, in rare cases, cause serious adverse reactions.
“The unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic has been matched by the largest ever rollout of new vaccines under the ACT-Accelerator and its vaccines pillar, COVAX.
This no-fault compensation mechanism helps to ensure that people in AMC-eligible countries and economies can benefit from the cutting-edge science that has delivered COVID-19 vaccines in record time,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
“We are pleased to be collaborating with Chubb, which has the capabilities to support the COVAX facility through its global network and claims handling ability.
WHO’s agreement with Chubb offers further protection and confidence in the life-saving power of vaccines.
“The No-Fault Compensation fund is a massive boost for COVAX’s goal of equitable global access to vaccines: by providing a robust, transparent and independent mechanism to settle serious adverse events it helps those in countries who might have such effects, manufacturers to roll out vaccines to countries faster, and is a key benefit for lower-income governments procuring vaccines through the Gavi COVAX AMC,” said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi.
The COVAX no-fault compensation programme will be operationalized through its web portal (www.covaxclaims.com) by 31 March 2021, which will include resources such as the programme’s protocol, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and information on how to submit an application.
Eligible individuals may apply for compensation under the programme once the portal becomes operational, even if a COVAX-distributed vaccine is administered to them before 31 March 2021.
The programme is financed initially through Gavi COVAX AMC donor funding, calculated as a levy charged on all doses of COVID-19 vaccines distributed through the COVAX Facility to the AMC eligible economies until 30 June 2022.
WHO is working with Chubb to secure insurance coverage for the programme with Chubb as lead insurer.
“Chubb is proud and honoured to work with the World Health Organization and its partners on the critically important COVAX programme,” said Evan G.
Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chubb.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating effect on people and economies around the globe, and the development and deployment of efficacious vaccines is a crucial step toward ending this crisis.
However, a vaccination strategy is only as effective as the number of people it reaches, which is why the COVAX facility is so critical.
Access to the protection offered by a vaccine should not be limited or restricted.
All countries, regardless of income levels, should have equal access to these life-saving vaccines.
The delivery of COVID-19 vaccines during 2021 will be the fastest and largest global deployment of novel vaccines in history.
The COVAX Facility aims, by the end of 2021, to deliver at least 2 billion doses of safe, effective and quality-assured vaccines to all participating countries, including at least 1.
3 billion doses to the 92 AMC-eligible countries and economies, at the same time as wealthier nations.
WHO Director-General's statement on Tanzania and COVID-19
We extend our condolences to our Tanzanian sisters and brothers on the recent passing of a senior Tanzanian leader as well as the government’s Chief Secretary.
In late January, I joined Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Director for the African Region, in urging Tanzania to scale public health measures against COVID-19 and to prepare for vaccination.
I also encouraged the sharing of data in light of reports of COVID-19 cases among travellers.
Since then I have spoken with several authorities in Tanzania but WHO is yet to receive any information regarding what measures Tanzania is taking to respond to the pandemic.
This situation remains very concerning.
I renew my call for Tanzania to start reporting COVID-19 cases and share data.
I also call on Tanzania to implement the public health measures that we know work in breaking the chains of transmission, and to prepare for vaccination.
A number of Tanzanians travelling to neighbouring countries and beyond have tested positive for COVID-19.
This underscores the need for Tanzania to take robust action both to safeguard their own people and protect populations in these countries and beyond.
COVID-19 is a serious disease that can cause severe illness and even death.
National authorities everywhere must do all they can to protect people and save lives and WHO stands ready to support them in the response against this deadly virus.
WHO lists two additional COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use and COVAX roll-out
AstraZeneca/Oxford-developed vaccines to reach countries in the coming weeks
Today WHO listed two versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, giving the green light for these vaccines to be rolled out globally through COVAX.
The vaccines are produced by AstraZeneca-SKBio (Republic of Korea) and the Serum Institute of India.
WHO’s Emergency Use Listing (EUL) assesses the quality, safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and is a prerequisite for COVAX Facility vaccine supply.
“Countries with no access to vaccines to date will finally be able to start vaccinating their health workers and populations at risk, contributing to the COVAX Facility’s goal of equitable vaccine distribution,” said Dr Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Medicines and Health Products.
‘But we must keep up the pressure to meet the needs of priority populations everywhere and facilitate global access.
To do that, we need two things – a scale-up of manufacturing capacity, and developers’ early submission of their vaccines for WHO review.
The WHO EUL process can be carried out quickly when vaccine developers submit the full data required by WHO in a timely manner.
Once those data are submitted, WHO can rapidly assemble its evaluation team and regulators from around the world to assess the information and, when necessary, carry out inspections of manufacturing sites.
In the case of the two AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccines, WHO assessed the quality, safety and efficacy data, risk management plans and programmatic suitability, such as cold chain requirements.
The process took under four weeks.
The vaccine was reviewed on 8 February by WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), which makes recommendations for vaccines’ use in populations (i.
e.
recommended age groups, intervals between shots, advice for specific groups such as pregnant and lactating women).
The SAGE recommended the vaccine for all age groups 18 and above.
The AstraZeneca/Oxford product is a viral vectored vaccine called ChAdOx1-S [recombinant].
It is being produced at several manufacturing sites, as well as in the Republic of Korea and India.
ChAdOx1-S has been found to have 63.
09% efficacy and is suitable for low- and middle-income countries due to easy storage requirements.
WHO also listed the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for emergency use on 31 December 2020.
WHO recomendation AstraZeneca/SKBio - COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant])
WHO recommendation Serum Institute of India Pvt Ltd - COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]) - COVISHIELD™
COVAX Statement on New Variants of SARS-CoV-2
The emergence of variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, serve as a powerful reminder that viruses by their very nature mutate, and that the scientific response may need to adapt if they are to remain effective against them.
In light of recent news stories regarding the preliminary data on minimal effectiveness of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine at preventing mild to moderate COVID-19 disease caused by the viral variant B.
351, it is important to note that primary analysis of data from Phase III trials has so far shown – in the context of viral settings without this variant – that the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine offers protection against severe disease, hospitalisation and death.
This means it is vitally important now to determine the vaccine’s effectiveness when it comes to preventing more severe illness caused by the B.
351 variant.
Additional studies will also allow us to confirm the optimal vaccination schedule and its impact on vaccine efficacy.
CEPI has announced funding for additional clinical research to optimize and extend the use of existing vaccines, which could include "mix-and-match" studies of different vaccines used in combinations that may improve the quality and strength of the immune response.
Such studies could be useful in optimizing the use of available vaccines, including the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine.
The WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) convened today to review evidence on the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, including emerging evidence on performance against viral variants, and to consider the demonstrated impact of the product and the risk-benefit assessment for use cases with limited data.
These recommendations for use of the AstraZeneca product are being finalised and will be presented to the WHO Director-General on 9 Feb 2021.
Even though this recent news on effectiveness of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine against the B.
351 variant is based on a limited study size which focused on low-risk participants and used interval doses that were not optimized for immunogenicity, these results confirm we must do everything possible to reduce the circulation of the virus, prevent infections and reduce the opportunities for the SARS-CoV-2 to evolve resulting in mutations that may reduce the efficacy of existing vaccines.
This means that additionally:
Manufacturers must be prepared to adjust to the SARS-CoV-2 viral evolution, including potentially providing future booster shots and adapted vaccines, if found to be scientifically necessary.
Trials must be designed and maintained to allow any changes in efficacy to be assessed, and to be of sufficient scale and diversity to enable clear interpretation of results.
Enhanced genomic surveillance must be backed by rapid sharing of genetic and meta-data to allow for global coordination and response.
Priority should be given to vaccinating high-risk groups everywhere in order to ensure maximum global protection against new strains and minimize the risk of transmission.
Governments and donors, as well as development banks, should further support COVAX in order to ensure equitable access and delivery, as well as meet ongoing research and development costs for next-generation vaccines.
WHO is enhancing an existing mechanism for tracking and evaluating variants that may affect vaccine composition and expanding that mechanism to provide guidance to manufacturers and countries on changes that may be needed for vaccines.
COVAX was set up to ensure global equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines.
With the world’s largest actively managed portfolio of COVID-19 vaccine candidates, the COVAX Facility offers its self-financing participants and those eligible for support through the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment access to a diverse range of vaccine candidates, suitable for a broad range of contexts and settings.
The ability to deploy vaccines globally to address the evolving pandemic is more critical than ever, as is the importance of coordination to ensure we do not put the impact and value of vaccines at risk.
If new vaccines are required, ensuring global access to these is even more essential, as we continue to see that we are all safe only if everyone is safe.
With regards to the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, COVAX has signed advance purchase agreements with AstraZeneca and Serum Institute of India and has published plans to distribute nearly 350 million doses in the first half of the year.
We expect a decision this month from WHO on whether the vaccines will be granted emergency use listing (EUL) as well as a SAGE recommendation on its optimal use.
Should EUL be forthcoming, we expect the vaccine to play a key role in our effort to protect high risk persons and to help end the acute phase of the pandemic.

Bloomberg and Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus call for global focus on noncommunicable diseases to save lives from COVID-19
In recognition of Bloomberg’s contributions in improving public health, WHO confirms his third term as WHO Global Ambassador
Bloomberg, Founder, Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg Philanthropies, today joined Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, in calling for urgent action to tackle noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) like diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, cancer and respiratory diseases, which account for over 74% of deaths globally and worsen outcomes of patients with COVID-19.
This comes as WHO confirms that Bloomberg will continue for a third term as WHO Global Ambassador for Noncommunicable Diseases and Injuries.
His WHO Ambassador role follows decades of involvement in health policy, including his three terms as mayor of New York City, and a long-standing collaboration with WHO to take on some of the biggest global health challenges.
In his role, Bloomberg will continue to raise awareness about the link between COVID-19 and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), advocate for investment in measures to tackle NCDs and injuries, mobilize cities for better health, and support the use of health data to drive programs and policies.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the full danger of noncommunicable diseases – and signaled the urgent need for stronger public health policies and investment to prevent them,” said Dr Tedros.
“We urge world leaders in business and government to take aggressive steps to prevent noncommunicable diseases.
Fewer NCDs would have meant fewer deaths during the pandemic.
“The majority of those who have died from COVID-19 had an underlying noncommunicable disease, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease or cancer.
NCDs account for nearly three-quarters of all deaths around the world, and the scale and urgency of the problem was thrown into sharp relief by COVID-19.
NCDs can be prevented, and we know what works,” said Michael R.
Bloomberg, WHO Global Ambassador for Noncommunicable Diseases and Injuries.
“Bloomberg Philanthropies has been working with WHO to reduce tobacco use, support healthier diets, fight cardiovascular disease, and strengthen health data to guide our work.
We look forward to expanding our efforts to help more cities and countries take action on NCDs and to save lives.
NCDs currently kill over 40 million people every year.
These chronic conditions have also increased the death toll from COVID-19, which has already taken over two million lives.
People who are obese, who use tobacco, and who have hypertension are at increased risk of being hospitalized and dying from COVID-19.
In addition to COVID-19, Bloomberg’s work with WHO and investments more broadly in public health focus on major, life-saving initiatives to reduce tobacco and youth e-cigarette use, support healthy food policy, reduce drowning, and improve road safety and maternal health, among others.
In 2017, Bloomberg Philanthropies partnered with WHO and Vital Strategies to launch the Partnership for Healthy Cities, a network of 70 global cities, covering nearly 300 million people, committed to preventing NCDs and injuries since 2017.
Over the past year, it has expanded its support to urban leaders around the world to include the resources and tools to overcome the challenges of the pandemic.
After more than 15 years of collaboration, WHO and Bloomberg Philanthropies have shared major achievements across public health:
5 billion people covered by at least one strong tobacco control measure
3 billion people have benefitted from stronger road safety laws
70 cities covering almost 300 million people, committed to preventing NCDs and injuries
Countries around the world have been supported to strengthen their health data systems through the Data for Health Program.
The newly released SCORE Report is the first to gauge countries’ progress in producing sustainable health data.
WHO and Bloomberg Philanthropies will continue to drive change in tobacco control, prevention of noncommunicable diseases, road safety, injuries and improving health data.
Later this year, in partnership with Bloomberg Philanthropies, WHO will launch a new “NCD investment case” outlining the value of investing in policies and interventions to prevent NCDs.
COVAX publishes first interim distribution forecast
The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the World Health Organization, as co-leads of the COVAX initiative for equitable global access to COVID-19 vaccines, alongside key delivery partner UNICEF, are pleased to publish COVAX’s first interim distribution forecast.
Building on the publication of the 2021 COVAX global and regional supply forecast, the interim distribution forecast provides information on early projected availability of doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in Q1 2021 and the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine candidate in first half 2021 to COVAX Facility participants.
This announcement comes less than two weeks after the announcement of the signed advance purchase agreement with Pfizer/BioNTech and a little more than a month after the first COVID-19 vaccine received WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL).
The purpose of sharing the interim distribution with countries, even in today’s highly dynamic global supply environment, is to provide governments and health systems with the information they need to plan for their national vaccination programmes.
Final allocations will be published in due course.
The interim distribution forecast outlines projected delivery of vaccine doses to all Facility participants, with the exception of participants who have either exercised their rights to opt-out, have not submitted vaccine requests, or have not yet been allocated doses.
The interim distribution forecast is available here.

FIFA and WHO #ACTogether to tackle COVID-19
Star footballers, competing team captains will promote equitable global access to vaccines, treatments and diagnostics
Monday 1 February 2021, Geneva: FIFA is teaming up with the World Health Organization (WHO) to promote the need for fair access to COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and diagnostics, and to encourage people to keep practicing life-saving, everyday public health measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and to protect health.
In conjunction with the FIFA Club World Cup 2020, being held in Qatar from 4 to 11 February 2021, FIFA and WHO are launching a public awareness campaign involving star footballers, through TV and in-stadium messaging, to further promote the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator initiative launched in April 2020, and to urge people to practice mask wearing, physical distancing and hand hygiene.
“We all have to play our part in the battle against the coronavirus.
We are also calling on the international community to #ACTogether to ensure a level playing field in relation to access to vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests across the globe,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said during a video conference prior to the kick-off of the FIFA Club World Cup.
Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, thanked FIFA and the players for helping raise awareness on life saving interventions that all people can follow, and of the importance of intensified global support for the ACT Accelerator to ramp up development and equitable allocation of vaccines, treatments and tests to reduce severe disease and deaths caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
“Fairness is the foundation of football and all other sports, and this also must be the same when it comes to health,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
“The rules of the COVID-19 challenge are simple: all people at risk from the coronavirus in all countries must have equitable access to life-saving vaccines, treatments and diagnostics.
In just nine months, the world has established these three powerful lines of defense against COVID-19.
But our goal now is to ensure equitable access and continued refinement of these tools.
Dr Tedros added: “WHO is grateful to FIFA for teaming up with health partners around the world to promote the need for the fair distribution of the tools needed to defeat the coronavirus.
The new FIFA-WHO collaboration will amplify life-saving messages to a global audience with a series of promotional videos being broadcast during the FIFA Club World Cup.
In the videos, competing club captains reiterate the key steps for everyone to follow in order to tackle and defeat the coronavirus by focusing on hands, elbow, face, distance, symptoms, masks and opening windows.
“It is important that we do not forget that health comes first,” said the FIFA President.
“Only by following the advice of our medical professionals will we be able to eliminate the threat posed by COVID-19, and I call upon everyone to follow these steps in their daily lives.
This advice not only protects you, but also protects your loved ones and those around you.
In delivering these messages during the FIFA Club World Cup, I appreciate the support given by the participating teams and their players, coaching staff and other officials in respecting the protocols that need to be followed in order to play this tournament, and to ensure that we keep the football flame flickering brightly during these challenging times.
The video awareness campaign will feature players and head coaches from the competing teams at the FIFA Club World Cup Qatar 2020 together with FIFA Legends, and will be published on various FIFA, WHO and club digital channels, with the support of broadcasters worldwide.

Editors notes:
WHO and FIFA signed a four-year collaboration in 2019 to promote healthy lifestyles through football globally.
More information on the WHO-FIFA memorandum of understanding can be found here.
The two organisations jointly launched the “Pass the message to kick out coronavirus” campaign in March 2020 to share advice on effective measures to protect people from COVID-19.
This was followed by the #BeActive campaign in April 2020 to encourage people to stay healthy at home during the pandemic.
Subsequently, the global #SafeHome campaign was published in May 2020 to support women and children at risk of domestic violence, and was followed by additional follow-up messaging in August and November 2020.
Update hyperlinks per language (or remove link if information is not available in that language)
In April 2020, WHO and partners launched the Access to COVID-19 (ACT) Accelerator initiative to support what has become the fastest, most coordinated, and successful global effort in history to develop tools to fight a disease.
Its goal is to end the pandemic as quickly as possible by reducing COVID-19 death and severe disease through the accelerated development, equitable allocation, and scaled-up delivery of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics to reduce mortality and severe disease.
The financing gap for the ACT-Accelerator for 2021 is US$26 billion, a fraction of the projected global economic cost of up to US$9.
2 trillion if governments do not ensure developing economies have equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.
GACVS COVID-19 Vaccine Safety subcommittee meeting to review reports of deaths of very frail elderly individuals vaccinated with Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162b2
The GACVS COVID-19 Vaccine Safety subcommittee met virtually on Tuesday, 19 January 2021, to review available information and data on deaths reported in frail, elderly individuals who had received the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, BNT162b2 (hereafter, BNT162b2).
Experts invited from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Uppsala Monitoring Center (UMC) provided an overview of deaths reported in Europe and in the WHO global database (VigiBase) following vaccination with BNT162b2.
Based on a careful scientific review of the information made available, the subcommittee came to the following conclusions:
The current reports do not suggest any unexpected or untoward increase in fatalities in frail, elderly individuals or any unusual characteristics of adverse events following administration of BNT162b2.
Reports are in line with the expected, all-cause mortality rates and causes of death in the sub-population of frail, elderly individuals, and the available information does not confirm a contributory role for the vaccine in the reported fatal events.
In view of this, the committee considers that the benefit-risk balance of BNT162b2 remains favourable in the elderly, and does not suggest any revision, at present, to the recommendations around the safety of this vaccine.
Countries should continue to monitor the safety of vaccines, and promote routine after-care following immunization, consistent with good immunization practices for any vaccine.
The committee recommends that data on suspected adverse events should be collected and reviewed continuously - nationally, regionally, and globally - as the COVID-19 vaccines are rolled out, world-wide.
The GACVS subcommittee will continue to monitor the safety data from these vaccines and update any advice as necessary.
Statement on the sixth meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee regarding the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic
The sixth meeting of the Emergency Committee convened by the WHO Director-General under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) took place on Thursday, 14 January 2021 from 12:15 to 16:45 Geneva time (CEST).
The Director-General welcomed the Committee, expressed the need for global solidarity in addressing the challenges posed by the pandemic, and emphasized the need for protection of the most vulnerable.
He thanked the Committee for their continued support and advice.
Representatives of the legal department and the Department of Compliance, Risk Management, and Ethics (CRE) briefed the members on their roles and responsibilities.
Professor Houssin also welcomed the Committee and reviewed the objectives and agenda of the meeting.
The WHO Director of the Health Emergency Information and Risk Assessment Department provided an overview of the evolution of the pandemic and the progress made on the implementation of the 30 October 2020 Temporary Recommendations.
WHO continues to monitor the global risk level of the COVID-19 pandemic.
WHO assessed the global risk level as very high due, in part, to recent reports of new SARS-CoV-2 variants.
A representative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland presented on the new SARS-CoV-2 variant which is causing increased transmission but not severity of COVID-19.
A representative of Denmark presented on the SARS-CoV-2 mink variants and their response which has resulted in these variants no longer circulating in human populations.
The WHO Technical Lead for COVID-19 Response and an Emergency Committee Member from South Africa provided an overview of the variant detected by South Africa.
The WHO Technical Lead then shared a global overview of SARS-CoV-2 mutations and variants as well as plans to develop and implement standard nomenclature for variants that does not reference a geographical location.
The WHO Director of the Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals Department presented the current status of the COVID-19 vaccine landscape and introduction.
The Chair of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) noted available guidance including WHO SAGE Roadmap for Prioritizing Uses of COVID-19 Vaccines in the Context of Limited Supply and the Interim Recommendations for Use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (BNT162b2) under Emergency Use Listing.
The Director of Air Transport Bureau of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) shared their COVID-19 activities related to testing and vaccination, including the Manual on Testing and Cross Border Risk Management Measures (Doc 10152) which provides countries with risk management strategies for international travel.
The WHO Unit Head of the IHR Secretariat provided an overview of the legal provisions as well as the scientific, ethical and technological considerations for vaccination certificates related to international travel.
The Committee recognized the challenges posed by some manufacturers’ delayed submission of vaccine data to WHO.
These data delays impact WHO’s ability to provide emergency use listing which ultimately affect equitable vaccine access.
The Committee strongly encourages manufacturers to provide data to WHO as rapidly as possible.
The Committee unanimously agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic still constitutes an extraordinary event, a public health risk to other States through international spread, and continues to require a coordinated international response.
The Committee recognized WHO’s and States Parties’ progress in implementing the previous Temporary Recommendations from the 5th meeting of the Emergency Committee.
The Committee noted that these recommendations remain relevant and had acquired additional urgency given the evolution of the pandemic and the continued need for a coordinated global response.
The Committee advised on extending the previous Temporary Recommendations and provided additional advice to the Director-General.
The Emergency Committee will be reconvened within three months, at the discretion of the Director-General.
Continue to work with partners to develop standardized definitions and nomenclature of SARS-CoV-2 virus variants, based on their genetic sequence, that avoids stigmatization and is geographically and politically neutral.
Provide clear information to State Parties on what constitutes a variant of concern.
Continue to increase worldwide capacities for SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing and genetic sequencing, in line with WHO guidance, and encourage rapid sharing of sequences and meta-data to strengthen monitoring of virus evolution and to increase global understanding of variants and their effects on vaccine, therapeutics and diagnostic efficacy.
Strengthen the SARS-CoV-2 risk monitoring framework for variants by accelerating collaboration and harmonizing research to answer critical unknowns about specific mutations and variants, through relevant networks and expert groups such as WHO SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution Working Group and the WHO R&D Blueprint for Epidemics.
COVID-19 Vaccines
Accelerate research on critical unknowns about COVID-19 vaccination efficacy on transmission, duration of protection against severe disease and asymptomatic infection, duration of immunity (following infection or vaccination), long-term protection after using different vaccination intervals, protection after a single dose, and vaccination regimes, in line with the SAGE and the Research and Development Blueprint recommendations.
Promote global solidarity and equitable vaccine access by encouraging States Parties and manufacturers to donate resources and provide support to the COVAX Facility.
Promote technology transfer to low- and middle- income countries with the potential capacity to accelerate global production of COVID-19 vaccines.
Support State Parties, including fragile states, in preparing for COVID-19 vaccine introduction by developing a national deployment and vaccination plan, in line with WHO guidance, that addresses barriers to COVID-19 vaccine readiness.
Such planning should include prioritization of populations, regulatory authorization, supply and logistics preparation, indemnification and liability, health workforce planning, and access for humanitarian and vulnerable population.
Lead development of risk-based international standards and guidance for reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission related to international travel (by air, land, and sea) based on current science and good practices that include clear recommendations for testing approaches and quarantine duration as appropriate.
The guidance should additionally include advice on adapting those measure to specific risk settings, including movements of migrants, temporary workers, travellers and conveyance operators.
Rapidly develop and disseminate the WHO policy position on the legal, ethical, scientific, and technological considerations related to requirements for proof of COVID-19 vaccination for international travelers, in accordance with relevant IHR provisions.
Coordinate with relevant stakeholders the development of standards for digital documentation of COVID-19 travel-related risk reduction measures ,that can be implemented on interoperable digital platforms.
This should include vaccination status in preparation for widespread vaccine access.
Encourage States Parties to implement coordinated, time-limited, risk-based, and evidence-based approaches for health measures in relation to international travel.
Evidence-Based Response Strategies
Continue to rapidly provide and regularly update evidence-based advice; guidance; tools; and resources, including regular dissemination of resources to combat misinformation for COVID-19, to enhance evidence-based COVID-19 preparedness and response strategies and implementation of such strategies.
Surveillance
Continue to actively support countries to further strengthen their SARS-CoV-2 surveillance systems, including strategic use of genetic sequencing, by leveraging existing systems such as the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) and relevant networks for systematic sharing of data and specimens.
Strengthening Health Systems
Provide strategic insight on how State Parties can sustain the public health infrastructure, capacities, and functions developed for COVID-19 response to support strengthened health systems and universal health coverage in the long-term.
Additional Temporary Recommendations to State Parties
Increase molecular testing and genetic sequencing and share sequences and meta-data with WHO and through publicly accessible databases to enhance global understanding of the virus evolution and inform response efforts.
Support coordinated global research efforts to better understand critical unknowns about SARS-CoV-2 specific mutations and variants.
Engage in technology transfer to accelerate global production and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies.
Prepare for COVID-19 vaccine introduction and post-introduction evaluation using the guidance, tools, and trainings for national/subnational focal points and health workers developed by the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator’s Country Readiness and Delivery workstream.
Encourage and facilitate vaccine acceptance and uptake by providing credible information on vaccine safety and the benefits of vaccination to address concerns.
At the present time, do not introduce requirements of proof of vaccination or immunity for international travel as a condition of entry as there are still critical unknowns regarding the efficacy of vaccination in reducing transmission and limited availability of vaccines.
Proof of vaccination should not exempt international travellers from complying with other travel risk reduction measures.
Careful consideration should be given to when and if travel bans should or should not be used as tools to reduce spread.
Such decisions should be based on the best available evidence.
hare information with WHO on the effects of health measures in minimizing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during international travel to inform WHO’s development of evidence-based guidance.
Refine evidence-based strategies according to WHO guidance to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 using appropriate public health and social measures, including strategies that address pandemic fatigue.
Increase investment in surveillance and sequencing capacities to detect and report early emergence of variants and assess abrupt changes in transmission or disease severity to increase understanding of the evolution of the pandemic.
Utilize the WHO SARS-CoV-2 global laboratory network, leverage GISRS and other laboratory networks for timely reporting and sharing of samples; support other State Parties, where needed, in timely sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 virus specimens.
Continue to strengthen public health infrastructure, system capacities, and functions for COVID-19 response and to enhance universal health coverage.
Emergency Committee on COVID-19 advises on variants, vaccines
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), according to the WHO Emergency Committee (EC) on COVID-19.
The EC met virtually yesterday (14 January) at the request of WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to review the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and to consider the potential use of vaccination and testing certificates for international travel.
On variants, the EC called for a global expansion of genomic sequencing and sharing of data, along with greater scientific collaboration to address critical unknowns.
The committee urged WHO to develop a standardized system for naming new variants that avoids geographical markers, an area WHO has already begun work on.
On vaccines, the committee underlined the need for equitable access through the COVAX Facility as well as technology transfer to increase global production capacities.
The committee strongly encouraged vaccine manufacturers to rapidly provide safety and efficacy data to WHO for emergency use listing.
The lack of such data is a barrier to ensuring the timely and equitable supply of vaccines at the global level.
Given that the impact of vaccines in reducing transmission is yet unknown, and the current availability of vaccines is too limited, the committee recommended that countries do not require proof of vaccination from incoming travellers.
The committee advised countries to implement coordinated, evidence-based measures for safe travel and to share with WHO experiences and best practices learned.
This was the sixth meeting of the Emergency Committee on COVID-19.
Since the declaration of a PHEIC on 30 January 2020, the Director-General has been reconvening the committee at three-month intervals to review progress.
COVID-19: One year later – WHO Director-General’s new year message
Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General
As people around the world celebrated New Year's Eve 12 months ago, a new global threat emerged.
Since that moment, the COVID-19 pandemic has taken so many lives and caused massive disruption to families, societies and economies all over the world.
But it also triggered the fastest and most wide-reaching response to a global health emergency in human history.
The hallmarks of this response have been an unparalleled mobilization of science, a search for solutions and a commitment to global solidarity.
Acts of generosity, large and small, equipped hospitals with the tools that health workers needed to stay safe and care for their patients.
Outpourings of kindness have helped society’s most vulnerable through troubled times.
Vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics have been developed and rolled out, at record speed, thanks to collaborations including the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator.
Equity is the essence of the ACT Accelerator, and its vaccine arm, COVAX, which has secured access to 2 billion doses of promising vaccine candidates.
Vaccines offer great hope to turn the tide of the pandemic.
But to protect the world, we must ensure that all people at risk everywhere – not just in countries who can afford vaccines – are immunized.
To do this, COVAX needs just over 4 billion US dollars urgently to buy vaccines for low- and lower-middle income countries.
This is the challenge we must rise to in the new year.
My brothers and sisters, the events of 2020 have provided telling lessons, and reminders, for us all to take into 2021.
First and foremost, 2020 has shown that governments must increase investment in public health, from funding access to COVID vaccines for all people, to making our systems better prepared to prevent and respond to the next, inevitable, pandemic.
At the heart of this is investing in universal health coverage to make health for all a reality.
Second, as it will take time to vaccinate everyone against COVID, we must keep adhering to tried and tested measures that keep each and all of us safe.
This means maintaining physical distance, wearing face masks, practicing hand and respiratory hygiene, avoiding crowded indoor places and meeting people outside.
These simple, yet effective measures will save lives and reduce the suffering that so many people encountered in 2020.
Third, and above all, we must commit to working together in solidarity, as a global community, to promote and protect health today, and in the future.
We have seen how divisions in politics and communities feed the virus and foment the crisis.
But collaboration and partnership save lives and safeguard societies.
In 2020, a health crisis of historic proportions showed us just how closely connected we all are.
We saw how acts of kindness and care helped neighbors through times of great struggle.
But we also witnessed how acts of malice, and misinformation, caused avoidable harm.
Going into 2021, we have a simple, yet profound, choice to make:
Do we ignore the lessons of 2020 and allow insular, partisan approaches, conspiracy theories and attacks on science to prevail, resulting in unnecessary suffering to people’s health and society at large?
Or do we walk the last miles of this crisis together, helping each other along the way, from sharing vaccines fairly, to offering accurate advice, compassion and care to all who need, as one global family.
The choice is easy.
There is light at the end of the tunnel, and we will get there by taking the path together.
WHO stands with you – We Are Family and we are In This Together.
I wish you and your loved ones a peaceful, safe and healthy new year.
World’s largest youth organizations, representing 250 million members, and WHO launch global mobilization to respond to disruptive impacts of COVID-19 on young people
Funding for community programmes, engaging youth in solutions to address COVID-19, and convening Global Youth Summit are key features of this new mobilization
A new ground-breaking global youth mobilization was launched today to invest in and scale up youth-led solutions and engagements in response to COVID-19.
The initiative was launched by an alliance of the world’s largest youth movements and organizations, together with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Foundation.
The “Global Youth Mobilization for Generation Disrupted” is being led by the Big 6 Youth Organizations (Young Men’s Christian Association, YMCA; World Young Women’s Christian Association, YWCA; World Organization of the Scout Movement; World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts; International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, IFRC; and The Duke of Edinburgh’s International Award), which together actively involve more than 250 million young people, and aims to support young people to engage in and design efforts to turn around the impact of the pandemic.
The Global Youth Mobilization will feature the convening of a Global Youth Summit in April 2021, and a fund of US $5 million to support local and national youth organizations, including grants for youth-led solutions and an accelerator programme to scale up existing response efforts.
The leadership of the WHO, Big 6 and youth organizations around the world are calling on governments, businesses and policy makers to back the Global Youth Mobilization effort and commit to investing in the future of young people.
These measures will directly support young people engaged at the grassroots level to tackle some of the most pressing health and societal challenges resulting from the pandemic.
“WHO is honoured to join this truly exciting and powerful global movement to mobilize and empower youth worldwide to be the driving force of the recovery to COVID-19,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
“Joining forces with the Big 6 and the United Nations Foundation provides WHO and the world a unique opportunity to learn from hundreds of millions of young people and be guided by their sustainable solutions to help communities build back better from the pandemic.
While the direct health impacts of the pandemic on young people have been generally less severe, they are disproportionately affected by the long-lasting consequences of the pandemic.
Such effects include disruptions to education, economic uncertainty, loss or lack of employment opportunities, impacts on physical and mental health, and trauma from domestic violence.
For example, mental anxiety brought on by COVID-19 has been identified in nearly 90 per cent of young people; more than 1 billion students in almost every country have been impacted by school closures; and 1 in 6 young people worldwide have lost their jobs during the pandemic.
At the same time, young people are also driving change and implementing solutions in response to COVID-19 by taking action through community-based interventions and voluntary service, such as acting as first responders and delivering food and supplies to those in need.
The Global Youth Mobilization will draw attention to the urgent need for solutions to support young people, and to highlight the critical leadership role young people are playing in their communities to counter the effects of the pandemic.
We are proud to team up with the WHO to provide opportunities and funding to help millions of young people across the globe to respond to local challenges related to COVID-19 in their communities,” said the leadership of the Big 6 in a joint statement.
“The mobilization will provide direct financial and programmatic support to youth organizations at the national and international level.
We believe that young people have the solutions to solve their own problems, and by providing a global youth platform, combined with national activation for youth projects, we can unleash the skills, enthusiasm and desire for young people to be a force for good in their communities.
Supported by the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for WHO and powered by the United Nations Foundation, the Global Youth Mobilization features a strategic partnership with the WHO and its newly launched Youth Council.
It will involve other United Nations agencies, as well as a number of high-profile global partners, brands, and advocates, from FIFA to YOUNGA by BridgingTheGap Ventures, and the creation of a youth council of social media influencers, including the Influential platform.
The initiative, developed in consultation with young people from across the globe, will be youth-led, community-driven, evidence-based, and inclusive of diverse communities rooted in meaningful youth participation and engagement.
About the Big 6 Youth Organizations

Joint Statement on Data Protection and Privacy in the COVID-19 Response
The United Nations, IOM, ITU, OCHA, OHCHR, UNDP, UNEP, UNESCO, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNOPS, UPU, UN Volunteers, UN Women, WFP and WHO support the adoption of the following joint statement, in line with the UN Personal Data Protection and Privacy Principles adopted by the UN System Organizations to support its use of data and technology in the COVID-19 response in a way that respects the right to privacy and other human rights and promotes economic and social development.
The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global emergency, with devastating consequences in terms of loss of life and economic decline, and significantly hampering progress toward achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
Poor and vulnerable communities are particularly imperiled by this deadly disease and its economic ramifications.
Mounting evidence demonstrates that the collection, use, sharing and further processing of data can help limit the spread of the virus and aid in accelerating the recovery, especially through digital contact tracing.
Mobility data derived from people’s usage of mobile phones, emails, banking, social media, postal services, for instance, can assist in monitoring the spread of the virus and support the implementation of the UN System Organizations’ mandated activities.
Such data collection and processing, including for digital contact tracing and general health surveillance, may include the collection of vast amounts of personal and non-personal sensitive data.
This could have significant effects beyond the initial crisis response phase, including, if such measures are applied for purposes not directly or specifically related to the COVID-19 response, potentially leading to the infringement of fundamental human rights and freedoms.
This concern is especially pressing if some emergency measures introduced to address the pandemic, such as digital contact tracing, are turned into standard practice.
The UN Secretary-General highlighted in his policy brief on human rights and COVID-19 that “Human rights are key in shaping the pandemic response, both for the public health emergency and the broader impact on people’s lives and livelihoods.
Human rights put people centre-stage.
Responses that are shaped by and respect human rights result in better outcomes in beating the pandemic, ensuring healthcare for everyone and preserving human dignity.
Any data collection, use and processing by UN System Organizations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic should be rooted in human rights and implemented with due regard to applicable international law, data protection and privacy principles, including the UN Personal Data Protection and Privacy Principles.
Any measures taken to address the COVID-19 pandemic should also be consistent with the mandates of the respective UN System Organizations and take into account the balancing of relevant rights, including the right to health and life and the right to economic and social development.
Taking into account the UN Personal Data Protection and Privacy Principles, the UN Secretary-General’s policy brief on human rights and COVID-19, and relevant health and humanitarian standards, data collection, use and processing by UN System Organizations in their operations should, at a minimum:
Be lawful, limited in scope and time, and necessary and proportionate to specified and legitimate purposes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic;
Ensure appropriate confidentiality, security, time-bound retention and proper destruction or deletion of data in accordance with the aforementioned purposes;
Ensure that any data exchange adheres to applicable international law, data protection and privacy principles, and is evaluated based on proper due diligence and risks assessments;
Be subject to any applicable mechanisms and procedures to ensure that measures taken with regard to data use are justified by and in accordance with the aforementioned principles and purposes, and cease as soon as the need for such measures is no longer present; and
Be transparent in order to build trust in the deployment of current and future efforts alike.
A coordinated and inclusive global UN-wide response rooted in solidarity is necessary to contain the pandemic and minimize its negative impact across the world.
Although the statement is aimed to address the challenges of the current COVID-19 pandemic, it may serve as a precedent for using data to respond to any future crises of a similar scale quickly and while respecting data protection and privacy.
Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator commitments reach US$ 5.
1billion following new contributions, including at Paris Peace Forum
Donors commit to fund the scale up of the ACT-Accelerator but warn additional funding is critical to support its success
The European Commission, France, Spain, The Republic of Korea and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation pledge US$360 million to COVAX, the Vaccines Pillar of the ACT Accelerator
Emmanuel Macron, President of France; Erna Solberg, Prime Minister of Norway; Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission; Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO; Melinda Gates, Co-Chair of The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation discuss essential need for multilateral action and the ACT Accelerator’s role in ending the acute phase of the pandemic as quickly as possible
Leaders warn that the world’s capacity to fundamentally change the dynamic of the pandemic in the first half of 2021 is at risk if there are delays to urgent funding
Heads of state, global health leaders, scientists and the private sector have come together at the Paris Peace Forum this week to discuss how to meet the urgent funding needs of the ACT Accelerator.
New contributions bring the total committed to over US$ 5.
1 billion – but an additional US$ 4.
2 billion is needed urgently this year, with a further US$ 23.
9 billion required in 2021, if tools are to be deployed across the world as they become available.
Since April, the ACT Accelerator partnership, launched by WHO and partners, has supported the fastest, most coordinated, and successful global effort in history to develop tools to fight a disease.
With significant advances in research and development by academia, private sector and government initiatives, the ACT Accelerator is on the cusp of securing a way to end the acute phase of the pandemic by deploying the tests, treatments and vaccines the world needs.
Speaking at the Paris Peace Forum, Emmanuel Macron, President of France, said: “Together, we have implemented the ACT-A system, with the ambition to be part of a "global public good" approach, that is, to allow access for all to these tools to fight this pandemic.
Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission reminded delegates that the US$ 28 billion needed to fund the ACT-Accelerator to fulfil its objectives is equivalent to “the same sum the transport sector and the global tourism sector lose in just two days of lockdown”.
She added that “there is a very clear message behind it.
It’s way better to invest now in the ACT Accelerator and to COVAX – for the distribution in every corner of the world of vaccines – than to struggle longer with all the confinement measures we have suffered during this pandemic.
Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO, said: “This pandemic is unprecedented, and it has taken the whole world hostage.
The only option we have is cooperation and solidarity.
It is a must.
The world is seeing it that way.
Erna Solberg, Prime Minister of Norway and co-chair of the ACT Accelerator Facilitation Council, said: “We have to look beyond aid for financing.
We need to look at private sector, innovative mechanisms, other ways to get this money, fast.
We need to accelerate this faster than we are doing these days.
Melinda Gates, co-chair of The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, said: “COVID-19 has made distinction completely irrelevant.
In this pandemic, there’s no difference between helping yourself and helping others.
The self-interested thing and the selfless thing are one and the same.
In just 6 months the ACT Accelerator, through its partnership of the world’s leading international health organizations, has already delivered significant and concrete results: more than 50 diagnostic tests are being evaluated and new rapid antigen diagnostics are being made available for low and middle income countries; life-saving dexamethasone treatments are being used and rolled out; new monoclonal antibodies are being evaluated; 186 countries are working with COVAX, the world’s largest and most diverse portfolio of vaccines; a diverse research portfolio of nine vaccines candidates are in clinical trials and systems requirements for delivery of COVID-19 tools have been mapped in 4 of the world’s 6 regions.
The urgent funding need of US$ 4.
2 billion will save lives, lay the groundwork for mass procurement and delivery of COVID-19 tools around the world, and provide an exit strategy out of this global economic and human crisis by:
Massively expanding testing globally by immediately increasing the number & volumes of new high-quality rapid diagnostic tests and facilitating use in countries with fragile systems;
Transforming treatment to save lives by hugely accelerating the availability and use of dexamethasone and oxygen, and securing production capacities for monoclonal antibodies;
Rolling out mass vaccination by securing vaccines doses now to launch their worldwide rollout for at least 20% of the global population, while quickly investing in further R&D, technology transfer and scale-up of global manufacturing capacity; and
Unblocking bottlenecks to COVID-19 tools supply chain management, logistics and delivery with rapid assessments, integrated delivery plans and key investments in countries with the most fragile systems.
Fully financing the ACT-Accelerator will position the world to fundamentally change the dynamic of the pandemic.
Funding gaps mean delays in access to tools in 2021 and the world continuing to rely on non-pharmaceutical interventions like stay-at-home orders and physical distancing as the primary line of defense against the virus.
Against the ACT Accelerator’s US$ 38.
1 billion budget, outlined in its newly published ‘Urgent Priorities & Financing Requirements’, US$ 5.
1 billion has been committed to date, alongside down payments of US$ 4.
8 billion through COVAX self-financing countries.
The ACT Accelerator Commitment Tracker provides details on total commitments to date.
Fully financing the ACT Accelerator would shorten the pandemic, saving millions of lives with the investment paid back in as little as 36 hours as the global economy recovers.
Statement to the resumed 73rd World Health Assembly by the Chair of the Review Committee on the Functioning of the International Health Regulations (2005) during the COVID-19 Response
Statement delivered during the first session of Committee A of the resumed 73rd World Health Assembly, on 9 November 2020
Honorable Minister, Excellencies, Director-General, Chair of the Committee A, Ladies and Gentlemen
Thank you for the opportunity to provide you with an update on the work of the Review Committee on the functioning of the International Health Regulations (2005) during COVID-19.
This Committee was convened by the Director-General on 8 September 2020, following up on the request of Member States in the World Health Assembly Resolution WHA73.
1, and in line with Article 50 of the International Health Regulations (2005).
The Committee is composed of 21 members selected and nominated by the Director-General from the IHR Roster of Experts, comprising a wide range of expertise and with adequate gender and geographical representation.
I have the privilege and honour to be elected Chair of this Committee, and grateful to be supported by the elected Vice-Chair Professor Lucille Blumberg from South Africa and the elected Rapporteur Professor Preben Aavitsland from Norway.
The mandate we were given is to review the functioning of the International Health Regulations (2005) during the COVID-19 response, to review the status of implementation of the relevant recommendations of previous IHR Review Committees, and ultimately to make technical recommendations to the Director-General regarding the functioning of the Regulations and possible needs for amendments.
We convened for 9 closed meetings so far, and we also convened 3 open meetings, when we provided updates on our work and listened to the submissions and questions raised by Member States, international agencies and non-governmental organizations in official relation to WHO.
These open meetings were attended by more than 100 designated representatives.
I also reported on our initial work and progress to the Executive Board on 6 October.
We currently work mainly through three sub-groups: preparedness, alert, and response.
The sub-groups meet weekly for deliberations and interviews, and they report back to the weekly plenary meeting.
Let me take the opportunity to thank the Committee members who act assub-group leads, Dr Okwo-Bele, Dr Salter and Professor LeDuc.
Key questions we are addressing include:
On preparedness:
Do the current tools for IHR core capacities assessment and monitoring – such as SPAR, the State Party Self-Assessment Annual Reporting Tool, and Joint External Evaluations – cover all the necessary capacities, including those required at subnational levels?
How can the current tools for preparedness assessment and monitoring better help countries to implement a more effective response?
How can universal peer reviews be used to help improve IHR implementation?
On alert:
How was information shared during the early days of the outbreak under the IHR?
Does WHO need a stronger and clearer mandate to react if information is not provided by States Parties; if yes, how should this be implemented?
Is the determination of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and the consequences of declaring it clearly understood?
What would be the advantages/disadvantages of an intermediate level of alert?
On response:
How did WHO and States Parties implement their obligations with regard to additional health measures in relation to international traffic?
How are the current mechanisms of collaboration and coordination for global outbreak response functioning and how can they be improved, especially with regard to timely and transparent data sharing?
Preliminary findings include:
Preparedness assessment and monitoring as well as core capacities need to be further examined in light of the observed performance in the response of many Member States.
A universal peer-review mechanism such as that used in human rights reviews may be useful.
Both official information as well as information through media, social media and rumors are useful surveillance information.
IHR provisions for notification and verification of information for events need to be further examined to understand the reluctance of some countries for early reporting and the need for incentives or other approaches to ensure better compliance.
WHO-provided Rapid Risk Assessments for events that may pose a risk of international spread are of utmost importance.
The meaning and consequences of Public Health Emergencies of International Concern have to be fully understood by Member States and inter- as well as supranational institutions.
The relevance of an intermediate level of alert to prevent a PHEIC from occurring, and options for its implementation, need to be also clearly examined.
Implementation of travel restrictions at the national level was widespread.
The role of WHO in relation to travel recommendations as well as incentives for States Parties to comply with their obligations related to travel measures need to be further examined.
Strong support for the current mechanisms for global outbreak alert and response as well as adequate national legislation are key to strengthen the response to global public health risks.
The authority of National IHR Focal Points is critical to ensure rapid communication and coordination.
What also became very clear during our work so far, and looking beyond just the IHR, both strong public health as well as health care systems are needed for effective response.
Beside the work in the sub-groups we have started to organize our work around issues that are not addressed in the sub-groups or are relevant for more than one sub-group.
The overarching question of whether the IHR are fit for purpose.
Are there challenges in their design or in their implementation that raised concerns during the COVID-19 response?
Issues of financing at the national and international level, especially for preparedness, as well as the functions and effectiveness of IHR governance bodies and mechanisms.
Conducting an article-by-article analysis to ensure a systematic review and identify whether any amendments may be required.
And examining the progress made on implementing the recommendations of previous Review Committees to refine our own recommendations.
In our work, we have considered closely the submissions of Member States and other representatives, and will continue to do so.
So far, we have interviewed the Chairs of former Review Committees and Chairs of former or current Emergency Committees, WHO staff from Headquarters, some regional and country offices, some National IHR Focal Points, and a number of experts in the field.
Many more interviews are planned.
We have also requested our Secretariat to commission a number of analysis and literature reviews.
We are also discussing on a regular basis with the Chair of the Independent Oversight Advisory Committee and the Co-Chairs of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness to exchange findings and align our respective scopes of work and mandates.
Our next open meeting is planned for 8 December and we plan to have an interim report ready for the Executive Board session in January.
The deadline for our final report is the 74th WHA in May 2021.
However, as we all know this is an unusual process, since the review process is happening while the event under review is still unfolding, and we may not have a definite set of recommendations until the pandemic ends.
Let me remind us, that we are a technical expert group.
We make recommendations to the Director-General, and if we see that amendments may be required for the IHR to function more effectively, we will make such recommendations to the Director-General.
But whether these amendments are made or not to the IHR is a prerogative that sits entirely with Member States.
Lastly, let me emphasize one thing: we very much welcome the interactions with Member States during our open meetings and encourage all of you to share with us your ideas, suggestions and proposals at any time.
The IHR are your instrument, our instrument, of international public health law.
It is incumbent on us to make it work for all of us to better prepare and protect humanity against public health risks, through an effective, coordinated, multisectoral and evidence-based public health response, while being mindful of the potential consequences that such response may have on other sectors.
Thank you again for the opportunity to speak to you today and let me also thank the Director-General for the excellent support provided by the WHO Secretariat to this Review Committee.
And one last word of inspiration for us all, on a grey and misty day like today: “Believe that further a shore/ Is reachable from here”.
WHO-ICMRA joint statement on the need for improved global regulatory alignment on COVID-19 medicines and vaccines
The International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities (ICMRA) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have committed to working together to ensure that patients have access to safe and effective health products against COVID-19 as early as possible, while the existing rigorous scientific standards for the evaluation and safety monitoring of treatments and vaccines are maintained at all times.
In their joint statement, international medicines regulators and WHO reiterate that therapeutics and vaccines against COVID-19 can only be rapidly approved if applications are supported by robust and sound scientific evidence that allows medicine regulators to conclude on a positive benefit-risk balance for these products.
ICMRA and WHO also pledge to take concrete actions to ensure equitable access to safe, effective and quality-assured medicines for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 around the world.
In view of the large number of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments under development, and their potentially imminent roll-out, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities (ICMRA) have joined forces to uphold and promote the most rigorous, evidence-based regulatory practices by supporting the alignment of regulatory processes across all countries.
As in other areas of the pandemic response, multilateral cooperation between regulatory authorities will be critical in ensuring there is a level playing field, that COVID-19 vaccines and medicines are safe, effective and quality-assured, and that all countries may benefit from such products equitably and at the same time.
This joint statement commits each organization to a series of actions to make this happen.
ICMRA and WHO continue to join forces in collaborating to address the unprecedented global health challenges related to COVID-19 pandemic, affecting so many people in the world.
These challenges are best addressed by working together to ensure existing rigorous scientific standards of review and oversight are maintained, while still giving patients access to safe and effective medical products at the earliest time possible
Regulatory authorities for medical products, including medicines and vaccines, have the responsibility to approve quality assured, safe and effective products based on robust and reliable data.
The regulatory approval should be based on an independent scientific assessment of the balance of benefits and risks.
Robust and reliable data on efficacy and safety to support market approval of medicines and vaccines are best collected through randomized controlled clinical trials which control for bias, meet Good Clinical Practice standards, respect the rights, autonomy and safety of clinical trial participants, and can be audited.
To ensure patients have fast access to safe and effective medicines and vaccines, WHO and ICMRA, together with other stakeholders including public health institutions, are committed to the following actions:
Working to prioritise well-designed clinical trials that will provide robust and reliable results.
Ensuring that there are meaningful and scientifically sound endpoints and safety data of sufficient duration in clinical trials;
Sharing data between regulators in real time to facilitate multi-country approvals;
Putting in place processes and policies utilizing the principles of regulatory agility by ICMRA members and WHO member states, providing an agile and rapid response to the global emergency;
Committing to full transparency of clinical trial results to support regulatory decisions, as well as ensuring public trust in authorities and confidence in vaccines
Working together to prevent and/or mitigate shortages of critical medicines and vaccines;
Continue working together once these COVID-19 therapies and vaccines are authorized and used to monitor their use, and identify, communicate and mitigate any safety or efficacy issues which may arise;
Reduce the risks associated with unproven treatments, potentially fraudulent and false claims, which endanger patients’ lives.
World Health Assembly charts course for COVID-19 response and global health priorities
As health leaders prepare to gather for a virtual session of the resumed 73rd World Health Assembly (WHA), WHO has three messages to share.
First, we can beat COVID-19 with science, solutions and solidarity.
More than 47 million COVID-19 cases have now been reported to WHO, and more than 1.
2 million people have lost their lives.
Although this is a global crisis, many countries and cities have successfully prevented or controlled transmission with a comprehensive, evidence-based approach.
For the first time, the world has rallied behind a plan to accelerate the development of the vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics we need, and to ensure they are available to all countries on the basis of equity.
The Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator is delivering real results.
Second, we must not backslide on our critical health goals.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a sobering reminder that health is the foundation of social, economic and political stability.
It reminds us why WHO’s ‘triple billion’ targets are so important, and why countries must pursue them with even more determination, collaboration and innovation.
Since May, Member States have adopted a number of decisions – the Immunization Agenda 2030, the Decade of Healthy Ageing 2020-2030, as well as initiatives to tackle cervical cancer, tuberculosis, eye care, food safety, intellectual property and influenza preparedness.
The resumed session will discuss a 10-year-plan for addressing neglected tropical diseases, as well as efforts to address meningitis, epilepsy and other neurological disorders, maternal infant and young child nutrition, digital health, and the WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel, adopted in 2010.
Third, we must prepare for the next pandemic now.
We’ve seen this past year that countries with robust health emergency preparedness infrastructure have been able to act quickly to contain and control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
The WHA will consider a draft resolution (EB146.
R10) that strengthens Member States’ preparedness for health emergencies, such as COVID-19, through more robust compliance with the International Health Regulations (2005).
This resolution calls on the global health community to ensure that all countries are better equipped to detect and respond to cases of COVID-19 and other dangerous infectious diseases.
NOTE TO EDITORS
The World Health Assembly (WHA) is the decision-making body of WHO, attended by delegations from all WHO Member States.
The main functions of the World Health Assembly are to determine the policies of the Organization, appoint the Director-General, supervise financial policies, and review and approve the proposed programme budget.
The WHA usually takes place in May.
This year, given the COVID-19 pandemic, a reduced (de minimis) WHA took place on 18-19 May.
The resumed WHA73 will take place virtually from 9-14 November 2020.
Statement on the fifth meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee regarding the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic
The fifth meeting of the Emergency Committee convened by the WHO Director-General under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) regarding the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) took place on Thursday, 29 October 2020 from 12:30 to 16:05 Geneva time (CEST).
Members and advisors of the Emergency Committee were convened by videoconference.
The Director-General welcomed the Committee, highlighted global advances and challenges in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, and expressed his appreciation to the Committee for their continued support and advice.
They were additionally reminded of their duty to maintain the confidentiality of the meeting discussions and the work of the committee.
The WHO Assistant Directors-General for Emergency Response and for Emergency Preparedness and International Health Regulations provided an overview of the current context and an update on the implementation of the 1 August 2020 Temporary Recommendation.
WHO continues to assess the global risk level of the COVID-19 pandemic as very high.
The Committee expressed strong appreciation for WHO’s leadership and activities throughout the global response.
In particular, the Committee appreciated WHO’s critical role in developing evidence-based guidance and recommendations; providing countries with technical assistance and operational support; communicating clear information and addressing misinformation; and convening the Solidarity Trials and the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator.
The Committee commended WHO’s sustained efforts to strengthen national, regional, and global responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.
After ensuing discussion, the Committee unanimously agreed that the pandemic still constitutes an extraordinary event, a public health risk to other States through international spread, and continues to require a coordinated international response.
As such, the Committee considered the COVID-19 pandemic to remain a public health emergency of international concern and offered advice to the Director-General.
He accepted the advice of the Committee to WHO and issued the Committee’s advice to States Parties as Temporary Recommendations under the IHR (2005).
Leadership and Coordination
Continue to coordinate global and regional multilateral organizations, partners, and networks and share best practices for responding to the pandemic.
Provide States Parties with a mechanism including templates and processes to report on national progress in implementing the temporary recommendations; collect, analyze, and provide regular updates to the Committee on this progress.
Continue to provide evidence-based guidance for COVID-19 readiness and response.
This guidance should include sustainable long-term response strategies, mitigation approaches for different levels of transmission, refined indicators for risk management and pandemic response, a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of public health and social measures for COVID-19 response, and lessons learned including from intra-action reviews.
Research
Continue to convene multi-disciplinary experts to agree on consistent language for and to further explain: all potential modes of transmission and virulence of SARS-CoV-2; severity risk factors and epidemiology of COVID-19; and the striking diversity of the pandemic dynamics globally.
Continue intersectoral collaborations to understand the origin of SARS-CoV-2, the role/impact of animals, and provide regular updates on international research findings.
Continue to work with partners to refine mathematical models that can inform policy decisions on how best to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.
Surveillance and Contact Tracing
Continue to work with partners and networks to provide guidance, tools, and trainings to support countries in strengthening their robust public health surveillance, comprehensive contact tracing, and cluster investigation.
Encourage and support countries to understand and report on their epidemiological situation and relevant indicators including through leveraging existing influenza sentinel surveillance systems for COVID-19.
Risk communications and community engagement
Continue to work with partners to counter the ongoing infodemic and provide guidance on community mobilization to support effective public health and social measures.
Diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines
Continue to support development of and equitable access to diagnostics, safe and effective therapeutics and vaccines, through the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator; continue to work with all ACT Accelerator partners to provide countries with additional clarity on the processes to enable equitable and timely access to diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines, including in humanitarian settings.
Accelerate support to enhance countries’ readiness for COVID-19 vaccine introduction by providing guidance, tools, and technical assistance for critical areas such as vaccination strategies, vaccine acceptance and demand, training, supply and logistics with a focus on cold chain, and monitoring uptake and vaccine safety.
Continue to work with partners to update and review evidence-based guidance for international travel consistent with IHR (2005) provisions.
This guidance should focus on effective, risk-based, and coherent approaches (including targeted use of diagnostics and quarantine) that consider transmission levels, response capacities in origin and destination countries, and relevant travel-specific considerations.
Essential Health Services
Work with partners to support countries in strengthening their essential health services, with a particular focus on mental health, public health prevention and control systems, and other societal impacts, as well as preparing for and responding to concurrent outbreaks, such as seasonal influenza.
Temporary Recommendations to State Parties
Leadership and coordination
Continue to share with WHO best practices, including from intra-action reviews, and apply lessons learned for mitigating resurgence of COVID-19; invest in implementing National Action Plans for sustainable preparedness and response capacities in compliance with the IHR requirements.
Report to WHO on progress in implementing the Temporary Recommendations, particularly major achievements, milestones, and obstacles.
This information will empower countries, WHO, partners, and the Committee to continue to make informed decisions as the pandemic evolves.
Avoid politicization or complacency with regards to the pandemic response which negatively impact local, national, regional, and global response efforts.
National strategies and localized readiness and response activities should be driven by science, data, and experience and should engage and enable all sectors using a whole-of-society approach.
Implement a dynamic risk management approach using appropriate indicators to inform time-limited, evidence-based public health and social measures.
Conduct research and share information on transmission, including role of aerosols; presence and potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 in animal populations; and potential sources of contamination (such as frozen products) to mitigate potential risks through preventative measures and international cooperation.
Sustain efforts to strengthen public health surveillance systems and investments in a trained workforce for active case finding, comprehensive contact tracing, and cluster investigations.
Continue timely and consistent reporting to WHO, including through platforms such as GISRS, on all recommended indicators for COVID-19 epidemiology and severity, response measures, and concurrent outbreaks, to enhance global understanding of the pandemic’s evolution.
Risk Communications and Community Engagement
Engage and empower individuals and communities to strengthen confidence in the COVID-19 response and promote sustained adherence to public health and social measures underpinned by the principles of solidarity and human rights; monitor and address rumours and misinformation.
Diagnostics, Therapeutics, and Vaccines
Establish a national multi-disciplinary taskforce, assess progress using the COVID-19 Vaccine Introduction Readiness Assessment Tool (VIRAT), and prepare the National Deployment and Vaccination Plan, which can serve as the holistic operational plan for COVID-19 vaccine introduction.
A strong emphasis should be placed on communication with communities to prepare for COVID-19 vaccination.
Regularly re-consider measures applied to international travel in compliance with Article 43 of the IHR (2005) and continue to provide information and rationales to WHO on measures that significantly interfere with international traffic.
Ensure that measures affecting international traffic (including targeted use of diagnostics and quarantine) are risk-based, evidence-based, coherent, proportionate and time limited.
Continue to strengthen capacity at points of entry to manage potential risks of cross-border transmission and to facilitate international contact tracing.
Maintain essential health services with sufficient funding, supplies, and human resources; strengthen health systems to cope with mental health impacts of the pandemic, concurrent disease outbreaks, and other emergencies.
The World Health Organization and Wikimedia Foundation expand access to trusted information about COVID-19 on Wikipedia
The collaboration is part of a shared commitment from both organizations to ensure everyone has access to critical public health information surrounding the global coronavirus pandemic
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that administers Wikipedia, announced today a collaboration to expand the public’s access to the latest and most reliable information about COVID-19.
The collaboration will make trusted, public health information available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license at a time when countries face continuing resurgences of COVID-19 and social stability increasingly depends on the public’s shared understanding of the facts.
Through the collaboration, people everywhere will be able to access and share WHO infographics, videos, and other public health assets on Wikimedia Commons, a digital library of free images and other multimedia.
With these new freely-licensed resources, Wikipedia’s more than 250,000 volunteer editors can also build on and expand the site’s COVID-19 coverage, which currently offers more than 5,200 coronavirus-related articles in 175 languages.
This WHO content will also be translated across national and regional languages through Wikipedia’s vast network of global volunteers.
“Equitable access to trusted health information is critical to keeping people safe and informed during the COVID-19 pandemic," said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization.
"Our new collaboration with the Wikimedia Foundation will increase access to reliable health information from WHO across multiple countries, languages, and devices.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, WHO has taken steps to prevent an “infodemic”— defined by the organization as “an overabundance of information and the rapid spread of misleading or fabricated news, images, and videos.
Wikipedia editors have similarly been on the frontlines of preventing the spread of misinformation surrounding the coronavirus, ensuring information about the pandemic is based on reliable sources and updated regularly on Wikipedia.
By making verified information about the pandemic available to more people on one of the world’s most-visited knowledge resources, the organizations aim to help curb this infodemic and ensure everyone can access critical public health information.
“Access to information is essential to healthy communities and should be treated as such,” said Katherine Maher, CEO at the Wikimedia Foundation.
“This becomes even more clear in times of global health crises when information can have life-changing consequences.
All institutions, from governments to international health agencies, scientific bodies to Wikipedia, must do our part to ensure everyone has equitable and trusted access to knowledge about public health, regardless of where you live or the language you speak.
WHO has served as the leading international health agency spearheading the global response to the coronavirus outbreak.
Since the beginning, WHO has worked to rapidly establish international coordination, scale up country readiness and response, and accelerate research and innovation.
Today, as information on the transmission and epidemiology of the virus evolves, WHO continues to provide essential guidance and public health recommendations to governments, communities and individuals everywhere.
At the same time, Wikipedia volunteer editors, many of whom are from the medical community, have been creating, updating, and translating Wikipedia articles with information from reliable sources about the pandemic.
As one of the top ten sites in the world, studies have shown that Wikipedia is one of the most frequently viewed sources for health information.
At the moment, readers can access WHO’s mythbusting series of infographics on Wikimedia Commons.
The infographics, which focus on addressing common misconceptions about COVID-19, are also available for Wikipedia editors to incorporate into Wikipedia articles.
In the coming months, the Wikimedia Foundation and WHO will continue uploading resources to Wikimedia Commons and collaborating with Wikipedia volunteer editors to better understand gaps in information needs on Wikipedia articles related to COVID-19 and how WHO resources can help fill these gaps.
Additionally, under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license, other organizations, individuals, and websites can more easily share these materials on their own platforms without having to address stricter copyright restrictions.

Kim Sledge and the World We Want partner with WHO Foundation to re-record unity anthem “We Are Family” in response to COVID-19 and to focus on global public health needs
Special edition cover of the classic song “We Are Family’ will be accompanied by a worldwide viral video starring celebrities, frontline health heroes, leaders and members of the public singing together in a show of solidarity and support for addressing present and future global public health needs, including COVID-19.
Launching today, the #WeAreFamily video campaign will invite people worldwide to star in the music video, recording videos of themselves with their close family and friends singing the song and then sharing this on their social media channels.
Part of the proceeds from the new song, being released 9 Nov, will be donated to the WHO Foundation to support the response to COVID-19 and promotion and protection of health for people around the world.
A special edition cover of Sister Sledge’s timeless hit We Are Family will be released in a new and inspiring call for global solidarity to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and to generate proceeds to address the most pressing global health challenges of our time.
The initiative is being launched by The World We Want, the global social impact enterprise, and Kim Sledge, part of the legendary multi-Gold and Platinum recording music group, in benefit of the WHO Foundation, and supported by the World Health Organization (WHO).
This new initiative, being launched ahead of United Nations Day on 24 October, will also be accompanied by a unique video and social media campaign, and sound a bold and hopeful call for solidarity, unity, and collaboration to promote and protect the health and wellbeing for every person on the planet.
A call for solidarity
The inspiration to release a special edition of the classic track came in March 2020 as communities around the world were left reeling from the impact of COVID-19.
Kim Sledge said: “From the doctors and nurses on the front lines, to the paramedics and police, from the midwives and scientists to the carers for the vulnerable, the We Are Family initiative will salute each and every one with a feeling of unity, strength and solidarity in response to the unprecedented challenges the world faces as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.
“There are many people who motivated me to embark on this new initiative in support of making We Are Family come to life, and who are very dedicated to finding ways to conquer this crisis.
They include my close family friend Lou Weisbach, my Mercy Seat Ministry brothers and sisters, and all of the global health workers, scientists, the essential labourers, care givers and emergency personnel around the world who have been working day and night during the pandemic in support of others,” added Kim, a vocalist, philanthropist, novelist, songwriter, producer and Minister.
Using music’s universal power in bringing the world together, the #WeAreFamily campaign is focused on raising awareness on, and much needed resources for, addressing global public health needs, from emergency preparedness, outbreak response, and stronger health systems to promoting mental health and preventing non-communicable diseases.
Natasha Mudhar, founder of The World We Want and the driving force behind the #WeAreFamily campaign, said: “We Are Family is one of the most instantly recognizable anthems in the world.
The song carries such an inspiring message of unity and solidarity.
We are certain that the We Are Family song and video initiative is being launched at the right time.
It is a rallying cry for togetherness, for the strength of our global family.
We are all together during these times.
Special edition version song to support health efforts
The special edition of the classic We Are Family song will be released online for download on 9 November 2020 in conjunction with the opening of the World Health Assembly, at which Kim Sledge is also scheduled to perform the song alongside choral singers from New York to Tonga.
A portion of the song’s proceeds will be donated to the WHO Foundation to support the delivery of life-saving health services.
Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, said: “We Are Family is more than a song.
It is a call to action for collaboration and kindness, and a reminder of the strength of family and the importance of coming together to help others in times of need.
Dr Tedros added: “Now more than ever, communities and individuals all over the world need to heed this message and come together, as a global family, to support each other through this COVID-19 challenge, and to remember that our health and wellbeing is our most precious gift.
I am grateful to Kim Sledge and the World We Want for sharing this masterpiece and message of hope with us all.
It is only through national unity and global solidarity that we will overcome COVID-19 and ensure people all over the world attain the highest level of health and well-being.
Join the We Are Family video campaign
In support of the song’s release, a call is being launched today (19 October) for people worldwide to submit videos of themselves singing We Are Family for inclusion in a unique and inspiring compilation video for release on 7 December 2020.
This video will honour the incredible work of the frontline workforces risking their lives around to save ours, and all those around the world who have been affected by the pandemic.

Solidarity Therapeutics Trial produces conclusive evidence on the effectiveness of repurposed drugs for COVID-19 in record time
In just six months, the world’s largest randomized control trial on COVID-19 therapeutics has generated conclusive evidence on the effectiveness of repurposed drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.
Interim results from the Solidarity Therapeutics Trial, coordinated by the World Health Organization, indicate that remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon regimens appeared to have little or no effect on 28-day mortality or the in-hospital course of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients.
The study, which spans more than 30 countries, looked at the effects of these treatments on overall mortality, initiation of ventilation, and duration of hospital stay in hospitalized patients.
Other uses of the drugs, for example in treatment of patients in the community or for prevention, would have to be examined using different trials.
The progress achieved by the Solidarity Therapeutics Trial shows that large international trials are possible, even during a pandemic, and offer the promise of quickly and reliably answering critical public health questions concerning therapeutics.
The results of the trial are under review for publication in a medical journal and have been uploaded as preprint at medRxiv available at this link: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.15.20209817v1
The global platform of the Solidarity Trial is ready to rapidly evaluate promising new treatment options, with nearly 500 hospitals open as trial sites.
Newer antiviral drugs, immunomodulators and anti-SARS COV-2 monoclonal antibodies are now being considered for evaluation.
Impact of COVID-19 on people's livelihoods, their health and our food systems
Joint statement by ILO, FAO, IFAD and WHO
The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic loss of human life worldwide and presents an unprecedented challenge to public health, food systems and the world of work.
The economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic is devastating: tens of millions of people are at risk of falling into extreme poverty, while the number of undernourished people, currently estimated at nearly 690 million, could increase by up to 132 million by the end of the year.
Millions of enterprises face an existential threat.
Nearly half of the world’s 3.
3 billion global workforce are at risk of losing their livelihoods.
Informal economy workers are particularly vulnerable because the majority lack social protection and access to quality health care and have lost access to productive assets.
Without the means to earn an income during lockdowns, many are unable to feed themselves and their families.
For most, no income means no food, or, at best, less food and less nutritious food.
The pandemic has been affecting the entire food system and has laid bare its fragility.
Border closures, trade restrictions and confinement measures have been preventing farmers from accessing markets, including for buying inputs and selling their produce, and agricultural workers from harvesting crops, thus disrupting domestic and international food supply chains and reducing access to healthy, safe and diverse diets.
The pandemic has decimated jobs and placed millions of livelihoods at risk.
As breadwinners lose jobs, fall ill and die, the food security and nutrition of millions of women and men are under threat, with those in low-income countries, particularly the most marginalized populations, which include small-scale farmers and indigenous peoples, being hardest hit.
Millions of agricultural workers – waged and self-employed – while feeding the world, regularly face high levels of working poverty, malnutrition and poor health, and suffer from a lack of safety and labour protection as well as other types of abuse.
With low and irregular incomes and a lack of social support, many of them are spurred to continue working, often in unsafe conditions, thus exposing themselves and their families to additional risks.
Further, when experiencing income losses, they may resort to negative coping strategies, such as distress sale of assets, predatory loans or child labour.
Migrant agricultural workers are particularly vulnerable, because they face risks in their transport, working and living conditions and struggle to access support measures put in place by governments.
Guaranteeing the safety and health of all agri-food workers – from primary producers to those involved in food processing, transport and retail, including street food vendors – as well as better incomes and protection, will be critical to saving lives and protecting public health, people’s livelihoods and food security.
In the COVID-19 crisis food security, public health, and employment and labour issues, in particular workers’ health and safety, converge.
Adhering to workplace safety and health practices and ensuring access to decent work and the protection of labour rights in all industries will be crucial in addressing the human dimension of the crisis.
Immediate and purposeful action to save lives and livelihoods should include extending social protection towards universal health coverage and income support for those most affected.
These include workers in the informal economy and in poorly protected and low-paid jobs, including youth, older workers, and migrants.
Particular attention must be paid to the situation of women, who are over-represented in low-paid jobs and care roles.
Different forms of support are key, including cash transfers, child allowances and healthy school meals, shelter and food relief initiatives, support for employment retention and recovery, and financial relief for businesses, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.
In designing and implementing such measures it is essential that governments work closely with employers and workers.
Countries dealing with existing humanitarian crises or emergencies are particularly exposed to the effects of COVID-19.
Responding swiftly to the pandemic, while ensuring that humanitarian and recovery assistance reaches those most in need, is critical.
Now is the time for global solidarity and support, especially with the most vulnerable in our societies, particularly in the emerging and developing world.
Only together can we overcome the intertwined health and social and economic impacts of the pandemic and prevent its escalation into a protracted humanitarian and food security catastrophe, with the potential loss of already achieved development gains.
We must recognize this opportunity to build back better, as noted in the Policy Brief issued by the United Nations Secretary-General.
We are committed to pooling our expertise and experience to support countries in their crisis response measures and efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
We need to develop long-term sustainable strategies to address the challenges facing the health and agri-food sectors.
Priority should be given to addressing underlying food security and malnutrition challenges, tackling rural poverty, in particular through more and better jobs in the rural economy, extending social protection to all, facilitating safe migration pathways and promoting the formalization of the informal economy.
We must rethink the future of our environment and tackle climate change and environmental degradation with ambition and urgency.
Only then can we protect the health, livelihoods, food security and nutrition of all people, and ensure that our ‘new normal’ is a better one.
COVID-19 disrupting mental health services in most countries, WHO survey
World Mental Health Day on 10 October to highlight urgent need to increase investment in chronically underfunded sector
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted or halted critical mental health services in 93% of countries worldwide while the demand for mental health is increasing, according to a new WHO survey.
The survey of 130 countries provides the first global data showing the devastating impact of COVID-19 on access to mental health services and underscores the urgent need for increased funding.
The survey was published ahead of WHO’s Big Event for Mental Health ?
a global online advocacy event on 10 October that will bring together world leaders, celebrities, and advocates to call for increased mental health investments in the wake of COVID-19.
WHO has previously highlighted the chronic underfunding of mental health: prior to the pandemic, countries were spending less than 2 per cent of their national health budgets on mental health, and struggling to meet their populations’ needs.
And the pandemic is increasing demand for mental health services.
Bereavement, isolation, loss of income and fear are triggering mental health conditions or exacerbating existing ones.
Many people may be facing increased levels of alcohol and drug use, insomnia, and anxiety.
Meanwhile, COVID-19 itself can lead to neurological and mental complications, such as delirium, agitation, and stroke.
People with pre-existing mental, neurological or substance use disorders are also more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection ?
they may stand a higher risk of severe outcomes and even death.
“Good mental health is absolutely fundamental to overall health and well-being,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization.
“COVID-19 has interrupted essential mental health services around the world just when they’re needed most.
World leaders must move fast and decisively to invest more in life-saving mental health programmes ?
during the pandemic and beyond.
Survey finds major disruptions to critical mental health services
The survey was conducted from June to August 2020 among 130 countries across WHO’s six regions.
It evaluates how the provision of mental, neurological and substance use services has changed due to COVID-19, the types of services that have been disrupted, and how countries are adapting to overcome these challenges.
Countries reported widespread disruption of many kinds of critical mental health services:
Over 60% reported disruptions to mental health services for vulnerable people, including children and adolescents (72%), older adults (70%), and women requiring antenatal or postnatal services (61%).
67% saw disruptions to counseling and psychotherapy; 65% to critical harm reduction services; and 45% to opioid agonist maintenance treatment for opioid dependence.
More than a third (35%) reported disruptions to emergency interventions, including those for people experiencing prolonged seizures; severe substance use withdrawal syndromes; and delirium, often a sign of a serious underlying medical condition.
30% reported disruptions to access for medications for mental, neurological and substance use disorders.
Around three-quarters reported at least partial disruptions to school and workplace mental health services (78% and 75% respectively).
While many countries (70%) have adopted telemedicine or teletherapy to overcome disruptions to in-person services, there are significant disparities in the uptake of these interventions.
More than 80% of high-income countries reported deploying telemedicine and teletherapy to bridge gaps in mental health, compared with less than 50% of low-income countries.
WHO has issued guidance to countries on how to maintain essential services ?
including mental health services ?
during COVID-19 and recommends that countries allocate resources to mental health as an integral component of their response and recovery plans.
The Organization also urges countries to monitor changes and disruptions in services so that they can address them as required.
Although 89% of countries reported in the survey that mental health and psychosocial support is part of their national COVID-19 response plans, only 17% of these countries have full additional funding for covering these activities.
This all highlights the need for more money for mental health.
As the pandemic continues, even greater demand will be placed on national and international mental health programmes that have suffered from years of chronic underfunding.
Spending 2% of national health budgets on mental health is not enough.
International funders also need to do more: mental health still receives less than 1% of international aid earmarked for health.
Those who do invest in mental health will reap rewards.
Pre-COVID-19 estimates reveal that nearly US$ 1 trillion in economic productivity is lost annually from depression and anxiety alone.
However, studies show that every US$ 1 spent on evidence-based care for depression and anxiety returns US$5.
Note on World Mental Health Day: Mobilizing the global community to #MoveforMentalHeatlh
On World Mental Health Day (Saturday 10 October), as part of its campaign Move for mental health: let’s invest, WHO is inviting the global community to take part in The Big Event for Mental Health, an unprecedented online advocacy event that will call for increased investment in mental health at all levels ?
from individuals to businesses to countries to civil society ?
so that the world can begin to close the gaps highlighted by today’s report.
The Big Event is free and open to the public and will be broadcast on 10 October from 16:00 to 19:00 CEST on WHO’s YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok and LinkedIn channels and website.
For updated information about the Big Event for Mental Health, including the latest lineup of performances and participants, visit the Big Event web page.

UN welcomes nearly $1 billion in recent pledges - to bolster access to lifesaving tests, treatments and vaccines to end COVID-19
New commitments from governments, international organizations and the private sector support unified approach to end pandemic, backing a response of unprecedented scale, scope and speed­—through the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator­—as pandemic claims more than 1 million lives
Recent Commitments at a Glance:
United Kingdom – £571m (US$ 732m) for COVAX pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools- (ACT) Accelerator, of which up to £500m (US$ 641m) is to support low- and middle-income countries.
This includes a commitment to match £1 for every US$ 4 committed by others up to £250m (US$ 321m).
Canada - CAD 440m (US$ 332m) for the COVAX pillar of the ACT-Accelerator, of which CAD 220 (US$ 166m) is to support low & middle income countries
Germany - EUR 100m (US$ 117m) for the COVAX pillar of the ACT-Accelerator, all of which is to support low and middle income countries
Sweden - US$ 10m for the COVAX pillar of the ACT-Accelerator, all of which is to support low and middle income countries
World Bank – US$ 12 billion to support developing countries to purchase COVID-19 vaccines as soon as they are available (to be ratified by their shareholders)
A coalition of 16 pharmaceutical companies and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation signed an agreement to cooperate on vaccine manufacturing and to scale up production
The United Nations and its partners today welcomed a monumental show of solidarity as governments, private sector, civil society and international organizations committed support to the Access to COVID-19 Tools- (ACT) Accelerator initiative launched by the World Health Organization alongside international partners.
Today, nearly US$1 billion in new financing has been committed to the initiative - the world’s most comprehensive multilateral end-to-end solution to the devastating COVID-19 pandemic.
The ACT-Accelerator, which was co-launched by the World Health Organization, European Commission, France and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation just five months ago, needs an additional US$35 billion to realize its goals of producing 2 billion vaccine doses, 245 million treatments and 500 million tests.
The new commitments to the initiative are welcome and will be leveraged to catalyze further funding to continue the ACT-Accelerator’s groundbreaking work.
Most urgently, the ACT-Accelerator requires US$15 billion to support immediate capacity-building—for research and development, manufacturing, procurement and delivery systems—by the end of the year.
Convening a high-level event at the 75th Session of the UN General Assembly to urgently mobilize support for the ACT-Accelerator, Secretary-General António Guterres commended on the “extraordinary international effort to address a human crisis like no other in our lifetimes,” adding that more efforts must be made to further “deepen” the remarkable progress so far.
“It is in every country’s national and economic self-interest to work together to massively expand access to tests and treatments, and to support a vaccine as a global public good—a “people’s vaccine” available and affordable for everyone, everywhere.
”The ACT-Accelerator—including its COVAX Facility—is the vehicle to get us there.
Investing in the ACT-Accelerator will accelerate every country’s own recovery,” said Mr.
Guterres who co-hosted the event with the United Kingdom’s Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, South Africa’s Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, and the Director-General of World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
Unprecedented Global Collaboration
The ACT-Accelerator, which was launched just five months ago, is an unprecedented global collaboration of the world’s top international health organizations working together to accelerate the development, production, and equitable delivery of COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.
“We have a duty to ensure vaccines, treatments and tests for COVID-19 are available to all—stopping the global spread of the pandemic protects the British people and will put humanity on the road to recovery.
Collaboration through the ACT-Accelerator is critical to promoting development, production and access for all countries,” said UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.
The United Kingdom recently committed up to £571m (approximately US$ 732m) for COVAX.
This includes up to £500m for the Gavi Advanced Market Commitment for COVID-19 (COVAX AMC) vaccines—a financing instrument that incentivises vaccine manufacturers to produce sufficient COVID-19 vaccines to ensure access for developing countries.
Today, the UK Foreign Secretary called for more support, pledging that this £500m commitment would include £1 (IS$ 1.
29) in matched funding for every US$4 committed by others for up to £250m (approximately US$ 321m).
Germany, Canada and Sweden have also made new commitments to the COVAX AMC of Euro 100 million, CAD$ 220 million and US$ 10 million respectively.
These are eligible for matching with today’s UK matching commitment.
”Science is giving us solutions, in the form of new tests, therapeutics and­—hopefully—a vaccine.
But science and solutions will be ineffective without solidarity,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
“I am grateful for the generous financial commitments made today, but we still have a significant funding gap to close.
Fully financing the ACT Accelerator will help to control the pandemic, restore confidence and stimulate the global recovery.
Frankly, this is not a financial challenge, it’s a test of solidarity.
This is a moment for saying no to nationalism and yes to our shared humanity.
Because ultimately, the ACT Accelerator is not delivering merely vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics.
It’s delivering something far more important—hope.
“We must confront this health crisis as a global challenge, together in solidarity and cooperation with one another, working toward a global solution.
We have to generate the key tests, treatments and vaccines that we all need, and make sure they are distributed equitably to people who most need them, regardless of where they live and whether their country is wealthy or not,” said South Africa’s Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, adding that large parts of the population especially in developing countries remain “vulnerable and marginalized during this pandemic.
Today’s event highlighted the substantial results achieved by the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator initiative since its launch: the availability of 120 million affordable and high-quality rapid tests for low- and middle-income countries; a breakthrough in trials with, and a rapid rollout of, Dexamethasone—the only drug found to make a significant difference to patient mortality; the creation of the COVAX Facility – the global mechanism to ensure equitable access to eventual COVID-19 vaccines regardless of income -comprising 168 economies and the largest and most diverse vaccine portfolio in the world, with nine candidate vaccines under evaluation, eight of them in clinical trials.
In another significant show of support, a coalition of 16 pharmaceutical companies and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation signed an agreement to cooperate on vaccine manufacturing and to scale up production at an unprecedented speed, ensuring that approved vaccines are more broadly accessible and distributed as early as possible.
Bill Gates, Co-Chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation said “One thing I've learned studying the history of pandemics is that they create a surprising dynamic when it comes to self-interest and altruism.
Pandemics are rare cases where a country’s instinct to help itself is tightly aligned with its instinct to help others.
The self-interested thing and the altruistic thing–making sure poor nations have access to vaccines–are one and the same.
“A number of countries, most recently the United Kingdom and Canada, are good models for what other wealthy nations should do.
They have donated enough money for COVAX, the vaccine pillar of the ACT-Accelerator, to procure, probably, hundreds of millions of vaccine doses for poor countries.
But more will be needed and I hope wealthy nations will continue to be generous.
The World Bank unveiled plans this week for a significant financial commitment to support developing countries to purchase COVID-19 vaccines as soon as they are available.
World Bank President David Malpass said that once the plans are ratified by stakeholders, “having up to US$ 12 billion available in finance will be a game changer because once a safe and effective vaccine is available, it will allow people to resume their lives with confidence.
Investing in Global Recovery
The ACT-Accelerator Investment Case illustrates the considerable economic benefits of collectively accelerating the development and deployment of tools to rapidly reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 disease globally.
Prior to UNGA 2020, the ACT-Accelerator has raised US$3 billion out of a need of US$38 billion.
More detail can be found in the Act-Accelerator investment case.
The economic rationale for investing in an approach that can accelerate the end of the COVID-19 crisis remains clear.
Fully financing the initiative to help shorten the duration of the crisis would pay back this investment in less than 36 hours once global mobility and trade alone are restored.
The Access to COVID-19 Tools ACT-Accelerator, is the proven, up-and-running global collaboration to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.
The ACT-Accelerator is not a decision-making body or a new organization, it works to speed up collaborative efforts among existing organizations to end the pandemic.
pillar, co-convened by the Global Fund and FIND, is focused on bringing to market 2–3 high-quality rapid tests, training 10 000 healthcare professionals across 50 countries and establishing testing for 500 million people in Low and Middle-Income countries by mid-2021.
The therapeutics pillar is led by Unitaid and The Wellcome Trust.
The aim in the next 12 months is to develop, manufacture and distribute 245 million treatments, helping COVID-19 sufferers to recover from the disease.
The vaccinespillar, convened by CEPI, Gavi and WHO,is speeding up the search for an effective vaccine for all countries.
At the same time, it is supporting the building of manufacturing capabilities, and buying supply, ahead of time so that 2 billion doses can be?
fairly distributed by the end of 2021.
The health systems connector pillar, led by the World Bank and the Global Fund, is working to ensure that these tools can reach the people who need them.
Cross cutting all of these is the workstream on Access & Allocation, hosted by the World Health Organization.
Global partnership to make available 120 million affordable, quality COVID-19 rapid tests for low- and middle-income countries
A full access package includes WHO policy guidance on the use of antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests, manufacturer volume guarantees for low and middle-income countries, catalytic funding to assist governments to deploy the tests and an initial US$50 million procurement fund
Several rapid, point-of-care antigen tests are being assessed by WHO for Emergency Use Listing (EUL)
Agreements between the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and test manufacturers Abbott and SD Biosensor make available innovative tests priced at a maximum of US$5 for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)
The Global Fund commits an initial US$50 million to enable countries to purchase the new tests, with the first orders expected to be placed this week
Expedited market introduction of these tests in multiple LMICs is being supported through the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), Unitaid, FIND, CHAI, and their partners
This is the latest move from the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator to develop, procure and distribute critical new tools to fight the pandemic; new tests are urgently needed to meet the huge unmet needs for testing worldwide
A set of agreements to make available, for low and middle-income countries, affordable, high-quality COVID-19 antigen rapid tests were today announced by the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator.
Organizations involved in the milestone agreement include the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), the Global Fund, Unitaid, and the World Health Organization (WHO).
As part of this comprehensive, end-to-end effort, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has executed separate volume guarantee agreements with rapid diagnostic test (RDT) producers Abbott and SD Biosensor.
These two arrangements will make available to LMICs 120 million antigen rapid diagnostic tests (Ag RDTs) – priced at a maximum of US$5 per unit – over a period of six months.
These tests provide results in 15–30 minutes, rather than hours or days, and will enable expansion of testing, particularly in countries that do not have extensive laboratory facilities or trained health workers to implement molecular (polymerase-chain reaction or PCR) tests.
The tests developed by Abbott and SD Biosensor are highly portable, reliable, and easy to administer, making testing possible in near-person, decentralized healthcare settings.
Both companies’ tests are faster and cheaper than laboratory-based tests, enabling countries to increase the pace of testing, tracing and treating people for COVID-19 at the point of care particularly in areas with under-resourced health systems.
A number of other Ag RDTs are at various stages of development and assessment.
To scale up the Ag RDTs, the Global Fund today announced that it has made available an initial US$50 million from its COVID-19 Response Mechanism to enable countries to purchase at least 10 million of the new rapid tests for LMICs at the guaranteed price, with the first orders expected to be placed this week through the Global Fund’s pooled procurement mechanism.
FIND and WHO are working together to accelerate appropriate use by supporting implementation research that will optimize Ag RDT use in multiple LMICs, in line with WHO guidance.
This includes provision of catalytic volumes of tests to understand how Ag RDTs can best fit into health systems.
Unitaid and Africa CDC will combine resources to initiate the roll out of these tests in up to 20 countries in Africa starting in October 2020.
This multi-million-dollar intervention, currently undergoing final sign-off by their Boards, is designed to engage multiple partners active in the COVID-19 response in these countries, such as CHAI, African Society for Laboratory Medicine (ASLM) and local organizations.
This will bolster efforts by the African Union’s Partnership to Accelerate COVID-19 Testing (PACT) initiative, launched in August 2020 to mobilize experts, community workers, supplies and other resources to minimize the impact of the pandemic on the African continent by testing, tracing, and treating COVID-19 cases in a timely manner.
Testing is a critical cornerstone of the COVID-19 response, enabling countries to trace and contain the virus now, and to prepare for the roll-out of vaccines once available.
Effective testing strategies rely on a portfolio of test types that can be used in different settings and situations.
While molecular tests started to be rolled out within a month of the virus being sequenced, these tests are mainly laboratory based, relying on infrastructure and trained personnel to conduct them.
Rapid tests to detect the presence of the virus at the point of care, which are faster and cheaper, are a vital addition to the testing arsenal needed to contain and fight COVID-19.
WHO guidance published on 11 September 2020 highlights the value of these tests in areas where community transmission is widespread and where nucleic acid amplification-based diagnostic (NAAT) testing is either unavailable or where test results are significantly delayed.
As well as supporting test-trace-isolate strategies, the tests can help identify or confirm new outbreaks, support outbreak investigations through screening; monitor disease trends; and potentially test asymptomatic contacts.
The ACT-Accelerator Diagnostics Pillar is co-convened by FIND and the Global Fund, working closely with WHO and over 30 global health expert partners to accelerate innovation and overcome the technical, financial, and political obstacles to achieving equitable access to effective and timely testing.
Such unprecedented global collaboration has enabled development and deployment of the first WHO EUL-approved Ag RDT within eight months of the first identification of the virus.
In comparison, it took nearly five years to develop the first RDT for HIV.
Several more antigen RDTs for COVID-19 are currently under WHO EUL review.
Overall, the ACT-Accelerator Diagnostic Pillar aims to facilitate the supply of 500 million tests to LMICs within 12 months.
These agreements are critical to fulfil the key objective of the ACT-Accelerator: to ensure all countries, regardless of income, have fair access to new tests and tools to fight COVID-19.
The exceptional speed with which the Ag RDT access package has been created demonstrates the breadth of the impact of the ACT-Accelerator initiative, and this and future achievements in testing will complement similar milestones anticipated to emerge from the Vaccines and Therapeutics Pillars.
Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO, said: “High-quality rapid tests show us where the virus is hiding, which is key to quickly tracing and isolating contacts and breaking the chains of transmission.
The tests are a critical tool for governments as they look to reopen economies and ultimately save both lives and livelihoods.
Mark Suzman, Chief Executive Officer of the Gates Foundation, said: “Testing is an essential tool in the fight against COVID-19.
We are delighted to join a partnership that will help ensure that the latest, high-quality diagnostics do not just go to the highest bidder but will be available at an affordable price to the world’s lower income countries.
In addition, all of the actions announced today point to the growing success of the ACT-Accelerator in catalyzing global cooperation for a fair and effective response to this global crisis.
Dr Iain Barton, Chief Executive Officer of CHAI, said: “These agreements will help ensure that millions of people in low- and middle-income countries have access to high-quality rapid testing in villages and towns as well as cities.
This has the potential to revolutionize government’s ability to respond to the pandemic, enabling quick diagnosis and response to contain localized virus outbreaks before they spread.
Andrea F.
Wainer, Executive Vice President of Abbott’s rapid and molecular diagnostics businesses, said: “Abbott is pleased to bring our Panbio COVID-19 rapid antigen test and Sympheos digital solution to people and health authorities in low- and middle-income countries through this innovative partnership.
We have long been committed to making sure our life-changing technologies are affordable and accessible, and for decades have been supporting many of these countries with our rapid tests for malaria, HIV, hepatitis, and other deadly infectious diseases.
Hyo-Keun Lee, Chief Executive Officer of SD Biosensor, said: “We, SD Biosensor, are pleased to supply our STANDARD Q COVID-19 rapid antigen tests for people who really need fast and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis.
Through this partnership, we will keep striving do our best to provide the best quality of COVID-19 antigen rapid kits for fighting COVID-19.
Dr John Nkengasong, Director of the Africa CDC, said: “Antigen tests are an important complement to PCR testing, and are crucial to expand testing capacity throughout Africa.
The beauty of antigen testing is that it is fast and gives quick results.
It will allow healthcare workers to quickly isolate cases and treat them while tracing their contacts to cut the transmission chain.
Dr Philippe Duneton, Unitaid’s Executive Director a.
i.,said: “Access to these point-of-care rapid tests with be a game changer in the fight against COVID-19.
We are working to support countries to rapidly deploy and use these new tests in the best possible way.
Today’s news shows what the ACT-A partners working together can deliver in our efforts against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Dr Carolyn Gomes, Special Advisor for the Board, ProActividad, Jamaica, and Alternate Board Member (Developing Country NGOs), The Global Fund “Ensuring equitable access to rapid diagnostic tests is essential for controlling COVID-19 in all countries and to opening up economies across the world.
Ensuring an affordable price is a major step forward.
Tests that can be used at the point of care by front-line workers will greatly facilitate community access to testing.
To ensure equity in access for those who need it most, there will need to be much greater support of the ACT-Accelerator and the Diagnostics Pillar in particular.
Much more money is needed to meet the needs of the most vulnerable.
Peter Sands, Executive Director of the Global Fund, said: “This is the ACT-Accelerator in action.
It is proof that by working together at a massive global scale, we can develop and deploy a vital new tool to help contain and fight the pandemic.
This is not just a new test – it’s the money and the deployment plan to get it to where it’s needed, fast.
This is the power of global collaboration.
Dr Catharina Boehme, Chief Executive Officer of FIND, said: “With this Ag RDT package, the ACT-Accelerator partners have secured much-needed tools for LMICs to dramatically increase COVID-19 testing.
With the financial support of several countries, we have made great progress, but to ensure we reach all those who need testing and bring the prices down, we urgently need substantial funding from public, philanthropic, and multilateral sources.
The Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is a new, ground-breaking global collaboration to accelerate the development production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.
It was set up in response to a call from G20 leaders in March 2020 and launched by WHO, the European Commission, France and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in April 2020.
The ACT-Accelerator is not a decision-making body or a new organization, but works to speed up collaborative efforts among existing organizations to end the pandemic.
The Diagnostics Pillar of the ACT-Accelerator is focused on ensuring that everyone who needs a test can get one.
Workstreams span research and development, market readiness, procurement, and country preparedness.
Achievements to date include laboratory trainings in partnership with Africa CDC in early February, and a suite of online courses deployed within weeks.
Nearly 20 million tests have been procured with the Diagnostics Consortium, ensuring diagnostic access for LMICs and readiness for test-and-treat implementation in these countries.
Independent evaluations of antibody tests are also being conducted, as high-quality antibody tests are essential to understand population immunity for future vaccine roll out.
Managing the COVID-19 infodemic: Promoting healthy behaviours and mitigating the harm from misinformation and disinformation
Joint statement by WHO, UN, UNICEF, UNDP, UNESCO, UNAIDS, ITU, UN Global Pulse, and IFRC
The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the first pandemic in history in which technology and social media are being used on a massive scale to keep people safe, informed, productive and connected.
At the same time, the technology we rely on to keep connected and informed is enabling and amplifying an infodemic that continues to undermine the global response and jeopardizes measures to control the pandemic.
An infodemic is an overabundance of information, both online and offline.
It includes deliberate attempts to disseminate wrong information to undermine the public health response and advance alternative agendas of groups or individuals.
Mis- and disinformation can be harmful to people’s physical and mental health; increase stigmatization; threaten precious health gains; and lead to poor observance of public health measures, thus reducing their effectiveness and endangering countries’ ability to stop the pandemic.
Misinformation costs lives.
Without the appropriate trust and correct information, diagnostic tests go unused, immunization campaigns (or campaigns to promote effective vaccines) will not meet their targets, and the virus will continue to thrive.
Furthermore, disinformation is polarizing public debate on topics related to COVID-19; amplifying hate speech; heightening the risk of conflict, violence and human rights violations; and threatening long-terms prospects for advancing democracy, human rights and social cohesion.
In this context, the UN Secretary- General launched the United Nations Communications Response initiative to combat the spread of mis- and disinformation in April 2020.
The UN also issued a Guidance Note on Addressing and Countering COVID-19 related Hate Speech (11 May 2020).
At the World Health Assembly in May 2020, WHO Member States passed Resolution WHA73.
1 on the COVID-19 response.
The Resolution recognizes that managing the infodemic is a critical part of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic: it calls on Member States to provide reliable COVID-19 content, take measures to counter mis- and disinformation and leverage digital technologies across the response.
The Resolution also calls on international organizations to address mis- and disinformation in the digital sphere, work to prevent harmful cyber activities undermining the health response and support the provision of science-based data to the public.
The UN system and civil society organizations are using their collective expertise and knowledge to respond to the infodemic.
At the same time, as the pandemic continues to create uncertainty and anxiety, there is an urgent need for stronger action to manage the infodemic, and for a coordinated approach among states, multi-lateral organizations, civil society and all other actors who have a clear role and responsibility in combatting mis- and disinformation.
We call on Member States to develop and implement action plans to manage the infodemic by promoting the timely dissemination of accurate information, based on science and evidence, to all communities, and in particular high-risk groups; and preventing the spread, and combating, mis- and disinformation while respecting freedom of expression.
We urge Member States to engage and listen to their communities as they develop their national action plans, and to empower communities to develop solutions and resilience against mis- and disinformation.
We further call on all other stakeholders - including the media and social media platforms through which mis- and disinformation are disseminated, researchers and technologists who can design and build effective strategies and tools to respond to the infodemic, civil society leaders and influencers - to collaborate with the UN system, with Member States and with each other, and to further strengthen their actions to disseminate accurate information and prevent the spread of mis- and disinformation.
Boost for global response to COVID-19 as economies worldwide formally sign up to COVAX facility
64 higher income economies have now joined the COVAX Facility, with a further 38 economies expected to sign in the coming days
These self-financing economies, which include 29 from ‘Team Europe’ participating as part of an agreement with the European Commission, join 92 lower income economies eligible for financial support through the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment
This means a total of 156 economies, representing nearly two-thirds of the global population, are now committed to or eligible to receive vaccines through the Facility Click here for the list of economies
64 higher income economies have joined the COVAX Facility, a global initiative that brings together governments and manufacturers to ensure eventual COVID-19 vaccines reach those in greatest need, whoever they are and wherever they live.
These 64 economies include commitments from 35 economies as well as the European Commission which will procure doses on behalf of 27 EU member states plus Norway and Iceland.
By pooling financial and scientific resources, these participating economies will be able to insure themselves against the failure of any individual vaccine candidate and secure successful vaccines in a cost-effective, targeted way.
The 64 members of the Facility will be joined by 92 low- and middle-income economies eligible for support for the procurement of vaccines through the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC), a financing instrument aimed at supporting the procurement of vaccines for these countries.
This means that 156 economies, representing roughly 64% of the global population in total, are now either committed to or eligible for the COVAX Facility, with more to follow.
With the Commitment Agreements secured, the COVAX Facility will now start signing formal agreements with vaccine manufacturers and developers, which are partners in the COVAX effort, to secure the doses needed to end the acute phase of the pandemic by the end of 2021.
This is in addition to an ongoing effort to raise funding for both R&D and for the procurement of vaccines for lower-income countries via the Gavi COVAX AMC.
“COVAX is now in business: governments from every continent have chosen to work together, not only to secure vaccines for their own populations, but also to help ensure that vaccines are available to the most vulnerable everywhere,” said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which is coordinating the COVAX Facility.
“With the commitments we’re announcing today for the COVAX Facility, as well as the historic partnership we are forging with industry, we now stand a far better chance of ending the acute phase of this pandemic once safe, effective vaccines become available.
The COVAX Facility is part of COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, which is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the World Health Organization (WHO) – working in partnership with developed and developing country vaccine manufacturers, UNICEF, the World Bank, Civil Society Organisations and others.
The allocation of vaccines, once licensed and approved, will be guided by an Allocation Framework released today by WHO following the principle of fair and equitable access, ensuring no participating economy will be left behind.
Policies determining the prioritization of vaccine rollout within economies will be guided by recommendations from the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), which has recently released a Values Framework laying the groundwork for subsequent guidance on target populations and policies on vaccine use.
“COVID-19 is an unprecedented global crisis that demands an unprecedented global response,” said WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
“Vaccine nationalism will only perpetuate the disease and prolong the global recovery.
Working together through the COVAX Facility is not charity, it’s in every country’s own best interests to control the pandemic and accelerate the global economic recovery.
The commitment of fully self-financing economies will now unlock vital funding and the security of demand needed to scale up manufacturing and secure the doses needed for the Facility.
CEPI is leading COVAX vaccine research and development work, which aims to develop at least three safe and effective vaccines which can be made available to economies participating in the COVAX Facility.
Nine candidate vaccines are currently being supported by CEPI; eight of which are currently in clinical trials.
“This is a landmark moment in the history of public health with the international community coming together to tackle this pandemic.
The global spread of COVID-19 means that it is only through equitable and simultaneous access to new lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines that we can hope to end this pandemic”, said Dr Richard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI.
“Countries coming together in this way shows a unity of purpose and resolve to end the acute phase of this pandemic, and we must now work closely with vaccine manufacturers—who play an integral part in the global response—to put in place the agreements needed to fulfil COVAX’s core aim: to have two billion vaccine doses available by the end of 2021.
Today, we have taken a great leap towards that goal, for the benefit of all.
The success of COVAX hinges not only on economies signing up to the COVAX Facility and commitments from vaccine manufacturers, but also filling key funding gaps for both COVAX research and development (R&D) work and the Gavi COVAX AMC to support participation of lower income economies in the COVAX Facility.
Governments, vaccine manufacturers (in addition to their own R&D), organisations and individuals have committed US$ 1.
4 billion towards vaccine R&D so far, but a further US$ 700-800 million is urgently needed to continue to move the portfolio forward in addition to US$ 300 million to fund WHO’s SOLIDARITY trial.
The Gavi COVAX AMC has raised around US$ 700 million from sovereign donors as well as philanthropy and the private sector, against an initial target of US$ 2 billion in seed funding needed by the end of 2020.
Funding the Gavi COVAX AMC will be critical to ensuring ability to pay is not a barrier to accessing COVID-19 vaccines, a situation which would leave the majority of the world unprotected, with the pandemic and its impact continuing unabated.
The Commitment Agreements also commit higher income governments to provide an upfront payment to reserve doses by 9 October 2020.
These funds will be used to accelerate the scale-up of vaccine manufacturing to secure two billion doses of vaccine, enough to vaccinate one billion people assuming the vaccine requires a two-dose regimen.
Further details on these upfront payments are available in Gavi’s COVAX Facility Explainer.
As well as procuring doses for participating economies, the COVAX Facility will also maintain a buffer of doses for emergency and humanitarian use.
Participating country comments
“COVID-19 poses serious health concerns to people everywhere, and that’s why Canada is committed to working with partners around the world to end the pandemic,” said the Rt.
Hon.
Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada.
“Equitable, timely, and affordable access to a safe and effective COVID vaccine will be critical to help protect people’s health.
Canada supports the objectives and principles of the COVAX Facility as the only global pooled procurement mechanism for countries to collaborate on this monumental undertaking.
Our country is a part of this important global response.
“New Zealand’s commitment to the COVAX Facility supports access to vaccines against COVID-19 for other countries too,” said Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern, Prime Minister of New Zealand.
“COVAX and the idea of equal access to a COVID-19 vaccine, regardless of ability to pay, is not just a moral imperative, it is the only practical solution to this pandemic.
Protecting everyone is the only way we can return our world – our trade, tourism, travel, business – to normal,” said the Honourable Dr Edwin G.
Dikoloti, Minister of Health and Wellness for Botswana.
“We urge those countries who have not yet signed up to do so.
Let us work together to protect each other.
“Immunisation saves lives.
Investing in immunisation infrastructure helps strengthen health systems.
We have seen this time and again through our work with Gavi and Alliance partners,” said Dr Lia Tadesse, Minister of Health for Ethiopia.
“By being a part of the COVAX Facility and the AMC we can continue this work and protect our citizens - and the world - against the impact of COVID-19.
“With COVAX, the world is joining forces and proving that together, we are stronger – and together, we can defeat this pandemic,” said Ekaterine Tikaradze, Minister of Health for Georgia.
“Georgia will be joining the COVAX Facility to give our citizens the best chance at having access to safe vaccines.
By doing this, we also make sure health care workers and other high risk persons all over the world have access to these life-saving tools, helping to bring the pandemic under control – and we can all recover and rebuild.
“Joining the COVAX Facility was not a difficult decision – not only will this give Kuwaiti citizens access to COVID-19 vaccines as they become available, it will also mean our friends and partners outside our borders also get access,” said His Excellency Sheikh Dr Basel Humoud Al-Sabah, Minister of Health of the State of Kuwait.
“We need a global solution to this global pandemic: we believe COVAX is that solution.
“We believe international cooperation – a global effort – is key,” said Dag-Inge Ulstein, Minister of International Development for Norway.
“We must continue to work for equitable access to vaccines, tests and treatments.
To defeat the coronavirus pandemic, well-off countries need to act swiftly and boldly to make vaccines and treatments available to those who cannot afford to pay themselves.
With the commitments to the COVAX facility we are heading in the right direction.
“This is a hugely important initiative, which could offer us a path out of the acute phase of this pandemic and a return to normality,” said His Excellency Dr Ahmed Mohammed Obaid Al Saidi, Minister of Health of the Sultanate of Oman.
“I would urge every country that has not yet done so to sign up, for all our sakes.
It is far better for us to work together than apart.
Partner comments
“The history of vaccines will be defined by our response to COVID-19; the COVAX facility is at the epicenter of this response.
Industry is at the forefront in vaccines development and manufacturing leading to supplies of several billion doses within the next few years”, said Mr. Sai D. Prasad, President of the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers’ Network (DCVMN).
“The COVAX facility will have a major impact on lives, livelihoods and accelerate the return to normalcy for countries.
The DCVMN is fully engaged with its partners to enhance its mission of global public health and to leave no one behind.
“It is very encouraging to see so many countries move from talk to full commitment,” said Thomas Cueni, Director General of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (IFPMA).
“The Facility can only work, and equitable access can only be achieved, if there is solidarity between rich and poorer countries.
Today vaccine makers who have the unique skills and expertise to scale up manufacturing to levels never seen before, stand ready, together, to take up the challenge of providing two billion doses of yet unknown COVID-19 vaccines.
This is no mean feat, as it requires doubling existing capacity in record time.
Today, marks a significant step forward, and is a historic mark of solidarity which has the power to bring the acute phase of this pandemic to an end; and we are proud to be part of this unique endeavour to leave no one behind.
“Uniting our efforts through COVAX must guarantee fair allocation and equitable delivery of the COVID-19 vaccine to those who need it most, and not just those who can afford it,” said Jagan Chapagain, Secretary-General of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
“We all have a moral and public health imperative to protect the poor in rural communities as the affluent in cities, the old in care homes as the young in refugee camps.
The power of our humanity and the success of COVAX will be measured by how we collectively protect the most vulnerable among us.
"Global cooperation must be the cornerstone of our global response to COVID-19,” said Kevin Watkins, Chief Executive of Save the Children.
“The COVAX Facility has the potential to help ensure universal and equitable access to future COVID vaccines.
For this to happen, we need to ensure people in low- and middle-income countries get their fair share and can access the vaccines they need to help overcome the biggest public health and child rights crisis of our generation.
“Seeing such unity in the face of the COVID-19 crisis gives us confidence that, together, we can ensure the equitable delivery of COVID vaccines globally,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director.
“With our globe-spanning supply chain and on-the-ground presence across 190 countries, UNICEF is proud to support this historic effort.
