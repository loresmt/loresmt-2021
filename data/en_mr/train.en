In the first two months after the corona infection spread in the state, the hospital started experiencing a huge shortage of PPE kits and masks.
PPE kits, masks were the shield of health workers in the war against corona.
However, a member of the Mard, an association of resident doctors at the Mumbai Municipal Hospital, Dr. Deepak Mundhe says, "There may have been a shortage of PPE kits elsewhere in the state except Mumbai.
In India, coronavirus is more prevalent among people from abroad.
We needed to seal the international border.

Corona, a resident doctor at the municipal hospital, was providing medical services to patients in March, April and May.
Dr. Nagpur. Lina Kalmegh says, "It cannot be said that government hospitals failed during the Corona period.

* Controlled hospital treatment
* Toll free number announced after increasing demand for drugs like Remedivir.
* Steps taken to control prices of N-95 masks.
* RTPCR test made available at affordable rates.

Budget: Why and how did Maharashtra's economic situation deteriorate?
The state budget will be presented to the legislature today (March 8).
If the question of which is the number one state in the country is asked, different claims are likely to be made by the ruling party and the opposition in Maharashtra.
However, your Maharashtra is not the number one state in the country at present.
The states of Haryana, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are far ahead of Maharashtra in terms of GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product).
Looking at the economic survey reports released in the last 10 years, the state was in good shape till 2013.
But from 2012-13, the situation began to change.
After that, however, Maharashtra could not maintain the number one position.
Why and how it happened.
Although Maharashtra's growth rate has not increased faster than other states, it has not slowed down.
Neglect of agriculture
But if we study by sector, the agribusiness in Maharashtra has shown negative growth in the last few years, says Dr. Aditi says.
Spraying without safety devices
Some of the research I have done on agriculture has come to light.
The main reason why Maharashtra is lagging behind
There are various reasons why Maharashtra's economy is lagging behind other states, said senior economist Dr. Yashwant Thorat speaks to BBC Marathi.
Here are 5 key reasons why.
Lack of proper policies
Lack of proper spending
Lack of properly trained workers
Corruption
Lack of strategic decisions to strengthen the state’s economy
If our policies and spending are not sustainable, it is detrimental to the state if the policies and spending we are doing are not reflected on the ground, says Thorat.
"The governments that came to Maharashtra after 2010 did not spend the funds properly.
Thorat feels that the state's fiscal deficit is huge, but if the money had been spent in the right place, it would have paid off.
'Why is Maharashtra lagging behind in trained manpower?'
Speaking on the issue of workers, Thorat recounts his experiences.
He says, "Many churches come to us to ask for jobs.
He recounts his experience in a hotel in Konkan.
As an Indian, I am happy that people from the Northeast have come to work in Konkan.
Proper manpower training is the issue.
After agriculture, construction industry is the most important sector in Maharashtra in terms of job creation, she says.
The most important sector in terms of job creation in Maharashtra is the construction industry.
But this area can be revived, said Dr. Aditi thinks.
Currently, the Maharashtra government has significantly relaxed the stamp duty.
Failure to attract industries
Thorat also feels that there is a lack of policies in Maharashtra to attract industries.
Maharashtra used to have all kinds of industries.
"The corona makes no one visible at the gateway
At the same time, corruption is one of the main reasons.
At the same time, Dr. Aditi points out the declining importance of the Mumbai port in the last few years.
The port of Mumbai is a very important destination for international maritime traffic.
'Tourism can save Maharashtra'
The state of Maharashtra has a huge historical, religious and natural heritage.
Caves of Ajanta Ellora
Compared to Maharashtra, the states in South India have strengthened their economy through tourism by conserving religious and historical sites.
'Maharashtra will be No. 1 again'
But Rajesh Kshirsagar, chairman of the state's planning board, blames the previous government for the situation.
Uddhav Thackeray, Devendra Fadnavis, Shiv Sena, BJP
In the last five years, the BJP government has focused on how all the economy in Maharashtra will go to Gujarat.
But global economic growth is slowing, as are oil prices.
Meanwhile, Kshirsagar claims that "the government is now paying more attention to how investment has increased.

However, current coronary heart disease does not appear to have reduced the infection so quickly.
Dr. Speaking to BBC Marathi, Bhondwe said, "There is no rush for preventive vaccination against corona.
Or it may have occasional outbreaks in those areas.
The corona vaccine does not mean that the disease will go away immediately.
'The second wave of corona is coming', the Center gave 15 suggestions to Maharashtra
The second wave of corona has started in Maharashtra, the secretary of the Union Ministry of Health has sent a letter to Maharashtra.
Very little efficient efforts are being made in contact tracing, segregation, segregation and testing, the health secretary lamented.
A team from the Union Health Department visited various parts of Maharashtra from March 7 to 11 and inspected the situation there.
The second wave of corona begins in Maharashtra - Central Government
In a summary written at the end of the letter, the Union Health Secretary said that the second wave of Kovid 19 global epidemic has started in Maharashtra.
Not much active efforts are being made to locate, trace and isolate patients and quarantine those who come in contact with them.
In order to prevent or stop this spread of covid, the administrative mechanism should be activated in August-September 2020, the Center said in its letter.
All key components and guidelines outlined in the following instructions should be strictly followed.
15 instructions given by the central team to the state government:
1) Working groups should be set up once again under the leadership of District Collector and Municipal Commissioner to prevent infection and transmission of Corona virus.
2) Patients and those who come in contact with them should be searched from door to door in the containment areas.
3) At least 20 to 30 persons who came in contact with a patient who tested positive should be traced.
4) The number of corona tests needs to be increased.
5) The policies for containment should be reconsidered.
6) The policy of keeping 80 to 85 per cent of the active cases in home isolation should be reviewed.
7) While isolating the patient at home, it should be checked whether any of the family members who are quarantined at home are in the high-risk group.
8) Even if the infrastructure in the health system is adequate now, it should be prepared by considering what will be needed if the situation worsens.
9) Treatment protocols should be reviewed with the doctors treating the patients.
10) The number of deaths of patients admitted for treatment in Vasantrao Pawar Medical College, Nashik is high.
11) Death audit should be resumed.
12) Frontline workers are not keen on vaccination.
13) The state government needs to speed up the vaccination of senior citizens and those with chronic diseases.
14) A large public awareness campaign should be carried out to know what precautions should be taken while using to prevent covid 19.
15) Measures like night curfew, weekend lockdown do not have much effect in preventing or controlling the infection.
Corona virus: How and why is the number of covid 19 patients increasing in Maharashtra?
Remember the game of hide and seek? The one who has the kingdom in it is trying to find those who are hiding.
Is corona virus playing a similar game in Maharashtra at present?
Epidemiologists call this the 'second wave' of epidemics.
What is the exact status of Kovid-19 epidemic in the state?
Rapid increase in the number of patients in Maharashtra
In Maharashtra, the eruption of Kovid had reached its peak in September last year.
See this graph from January.
As many as 25,681 corona patients were registered during the day on Friday, March 19.
Outbreaks appear to be exacerbated in rural areas
When Kovid came to Maharashtra, initially the number of patients was higher in urban areas.
Amravati had about 3,000 active patients on September 24 when the rate of infection was at its highest during the first wave of the epidemic.
In the rural areas, a large number of people had turned out in the Gram Panchayat elections held a few weeks ago.
In the months of January and February, many restrictions were further relaxed, local trains in Mumbai started.
Maharashtra currently has 61 per cent patients in the country
About eight to nine per cent of the total population of India lives in Maharashtra.
As on March 19, 2021, the number of active patients in the country is currently 2 lakh 68 thousand 692 people who have been affected by covid.
Considering the total number of patients, 1 crore 15 lakh 14 thousand 331 patients were registered in the country till March 19, 2021.
In particular, considering the testing statistics, a total of 23 crore 13 lakh 70 thousand 540 inspections were carried out in the country till March 19, out of which only seven per cent or 1 crore, 79 lakh, 56 thousand 830 inspections were done in Maharashtra.
Maharashtra ranks fourth in the world
Why this situation is so worrisome in Maharashtra will be seen in this table.
Considering the total number of covid patients by province, Maharashtra ranks fourth in the world.
Testing in Maharashtra increased again
As the number of covid patients has increased in the state, so has the number of check-ups.
On September 27 last year, 1 lakh 88 thousand people in the state underwent covid test.
But the test positivity rate has also increased, indicating how many of them were actually infected with the corona virus.
Across the country, the current test positivity rate is around five per cent, while in Maharashtra it is 14 to 15 per cent.
The higher the test positivity rate, the higher the risk.
Contact tracing is just as important as investigation to gain control over the disease.
The death toll rose, but the death toll remained low
In the last three months, the number of deaths due to covid in Maharashtra has also started rising again.
But the reassuring thing is that Covid's mortality rate is still low.
Between August and October, more than 200 to 300 deaths were reported daily in the state.
In percentage terms, the death toll has come down from 2.47 per cent in October to 0.44 per cent in the first fortnight of March.
State Chief Survey Officer Dr. Pradip Awate writes about it on Facebook, "Actually, there shouldn't be a single death, because drowning is so sad for the person in whose house it happens.
Is there adequate vaccination in Maharashtra?
Another plus side during the second wave of covid is that vaccines are now available on the corona virus.
Vaccination has also started in the state since January and vaccination is being carried out expeditiously.
But in order to control the epidemic, vaccination needs to be accelerated, experts say.
What about virus mutations, genome sequencing?
In Maharashtra, the second wave of Kovid's epidemic is spreading rapidly.
Such changes occur in viruses or in any cell.
By constantly sequencing the genome, it is possible to predict exactly what changes are taking place in the virus and how much more dangerous it has become.
But the rate of genome sequencing in India is still very low.

After entering the examination hall, spray sanitizer on your space.
Let the mask be on the face constantly.
Don't think too much of Covid once the paper starts.
Between the two papers ...
The exam consists of two papers and there is a break between the two papers.
Don't go outside the examination center.
No matter how much you want to discuss the question paper, it should be avoided.
After the exam is over

So don't be under the illusion that the exam is over.
In the end, it may or may not be cowardly even at the time of the main exam after this exam.
This will further help the government in planning the examinations at the time of the main examination.

Indifference among people is dangerous for everyone - Kishori Pednekar
Over the past few months, there has been a lot of speculation about the corona.
We know that there is a mini-lockdown in Pune.
Foreign workers from Mumbai went to the village
Foreign workers from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar in Mumbai have gathered at Lokmanya Tilak Terminus to return to the village.
Hearing that there will be another lockdown in Maharashtra, these workers have left for the village.

SSC-HSC board exams: Students say, 'You are endangering the lives of 30 lakh families'
You are endangering not only 30 lakh students but 30 lakh families.
Alternative examination methods could have been considered over the last year instead of written examinations.
Many such questions are being asked by the students of class X-XII.
We are not opposed to exams but should consider other options than going out for written exams.
Strict restrictions in the state and a complete lockdown on the weekends.
The 10th and 12th board exams will start in Maharashtra from the third week of April.
The 10th exam will be held from April 29 to May 21 and the 12th exam will be held from April 23 to May 20.
The government announced strict restrictions on Sunday (April 4) against the backdrop of rising corona patients in the state.
About 30 lakh students will appear for the board exams this year.
Anyway, why did the government decide to take the exams of nearly 30 lakh students at a time when the number of corona patients in the state is reaching a record high every day?
What is the government's plan so far for taking the exam?
The 10th and 12th board examinations will be held in April and May under the nine divisional boards of the State Board of Education (Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Kolhapur, Latur, Konkan, Amravati).
The state government has made it clear that the board's exams will be an exception to the newly imposed strict restrictions and the weekend lockdown.
In the background of these tests, it has been made mandatory for the academic staff to vaccinate the teachers and other staff or to bring with them a report that the Corona's RTPCR tested negative 48 hours before the test.
But how will the students reach the examination centers when there is a complete lockdown as many papers of the students come on Saturday?
Do students want to wear masks in a row for three to three and a half hours of exams?
Speaking to BBC Marathi, Varsha Gaikwad, Minister for School Education, said that if a student gets infected with corona during the examination, if any member of his family gets infected with corona or comes in contact with coronavirus, the concerned student will get a second chance to appear for the examination in June.
However, the education department has not yet announced the rules and regulations required for board students to appear for the exams in June.
As a relief to the students, the education department has extended the written test by half an hour.
If the exams are postponed, the next academic year may also be postponed.
What exactly are the objections of board students?
Some board students in Pune, Nashik, Nagpur and Mumbai in the state have expressed opposition to taking the written test.
These exams have also been excluded from the new restrictions of the government.
Speaking to BBC Marathi, Saloni Kamble, who is studying in 12th Science, said, "While the number of patients in Maharashtra is increasing tremendously, the board is pushing for written exams.
On the other hand, the students are also faced with the question of how to travel by public transport.
Sujata Angarkhe will also appear for the Class XII examination.
She adds, "On the other hand, the government is acknowledging that there is a strain on the health system.
How will we take the exam during the Corona period?
Speaking to BBC Marathi, Jeet said, "Our parents are worried about us.
Many students also feel that the state government could have considered several options throughout the year
We can be given homework or assignments, we can have open book exams, we can decide on the marks of class XI.
This exam is very important for 12th standard students.
What do teachers and experts think?
Just as there is confusion among the students, there is also an atmosphere of confusion and anxiety among the teachers.
Speaking to BBC Marathi, Bhausaheb Chaskar, a Zilla Parishad teacher and writer on educational issues, said, "The current situation has become very serious due to the massive contagion of Kovid.
Students have been learning through online learning throughout the year.
Speaking on the occasion, Bhausaheb Chaskar says, "Teachers have not been able to reach out to many students in rural areas due to lack of online learning facilities.
Our education system is exam-centric.
Given the place and special importance of the 10th-12th written examination in school education, there are no other options for the written examination.
How challenging can it be for the board to take the exam at such a time?
Speaking to BBC Marathi, Laxmikant Pandey, former president of the State Board of Education, Mumbai (Board), said:
Other options for taking the exam may also be considered.
He goes on to say, "Teachers will take proper care of Corona's background.
What did the school education minister say?
For the last several days, students of the board have been protesting against the written exams in various districts of the state like Pune, Nashik and Mumbai.
In an interview to BBC Marathi, Varsha Gaikwad said, "Students from districts where there is a complete lockdown will be considered.
He also clarified in this interview that he will not reconsider the decision of the 10th and 12th board examinations.
Failure to take board exams can lead to big questions for students in the future.
If students have corona during this period, a special examination will be held for them in June.
Students who are corona positive, have a corona positive at home, or live in a containment zone, or have a lockdown in their area, will have the opportunity to take the test in June.
But who is responsible if the students get corona?
It was demanded that the board exam should be conducted online instead of offline.
So we thought of all the kids rather than the online exam.
MPSC: 'Students are preparing by eating rice, under corona'
' Due to the new restrictions, the mess closes at 6 p.m.
There is a joint pre-examination on April 11 for the posts of PSI, Assistant Sales Tax Officer, Ministry Assistant.
But since the last week of March, the number of corona patients in the state, including Pune, has increased tremendously.
Students say they have symptoms and are not testing the corona.
The state of the meal on the one hand and the danger of the corona on the other
On the one hand, due to the restrictions imposed by the government, students are suffering from meals, on the other hand, many students are suffering from corona.
Students must be in good mental and physical health to take the exam.
Rasika Malmule, who lives with her friend in Narayan Peth, is currently preparing meals in the room.
Because the exams are often postponed, it is not possible to say when they will go ahead.
Why do students get corona infection?
Since many students live in the same room, if one gets infected with the corona, the other children get infected.
Speaking to BBC Marathi, Ajit Malve, who went to the village for fear of lockdown, said, "I have now left the village due to the previous lockdown.
I was living with friends in Pune.
Mahesh Gharbude, who is undergoing treatment at the Jumbo Covid Center in Pune, feels that the exam should be postponed.
He further said, "Students are demanding postponement of exams.
On the other hand, if the exams are not held, the students will stay together in Pune and the infection will increase again, says Nitin Mete.
Why is there a demand to postpone the MPSC exam?
The MPSC Coordinating Committee has demanded postponement of the examination to be held on April 1.
Speaking to BBC Marathi, Rahul Kavthekar, a member of the committee, said, "Many students do not take corona tests even though they are positive.
He added, "Students in Pune staged agitation last month.
What to take care of?
Health officials are also urging MPSC students not to shy away from testing for corona if they are exposed to it.
If students have symptoms, they need to have a corona test.
Corona vaccine: Will everyone above 25 years of age get corona vaccine as demanded by Uddhav Thackeray?
As the number of corona infections in Maharashtra and across the country is increasing rapidly, the government has started imposing restrictions as a last resort.
Vaccination has started in the country, but it is natural that it will take time for the vaccine to reach everyone in the 130 crore country.
From April 1, everyone over the age of 45 will be vaccinated across the country.
More than 82 lakh people have been vaccinated in Maharashtra so far and the campaign, which started on April 1, is vaccinating 3 to 4 lakh people daily across the state.
But the government says the condition is serious and the age limit should be reduced.
'Corona infection affects young people '
Uddhav Thackeray said in a press release after writing the letter, "Corona infection seems to be affecting a large number of young people and this age group also needs to be protected from the virus.
At the same time, the government is preparing to vaccinate people over the age of 45 more quickly within three weeks of a limited lockdown.
Uddhav had earlier in a meeting of the Prime Ministers demanded vaccination of persons above 45 years of age.
On the other hand, Raj Thackeray has also demanded that the age limit for vaccination be removed.
It is not just the government and political parties that are pushing for lowering the age limit for the corona vaccine.
Immunization is by far the only evidence-based measure to prevent infection.
Sir , inclusive of no scientific evidence that vaccination '
The Maharashtra government has suggested a comprehensive vaccination option, but the views of the central government and its experts do not appear to be conducive to these demands at present.
It will not be open to everyone at this time.
Speaking at a press conference at the Union Ministry of Health in Delhi on Tuesday, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, Vaccination is not a priority for those who want it, but for those who need it more.
Many of these countries are still vaccinating only senior citizens and those with other ailments.
The Policy Commission, which works with the Ministry of Health on the country's cowardly policy, also has a negative view on lowering the age limit for vaccination.
Member of the Policy Commission, Dr. V. K. "We have to look at this demand from a scientific point of view.
Paul adds, "All we know is that vaccines reduce mortality and reduce inflammation.
Therefore, the focus is now on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with the Chief Ministers of all the states on Thursday regarding covid control.
"Second #rd highest wave of the 22 to 45 age group patients'
Although the central government is not yet ready to lower the age limit, many experts, especially in Maharashtra, are in favor.
The second wave we see in Maharashtra is most likely due to a new mutant, a mutated virus.
Secondly, we want to vaccinate 130 crore people.
Dr. of the All India Drug Action Network working in the field of health.
She goes on to say, "I am of the opinion that vaccination should be used judiciously and I am not saying that it should not be given to anyone.
At the same time, we are spending a lot of money on vaccinations.
Corona Lockdown: Will Uddhav Thackeray relax restrictions for traders and shopkeepers?
Another challenge facing the state government now is the growing opposition to sanctions in the face of increasing cases of corona infection in Maharashtra and the ongoing controversy between the central and state governments over vaccination.
Opposition parties, which initially co-operated with the sanctions, have now changed their stance.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday called a meeting of all traders and hotel operators' associations.
Sharad Pawar also suggested to follow the restrictions in his Facebook Live keeping in mind the reality.
'Decide till Thursday, otherwise we will open shop on Friday'
Today there are reports of agitations of traders and shopkeepers from many cities in the state.
FNCCI president Fatehchand Ranka had warned the state government in response.
There was a meeting of 57 different trade associations in our federation.
The administration has made a sudden announcement without any thought.
The agitation of traders is not happening only in Pune.
In Mumbai too, there is opposition to the manner in which many trade associations have imposed restrictions.
We urge the chief minister to allow all shops to remain open from Monday to Friday and to announce a strict lockdown on Saturdays and Sundays.
In fact, after a meeting with Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday, BC Bharatiya, national president of the Confederation of All India Traders, said in a statement that the traders had advised the government to keep the shops open at different times.
Instead of keeping everything closed, offices, shops, markets should be allowed to open at different times.
According to the trade representatives present at the meeting, Uddhav Thackeray has assured that the government will take a decision in two days.
'Don't use street language'
The state government is mired in increasing cases on the one hand and opposition to lockdowns on the other.
Let's think about what measures can be taken quietly without taking any risks.
Seeing the growing opposition of the business community to the restrictions, Sharad Pawar also had to fall into this issue.
Opposition from political parties
Before the limited lockdown in Maharashtra, Chief Minister Thackeray had spoken to the Leader of the Opposition.
Devendra Fadnavis has written a letter to the Chief Minister asking the government to reconsider these restrictions and take a decision.
This demand has been made not only by the opposition but also by the ministers in the government.
The central government has asked the Maharashtra government to take strict measures to prevent the infection.

Corona virus: Why is a night curfew imposed? What did he achieve?
Tell me one thing, Tai ... is the corona virus only the most active at night?
Rashi, who was returning home late at night from the office, asked me.
Besides Maharashtra, night curfew has been imposed in Delhi, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and some districts in Uttar Pradesh.
In Maharashtra, night curfew has been imposed from 8 pm to 7 am.
But what is the reason for doing so?
According to BBC Marathi correspondent Mayank Bhagwat, a large number of people go out at night for fun, go to nightclubs, eat in restaurants.
Number of patients in Mumbai
The Delhi government has also imposed a night curfew, but no reason has been given.
There are many doubts in the minds of ordinary citizens about this night curfew.
We asked 3 expert doctors what were the reasons behind the night curfew.
Dr. Sanjay Rai
First Opinion - AIIMS Professor of Community Medicine Dr. Sanjay Rai
Night curfew is not a very effective way to curb the spread of corona virus.
Corona virus is spread in 3 ways .
The second type of infection is caused by foamite.
The third type of infection is caused by aerosols.
Since most infections are spread by droplets or frostbite, it is advisable to use a mask, keep a distance of two feet and wash your hands around the world.
Dr. Shekhar C. Mande
Another expert - Dr. Director General of CSIR. Shekhar Mande
CSIR - Council of Scientific and Industrial Research is monitoring the ongoing research on this global corona.
Dr. Shekhar Manden said, "People are more likely to go to confined spaces and this is one of the reasons for the spread of corona.
People should not go to such confined places at night, which is the scientific reason for imposing night curfew.
When people don't listen, the government has to take steps to impose curfews at night.
Corona can be controlled by imposing night curfew, closing offices and restricting some financial transactions.
Doctor Jugal Kishor, Third Specialist - Dr. Jugal Kishor, Head, Department of Community Medicine, Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi
The imposition of a night curfew may be a small part of the government's larger strategy against the Corona.
The first thing is for people to stop going out for no reason, on their own.
State governments are using night curfews as a third option.
There is no research on how much night curfew alone reduces the risk of corona infection.
Information provided by the Central Government
Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan had sent a letter to the Maharashtra government on March 15, 2021.
It said the state government should pay attention to the containment strategy decided by the Union Health Ministry to stop the spread of corona.
Letter sent by Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan to the Government of Maharashtra on 15 March 2021
It is clear from this that the current night curfew is not being imposed on the instructions of the central government but on the instructions of the state governments.

The Covid Task Force is a committee of expert doctors.
Meanwhile, on Saturday (April 10), Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray held discussions with all party leaders.
If we want to stop the Corona disaster, we have to impose strict restrictions for a while.
What decision will Uddhav Thackeray take regarding implementation of lockdown in Maharashtra?
An important meeting was held today (April 11) to implement a complete lockdown in Maharashtra in the next few days.
The Covid Task Force is a committee of expert doctors.
On Saturday (April 10), Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray held discussions with all party leaders.
If we want to stop the Corona disaster, we have to impose strict restrictions for a while.
As per the information given by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on April 8,
As on March 1, 2021, 75,000 tests were being conducted every day in the state.
1.25 lakh RTPCR tests are being conducted daily.

From April 1 to April 7, the mortality rate is 0.55 per cent with 3 lakh 60 thousand 281 patients.
At present there are 5 lakh 1 thousand 559 active patients in the state.
4.32 percent of active patients are on oxygen while less than 1 percent of patients are on ventilators.
Based on all such information, how many days of lockdown is required to break the chain of corona virus infection?
Challenge in front of the government?
As the number of corona patients reaches its peak in the state, there was a consensus in the all-party meeting that the chain of infection will not be broken unless a complete lockdown is implemented.
In any case, the Uddhav Thackeray government may have to face the wrath of the business class, the working class and the employees.
The Federation of Retail Traders Welfare Association (FRTWA) has demanded the announcement of a package for traders.
Union president Viren Shah said, "If the government is to announce a complete lockdown, it needs to clarify at today's meeting what package (financial assistance) it will provide to traders.
Furthermore, trade unions are opposed to allowing online sales.
Our goods worth crores of rupees are lying in the shops.
The government announced some rules for workers in the restrictions that have been in place since April 5.
Over the past year, the working class has also faced crises ranging from salary cuts to job losses.
Therefore, on the one hand, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is facing the challenge of resolving the grievances of both the business class, which has been suffering losses for the past year, and the working class, which has been plagued by economic woes.
Decide to stop rail traffic?
In Mumbai, 95 per cent of the Western, Harbor and Central Railway services are currently operational and even ordinary passengers are allowed to travel at certain times.

It is the role of all to ensure that the poor, the working class and the underprivileged do not suffer while imposing strict restrictions.
The number of patients is increasing so fast that if we do not take a decision on lockdown today, a situation like lockdown will automatically arise tomorrow, said Uddhav Thackeray.

'... then people will take to the streets'
There should be restrictions.
However, the outbreak of the people should also be taken into consideration, said Devendra Fadnavis, Leader of the Opposition.
The sentiments of small business owners, retailers, hairdressers and other businesses need to be taken into account.
Fadnavis said some formulas need to be worked out as to which areas can run and with which options.

Corona: There are no ventilator beds in Pune and Nagpur.
The question arises as to whether the state's healthcare system is inadequate as corona infections continue to grow.
Recently, the state government had claimed that there was a shortage of vaccines.
Considering Pune, at present there is not a single bed with ventilator facility in Pune Municipal Corporation area.
A total of 543 ventilator beds were set up in Pune by government and private hospitals for the treatment of covid patients.
The situation in neighboring Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation is no different.
Similarly, there are only 43 ventilators left in Pune rural area at present.
This means that there is a shortage of ventilators in Pune compared to the number of patients and experts feel that the administration needs to address this.
Rising number of patients in Pune
On Friday (April 9), 58,993 new coronaviruses were found in Maharashtra.
At present there are 100051 (one lakh and fifty one) active corona patients in Pune.
In the Pune Municipal Corporation area, a total of 8598 beds have been provided in all the government and private hospitals for cowardly patients.
What causes this condition?
Patients hide their symptoms even after experiencing corona infection.
The responsibility of the Jumbo Covid Center in the Annasaheb Magar Stadium area of ​​Pimpri Chinchwad lies with Dr. Sangram owns Kapale's Medbrose Healthcare Company.
Dr. According to Kapale, the number of patients has been increasing rapidly in the last few days.
Dr. According to Sangram Kapale, about 52 deaths were reported in ten days at the Covid Center run by his company.
Former President of the Indian Medical Association, Dr. Avinash Bhondwe has also blamed the government for the situation.
Dr. According to Bhondwe, “This situation has arisen because the administration has not taken any lessons from the situation over the last year.
Both the state and the central government have neglected health issues in the past.
Social workers from Chakan, Dr. According to Vijay Gokule, both the administration and the citizens are responsible for this situation.
"Between October and January, there was a decline in the number of corona patients in the state.
This year’s Corona wave is even bigger than last year.
What is the solution?
We are trying to increase the number of ventilators at Pimpri Chinchwad Jumbo Covid Center.
Asked what are the options to prevent this situation of scarcity, he said, Currently, the number of critically ill patients is on the rise.
If patients are taken care of properly in this first stage, they will not have this time.
Patients are cared for at the Covid Center, he says.
There is a need to create a special mechanism for them.
Dr. Avinash Bhondwe also raised the same issue.
He says, "Monitoring of patients with home quarantine.
Similarly, in states where the prevalence of corona is not high, ventilators can be ordered immediately from those states.

He said, "Many messages from 10th and 12th class students are reaching us.
But some students say that postponing the exam is not a solution.
Saloni Kambli is studying in 12th Science in Mumbai.
The government should give another option to the written test and take the test so that the next admission process can be streamlined, says Saloni.
'Make the same decision for all students in the country'
To change the examination system of the board, the government will have to consider the examination system of other central boards as well.
Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant has demanded Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal to take equal decision for all board students in the country.

As Ashok Chavan, a senior minister in the government, raised this issue, its importance from the point of view of the government was also underlined.
Senior journalist Sandeep Pradhan has been working in the field of communication for more than a decade.
Over the last year, we have seen that no one has given any information, there has been a lot of talk and there has been a lot of confusion among the people.
Also, going further, Sandeep Pradhan also raised the issue of realistic information.
If people know how much medicine they have, how many beds they have, then there is both comfort and seriousness in people, says Sandeep Pradhan. 
If anyone in the government or in the ruling party starts giving information about a sudden lockdown, then there is a discrepancy.
Health: 'Lack of public awareness, it shouldn't be like that now'
Corona's crisis is basically a health crisis.
Health expert and Maharashtra President of Indian Medal Association, Dr. Talking to Avinash Bhondwe, we learned what mistakes we should avoid in the previous lockdown.
Dr. Avinash Bhondwe says, People don't just get corona.
Dr. Avinash Bhondwe goes on to say, "In the past, those with other ailments suffered a lot.
Dr. Avinash Bhondwe emphasizes on the issue of public awareness.
Also, "The government takes action against those who do not wear masks.
Dr. Avinash Bhondwe is always raising his voice for the rights of doctors.
After that, Dr. Bhondwe comments on the overall healthcare facilities.
He says, "Whenever there is a health crisis like Corona, it is impossible to do anything at the time.
We need to wake up now and start empowering our health system to fight diseases like corona.
In addition to communication, transportation is an important issue in the case of lockdown.
What exactly did the government do about transportation and avoid it from past experience, but this time after the announcement of lockdown and during lockdown, the issue of transport will not be the center of the problem?
Transport: 'Public transport should continue'
On April 11, the Mumbai Railway Police issued a statement.
The reason why this explanation is needed is well known.
BBC Marathi spoke to senior journalist and writer Rajendra Aklekar and reviewed the transport sector.
Rajendra Aklekar says, "Public transport should not be closed.
When there is a medical emergency, people will not rush if they are sure they can use the public transport system.
The closure of offices or other activities, of course, reduces the stress on the transport system and reduces congestion, says Akalekar.
Also, "Transport related to tourism should be stopped.
Rajendra Aklekar says, "All these things had caused confusion in the previous lockdown.
Meanwhile, Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar told BBC Marathi, "Mumbai Local may decide to allow only essential service personnel as it did last year.
Education: 'We need to focus on educating children'
Schools have been completely closed for the past year or so.
On the one hand, on the other hand, a large section of students in Maharashtra are in rural areas, where the Internet is far, even access to electricity is a difficult thing.
Educationist Nilesh Nimkar says, "Schools are closed all year round because of the corona.
Keeping children connected to education is a big challenge.
Over the past year, some of the learning through technology has continued during the lockdown.
Nilesh Nimkar says, "Education through technology was limited to urban students.
Nilesh Nimkar draws attention to one more thing.
Nilesh Nimkar says that there is a task force for health and education should be implemented in the field of education which is as important as health.
During Corona and Lockdown, students are going through a different mental state.
Industry: 'Employment should not be affected'
All businesses came to a standstill after the lockdown was imposed last year.
Entrepreneur and economist Jayaraj Salgaonkar pointed out this issue.
Speaking to BBC Marathi, Jayaraj Salgaonkar explained his point in more detail.
He said, "Last time the lockdown was imposed and the workers went back to their hometowns.
There is a fear of migration after the lockdown.
Opposition in Maharashtra is demanding a certain amount of help from the working class.
Salgaonkar says that the employment cycle should not be broken as it was in the past.
The workers should look at the industry and the industry should look at the working class with sympathy, because the situation is serious.
We also talked to economists about what needs to be learned from previous lockdowns to keep the economy afloat.
Economy: 'People's purchasing power must be maintained'
Over the past year, it has been noticed that the lockdown has hit the economy.
Amit Modak, an economist, says, "The most important thing is that people should not run out of purchasing power.
Going further, Amit Modak says, "The government should not make misleading announcements.
If some efforts are made at the government level, the economy can recover.
If the responsibility of the workers is left to the owner of an industry, the owner himself is more afraid of being fired from the industry, he says.
Moreover, "the government should not be unstable about lockdown decisions.

Corona: 'Apart from owning a house, it has been difficult to meet household expenses since last year'
I was working for a jewelery company in Andheri MIDC.
Amit Hatankar is responsible for the entire family including parents, wife and five-year-old daughter.
Shubhangi Parab (name changed) from Thane, Mumbai, says, "We both work as husband and wife.
Over the past year, the budgets of the economically weaker sections as well as the working middle class families have collapsed.
Due to the curfew in the state, it has also hit businesses.
How to share household expenses?
There is not enough money for home loan installment, daughter's school fees, house maintenance, electricity bill, groceries.
Tried a lot for the job in the last two months but Corona says the job opportunities are extremely low in the health crisis.
Amit demanded that the government should also announce help for the working class.
This financial crisis has not only hit one person but hundreds of thousands of working men and women are facing it now.
Shubhangi Parab (name changed) says that the company's production was shut down for a few months in last year's lockdown.
Everything was fine again.
Debt weeks, house rent, house expenses are all stressful to buy.
Kaustubh Upadhyay from Mumbai has a tourism business.
He also suffered so much in the last year that he had to close his office in Dadar.

'A quarter of a crore Indians out of the middle class?'
According to a report by Business Standard , about 1.5 crore Indians have left the middle class due to financial difficulties caused by the corona virus outbreak.
The number of middle-class Indians, or those earning10 to 20 20 a day (Rs 750 to Rs 1,500) a day, would have dropped by about a quarter to three-and-a-half crore if the Corona crisis had not occurred, according to the Pew Research Center.
Citing the World Bank's economic growth forecast, the PEW Research Center said, "The recession in Covid-19 has further reduced the middle class in India."
What do economists say?
When the middle class economy collapses, it has a big impact on the markets and consequently on the government coffers.
For example, suppose a family buys a packet of biscuits.
Employment is generated from the purchasing power of the middle class.
Speaking to BBC Marathi, he said, "In a country like ours, 80 per cent of the unorganized working class suffers the most.
He adds, "All middle-class financial planning depends on salary growth.
It will take the lower middle class at least ten years to get the economic train back on track.
The reduction in spending by the middle class, as well as the non-purchase of consumer goods or luxury goods, will reduce economic activity, but will affect not only GDP but the entire way of life, says Dr. Welingkar, a professor of economics at the Institute of Management.
He says, "Maharashtra accounts for 13-14 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP).
The highest production in the state is from Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, Aurangabad districts.
The financial year 2022-23 will be very important for the country including Maharashtra, predicted Dr. Chandrahas Deshpande.
What can you do financially in the current situation?
Economist Abhay Tilak says that in today's exceptional and challenging situation, you can work on some basics or keep them in mind:
The current situation is not volatile but uncertain.
In such a situation, try to maintain the employment.
While working from home, do what you can to increase your employability while sitting at home.
Try to do only what is extremely mandatory.
Avoid taking any big risks when it comes to money.
Pandharpur-Mangalvedha elections: Political leaders dumb in 'watermelon-melon-champa' even during Corona
All over India, including Maharashtra, the second wave of corona is currently showing how critical the health system is.
Although the rules are not applicable in this Pandharpur constituency for the elections, all the rules of the fight against Corona are being trampled on due to the campaign.
What does the level of publicity indicate?
Maharashtra has been hit the hardest by the corona across the country.
Leaders and political activists are wondering why the cause of death of Bharat Bhalke, a local representative who died due to corona, has been forgotten in a few months.
Even in this situation, the leaders seem to be emphasizing each other's grievances and personal criticisms.
Looking at the campaign for this election, one may wonder exactly what issues political leaders value.
Jayant Patil had arrived in Pandharpur to fill the application of Bhagirath Bhalke (March 30)
Criticizing Chandrakant Patil, Ajit Pawar said , "Chandrakant Patil has never set up any institution, has not run any bank or factory, has not run any development society or labor society.

He said, "If there is a wedding near the campaign, only 50 people are allowed there.
Sanjay Pathak also expressed concern over the post-poll situation.
Campaign blasts but government neglect
On April 8 and 9, Ajit Pawar held large rallies in Pandharpur and Mangalvedha.

The coronary movement is hampered by the corona
Confusion in the medical field; Some medical colleges still refuse

Corona: 6 important things in Narendra Modi's speech
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has appealed to all states that lockdown should be the last resort.
He told the state governments of the country that lockdown should be considered as a last resort, as lockdown causes huge financial losses.
In his speech, Narendra Modi gave some suggestions to the six constituents.
1) 'Keep lockdown last option'
Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed all the states and advised them to keep lockdown as a last resort.
Modi said, "We are all working to save lives.
Also, I urge the state administrations to try to maintain the trust of the workers, tell them to stay where they are.
In today's situation, we want to save the country from lockdown.
2) 'Measures to increase oxygen supply launched'
Whether it is the Kejriwal government in Delhi or the Thackeray government in Maharashtra, they seem to be constantly talking about oxygen supply.
Measures are being taken at various levels to increase oxygen production and supply, Modi said.
3) Modi's assurance about speedy vaccination
Narendra Modi addressed the people about vaccination and tried to reassure them.
Modi said, "Yesterday we took a decision on vaccination.
Now, half of the vaccine that will be made in India will go directly to the states and hospitals, Modi said.
4) 'Youth, help the needy by forming committees'
Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an appeal to the youth of the country.
Modi said, "I especially urge my childhood friends to create an atmosphere in the house where people do not go out without work.
Young people, form small committees in your society, mohalla, apartment and help people to follow the rules of corona.
5) What did Modi say to the media?
Narendra Modi has also made an important appeal to the media.
Modi said, "The media is requested to warn the people.
6) 'You are laborers, stay there'
Narendra Modi has appealed to the workers of various cities to take note of the migration that took place during the Corona period last year.
The workers should stay in the same city as you are.
Also, "Vaccination will take place in the city where you are, and as a result, the work of their workers will not stop," Modi said.
Corona: Will there be enough vaccines available to vaccinate everyone over the age of 18?
The Government of India has announced its decision to vaccinate all persons above the age of 18 years.
On the one hand, when there is a shortage of vaccines in many states, including Maharashtra, the important question is whether there will be such a large number of vaccines available to everyone above the age of 18 years.
We will review the question of how it is possible that so many vaccines will be available.
What is the status of vaccination in Maharashtra so far?
According to the Government of India, 12 crore 71 lakh 29 thousand 113 people have been vaccinated across India till 7 am on April 20.
According to Maharashtra statistics, the first dose of Corona vaccine was given to 1 crore 9 lakh 59 thousand 587 people in the state till April 19, while the second dose of the vaccine was given to 13 lakh 14 thousand 386 people.
We have to keep in mind that this figure is from January 16, the beginning of vaccination in India.
Meanwhile, there was a shortage of vaccines and political allegations were leveled.
However, in reality, vaccination was stopped at many centers in Maharashtra.
So is it possible to vaccinate all people above 18 years of age in Maharashtra, and is it possible to supply so many vaccines to Maharashtra?
'This is possible with non-political planning'
Treasurer of the World Medical Association and former National President of the Indian Medical Association, Dr. Ravi Wankhedkar said, "Accelerating vaccination in Maharashtra is very important today because Maharashtra has become a hotspot in the country."
Speaking on whether we should be ready to vaccinate all people over the age of 18 from May 1, Dr. Ravi Wankhedkar said, "Such a large scale vaccination is easily possible if the central government and the state government stop politicizing the vaccine and if the administration moves without delay."
If the central government says it has announced this, then the central government should supply the same to Maharashtra or any other state.
He also said, "Even if 40 per cent people in Maharashtra are vaccinated, we will overcome 90 per cent corona."
Expressed by Wankhedkar.
What do the members of the Maharashtra government's task force think?
At the same time, BBC Marathi quoted a member of the Maharashtra government's Covid Task Force and Director of Critical Care at Fortis Hospital, Dr. Interacted with Rahul Pandit.
Dr. Rahul Pandit said, "The central government has taken a very important step.
I don't think we will face any problems as the central government has allowed vaccines to be taken directly from the manufacturers, he said, Rahul Pandit said.
However, "we have to plan well for this third phase of vaccination campaign, no doubt about it.
How will the vaccine be distributed?
Vaccine producers should give 50 per cent stock of the vaccine to the Center and 50 per cent to the state governments and the open market, the Center said.
Announcing the policy, the government said the stock could be given to the state governments and the open market at the price fixed by the producers.
Vaccine manufacturers will have to announce the price before May 1 to sell 50 per cent of the product to the state government and the open market.
After that, private hospitals will be allowed to decide how much to charge for the vaccine.
The 50 per cent vaccines that go to the central government will be distributed by the center to various states and union territories.
Those who take the first dose in the early stages of the campaign and take the second will be given priority during this vaccination.
Are there enough vaccines available?
In the first week of April, various vaccination centers across the state had to be closed due to depletion of vaccines in Maharashtra.
According to The Wire , 24 lakh doses of the vaccines produced in India, Kovishield and Kovacin, are produced daily.
Along with domestic demand, India is also committed to the Covax group.
But in the meantime, US restrictions on the export of raw materials for vaccines have affected vaccine production around the world.
Adar Poonawala of the Serum Institute had demanded this a few days ago by tweeting to US President Joe Biden.
We are all together in the fight against this virus, and that is why we are calling for the lifting of restrictions on raw material exports on behalf of vaccine manufacturers outside the United States, Poonawala said in the tweet.
Efforts are being made to bring other international vaccines to India along with the vaccines produced in the country.
When will the international vaccine arrive in India?
The Russian-made Sputnik-V vaccine has been approved by the Government of India for emergency use.
Dr. India. Sputnik has an agreement with Reddy's Laboratory for 10 crore doses of the vaccine. Russia had said it would hand over the Reddy's lab.
The vaccine will be available in India after May, said Dr. Vinod Paul had said.
There was talk of the government considering allowing vaccines approved by drug regulators in other countries after testing, but no other vaccines have been approved yet.
Johnson & Johnson has sought permission to conduct tests in India for the third phase of their Johnson single-dose vaccine.
Pfizer had applied to the Indian government for emergency recognition, but later withdrew.
There is still no clarity about the modern vaccine.
A central official told Reuters that the Indian government was ready to waive the 10 per cent import duty on international vaccines to make them available in India.

Little did we know that coronary heart disease would spread so rapidly.
We also told the doctor, don't follow Remedesivir.
People need to pay attention to oxygen measurement, fever, cold, cough.
Question 6 - on the doctor to the patient remadesivira B'Av is thrown?
Dr. Shashank Joshi- Patients put a lot of pressure on doctors.
Do not experiment with laboratory drugs on your patient.
Question 7 - Who should give Remedesivir?
Dr. Shashank Joshi: Various states have directed the Food and Drug Administration and doctors to dispense medicine.
Let the doctor decide which patient to take Remedacivir.
Question 8 - What came next in Remedesivir's test?
Dr. Shashank Joshi: The World Health Organization (WHO) had examined Remedesivir.
No research from around the world has shown that remedivir saves lives.
Question 9 - Will the wave of covid come again?
Dr. Shashank Joshi- People should be careful.
The second, third, fourth wave will continue to come.
The second wave is affecting young people and children.
Corona vaccine: Where do people over the age of 18 register to get the vaccine?
In view of the increasing prevalence of corona in India, vaccination of all persons above the age of 18 years will be started from May 1, 2021.
Today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a review meeting on Corona.
Vaccination for Covid 19 was started in India from January 16 and from March 1, citizens above 60 years of age and citizens above 45 years of age with congenital heart disease were being vaccinated.
Vaccines are also available at private hospitals depending on availability.
So let's see, what do people over the age of 18 have to do to get vaccinated, where do they have to register?
The Government of India has developed a digital platform called Co-WIN for the vaccination campaign.
What is the Co-WIN app?
Covin (Co-WIN) is a digital platform for the Covid 19 vaccination campaign.
The Covin (Co-WIN) app is available for download in the App Store.
How to register for vaccine?
Registration for vaccination is mandatory on Covin's website or from the Covin app.
After opening the website, scroll down and you will see the option 'Find Your Nearest Vaccination Center'.
Then the Register for Vaccination window appears.
You will then see the account details.
Users can give the date of vaccination only on this account details page.
You can then fill in the complete information for the vaccination center as well.
Clicking on the nearest center will tell you the time available.
You will see a registered message on the screen.
What are the 5 modules on the Covin app and what are they for?
The Covin (Co-WIN) app will have five modules - Management, Registration, Vaccination, Acknowledgment and Information.
People can register for vaccination through the registration module.
It will be an 'Administrator' module for vaccinating officers.
The information provided by the registrant can be verified by the vaccination module in the app and the status of the person can also be updated after vaccination.
QR code certificates will be generated through the 'Beneficiary Acknowledgment Module' for acknowledgment and an SMS will be sent to the person after vaccination.
With the help of 'Report' module, information on vaccination sessions - how many sessions were given, how many people were vaccinated and who did not come - can be reported to the authorities.
What documents are required for registration on Covin (Co-WIN) app?
You will need to have photo ID to register.
These documents can be used -
Voter ID card
Aadhaar card
Driving license
PAN card
MGNREGA employment card
Bank or post office passbook
Passbook
Pension documents
The same identity card used during registration has to be shown while going for vaccination.
How will the Covin app work?
This is a cloud based app designed for planning, implementation and monitoring of the vaccination campaign for Covid 19.
After registering through this app for vaccination, the registrant will be provided the date, time and details of the vaccination center via SMS.
Since each person will have to take two doses of the vaccine, the app will also tell you when you want to come back after taking the first dose and take the second dose.
After taking both doses of the vaccine, the person will be given a certificate in the form of a QR code.
Corona Maharashtra: Grocery stores in the state will be open from 7.00 am to 11.00 am
A meeting chaired by the Deputy Chief Minister also decided to limit the time of grocery shops from 7 am to 11 am as people are going out all day in the name of grocery shopping despite the restrictions.
Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said that this decision had to be taken as many people in the state do not follow the rules of corona.
A meeting was held under the chairmanship of Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar in his ministry room to review the issues of enhancing health facilities in hospitals in the state, maintaining oxygen supply, overcoming the problems of doctors and health workers.
The meeting was attended by Health Minister Rajesh Tope, Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde (via VC), Medical Education Minister Amit Deshmukh (via VC), Food and Drug Administration Minister Dr. Rajendra Shingane and other senior officers of the concerned departments were present.
Emphasis on oxygen generation projects
Given the growing number of corona patients and the growing demand for oxygen, oxygen generating plants should be set up in more and more hospitals immediately.
Paper, steel, petroleum, fertilizer companies, refinery industries should try to get more oxygen.
They should be traced and repaired immediately.
During the meeting, the Deputy Chief Minister reviewed the availability of beds, oxygen and remedicavir medicine in the hospitals in the state.
Oxygen-generating projects have been set up at hospitals in Kolhapur and Thane districts.
Mumbai Municipal Corporation has also started proceedings regarding such projects.
Demand to the Center for Remedesivir
Efforts are underway at the battle level to make remedesivir injection available in the state.
The meeting also expressed confidence that the state would soon have adequate stock of remedicivir.
Maharashtra Lockdown: Is the state moving towards a strict lockdown?
The administration is making strenuous efforts to stem the second wave of corona in the state.
For the last two months, there have been repeated warnings of lockdown in the state.
Accordingly, a curfew has been imposed in the state from 8 pm on April 14 to 7 am on May 1.
Essential services will be available from 7 am to 8 pm, rickshaws, trains, airlines and public transport.
You can read the entire manual here .
However, despite these restrictions, the situation in the state has not changed.
Even after the lockdown, there is still talk of congestion on the roads, increasing number of patients, lack of beds, medicines, lack of oxygen.
Against this backdrop, cabinet ministers are now warning of a lockdown again.
Considering all these things, the question has arisen as to whether Maharashtra is heading towards a severe lockdown.
' Lock in front, turn on '
One of the reasons behind the complete lockdown by the ruling political leaders as well as the authorities is the crowds on the streets.
Although Chief Minister Thackeray has imposed restrictions, the congestion on the roads does not seem to be decreasing.
People are leaving their homes for reasons like essential services, parcel meals, medicines, vegetables.
Whether the police and the administration are failing to stop the mob is also being debated on the other side.
Taking advantage of this, Gallogalli citizens can be seen standing in a crowd, sitting on benches.
Yogin Gurjar, a social activist and former president of the All India Consumer Consumers Federation, said that the reason behind this situation was the loophole given by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.
According to Gurjar, "Lockdown in the state has become a joke at present.
Gurjar feels that citizens are equally responsible for this situation.
People do not avoid crowding.
... then a strict lockdown will have to be imposed - Ajit Pawar
Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Friday (April 16) warned that if the people do not cooperate, a tough lockdown will have to be taken as in the past.
Pawar was speaking at a corona status review meeting with the district administration in Pune.
Appealing to the citizens to cooperate with the administration and abide by the rules, Ajit Pawar said, "More people are being affected by the second wave of corona than the first wave.
Not only Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar but also other leaders in the cabinet were seen giving such hints.
Food and Civil Supplies Minister and Nashik Guardian Minister Chhagan Bhujbal has said that he is not insisting on strict restrictions but about complete lockdown.
Traders have demanded a complete lockdown in Nashik.
Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar also demanded a complete lockdown.
Speaking to ANI, she said, "Most of the citizens seem to be following the lockdown.
Rising number of patients in Maharashtra
On the other hand, the number of corona patients in the state is not declining.
Over 60,000 coronavirus patients are being diagnosed every day in the state in the last few days.
At present there are 6 lakh 47 thousand 933 active corona patients in the state.
Not only this, it is also worth noting that there are 35 lakh 72 thousand 584 citizens who are in the home quarantine at present, who have come in contact with various patients and traveled, who are feeling the symptoms, who are not feeling them.
Lack of beds, medicines , oxygen , ventilators
On the one hand, complaints of non-availability of beds, medicines and oxygen have become commonplace as the number of patients has increased.
There are also complaints that the growing number of patients is putting a strain on health facilities.
On April 10, there was no ventilator left in Pune, Nagpur, Mumbai.
According to the latest information, there are only 9 ventilators left in Pune at present.
It is said that there is a huge shortage of oxygen in Nashik at present.
Against this backdrop, the number of beds should be increased as the number of patients is increasing in the state.
But this does not mean that the health system in the state has collapsed, explained Ajit Pawar.
He said, "The health system has been working harder than last year.
Meanwhile, the ruling party and the opposition have come face to face over the shortage of Remedesivir drugs, which has led to a tug-of-war.
Local restrictions began to be imposed, fueling essential services
Looking at all of the above, we can see that the Corona situation in the state is serious.
Disaster Management Minister Vijay Vadettiwar had also commented on the growing congestion on the roads.
Vadettivar had said that the state government had decided that fuel would be available only to the essential service personnel to stop the citizens from roaming on the roads without any reason.
In addition, some restrictions are being raised at the local level.
In addition, the travel time for essential services in Solapur has been reduced to just six weeks.
Citizens can only go to Solapur from 7 am to 1 pm to buy vegetables.
Considering all these developments, the restrictions in the state are likely to be even stricter.
Maharashtra Lockdown: What are the new government regulations for railways?
Under the state government's 'Break the Chain' initiative, new regulations have now been announced for rail travel.
Accordingly, those coming to Maharashtra from Kerala, Goa, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Delhi and Uttarakhand will have to show a negative report of the corona.
These six states have been declared corona sensitive.
The complete regulations issued by the Government of Maharashtra are as follows -
Passengers are required to wear a mask throughout the journey.
Passengers will be subjected to thermal testing while traveling at the train station.
It is important to follow the rules of social distance while getting in and out of the car.
Passengers are expected to arrive at the station early to avoid congestion for thermal scanning, as well as give passengers time to carry out all these procedures.
Train passengers are required to carry a mobile ticket or e-ticket so that they can be traced by mobile number.
RT-PCR testing of passengers coming from sensitive places is required.
It has been made mandatory to provide the information of the passengers coming to Maharashtra from sensitive places to the Disaster Management Authority of the district where the passengers are going.
No passenger coming from such a sensitive place can travel in Maharashtra without a reserved ticket.
Corona rules need to be announced at all railway stations.
After landing at the desired location, the passengers will be released after seeing the RT-PCR test report.
The home quarantine stamp will also be stamped on the hands of the passengers.
If positive test or thermal screening shows symptoms of corona, such passengers will be moved to Covid Center.
Many passengers may not have RT-PCR reports, in which case the railways should provide rapid antigen test facility, the rules said.

There are complaints that this drug is being black marketed.
Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis was the first to reach the Vile Parle police station after receiving information that Dokania had been arrested.
There was a verbal clash between the BJP leader and the police.
Action with political revenge:
We went to the police only after realizing that the Fadnavis police had arrested the owner of Brooke Pharma from his house.
The BJP leaders had approached the exporters in Daman and requested them to release the remaining stocks for Maharashtra due to the export ban.
Obtained the necessary legal permissions from the Food and Drug Administration of the Central and State Governments.

Police then carried out the operation at night.
Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis alleged that the action was taken out of revenge for political motives.
Why Fadnavis is so fond of: Nawab Malik
Why Rajesh Dokania of Brooke Pharma was summoned for questioning? T
He also asked why Fadnavis was so fond of this company.
Some companies have stocks available to us after banning the export of Remedesivir.
They are asking the state government to allow us to sell.
Rajesh Dokania, owner of Brooke Pharma, had personally met Food and Drugs Minister Rajendra Shingane along with Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council Praveen Darekar.
The export companies have stocks of drugs, on the basis of which information was being gathered by calling Dokania.
Rajesh Dokania has been questioned and released.
You tweet and say that we are going to get a stock of 50,000 remedivir injections.
But when the government asks, these professionals do not give.
So what is the politics behind this? The BJP should make this clear, Malik said.

Corona: Are hospitals in Maharashtra becoming a death trap?
A fire at Vijay Vallabh Hospital in Virar killed 13 covid patients. 
While struggling to survive in the ICU, these patients were attacked by time.
This is not the first case of Kovid-19 or general hospital fire in Maharashtra.
More than 45 patients have lost their lives in hospital fires in the past few months.
An inquiry is ordered by the government following the hospital fire. 
Action is taken after the inquiry report.
But concrete measures do not seem to be happening.
So hospitals in Maharashtra are becoming a death trap? This important question reappears.
Incidents of hospital fires
April 23, 2021 - Thirteen patients die in a fire at Vijay Vallabh Hospital in Virar. 
The primary cause of the fire was said to be an explosion caused by a short circuit in the AC unit.
April 10, 2021 - A fire broke out at Covid Hospital in Wadi area of ​​Nagpur. 
4 patients died. 
A fire broke out in the AC unit in the ICU.
March 26, 2021 - A fire at Sunrise Covid Hospital in Bhandup kills 11 Covid patients. 
The primary cause of the fire was a short circuit.
October 2020 - Apex Covid Hospital in Mulund catches fire. 
1 patient died. 
It was reported that the fire started due to excessive heat on the generator.
January 2021 - A fire broke out in the neonatal ward of Bhandara District Hospital.
It killed 10 newborns.
The investigation revealed that the radiant spark in the radial thermal control panel had started.
What caused the fire in the hospital?
The main reasons for the firefight are negligence of the hospital administration, delay in checking the fire safety in the hospital by the government agencies.
Pratap Karguppikar, former Chief of Mumbai Fire Brigade, explains the main reasons for the fire in the hospital -
Fire retardant material is not used in the Covid Center or in the hospital
The air in the AC room should be completely changed at least 20 times per hour. I
f there is too much oxygen in the room, there is a possibility of fire
Covid uses sanitizers to wash hands in the hospital. 
The flammable gas in it stays in the air.
If the AC is kept on continuously, the part in it is likely to overheat and explode.
If the wiring is defective, there is a risk of fire.
All these things are not taken care of in the name of emergency management.
Maintenance and repair are neglected. 
The combination of oxygen and flammable substances is very dangerous," added Pratap Karguppikar.
Prashant Thackeray, who lives in Palghar, has installed AC system in many hospitals. 
He says, "The AC needs to be maintained and repaired in a timely manner.
If the wiring, cabling breaks down, there is a possibility of a short circuit."
Can an AC explode?
The primary cause of the fire in the hospital in the last few days is the explosion in the AC unit.
Talking about it, Pratap Karguppikar says, "The AC machine needs to rest after eight hours.
It actually needs two machines. 
If the AC is on continuously, it will get very hot.
The part in the AC will get hot. 
There is a possibility of a small explosion."
BJP leader Kirit Somaiya said, "No hospital in the state has undergone fire safety audit. 
This audit needs to be done in a scientific manner.
Bhandup hospital did not have fire safety.
The government should audit all covid centers."

The National Disaster Management Authority has issued fire safety instructions to hospitals across the country in 2016 -
The hospital wall and floor should be fireproof
In case of fire, automatic fire protection system should be activated
Fire alarm system, fire extinguishing system
There should be a duct or shaft to secure the electrical wiring
The hospital should practice once a year how to get patients out of the ICU and ward in an emergency
Study of ICU management in case of emergency
AC inspection panels and doors should be fireproof.
Many guidelines like these have been given regarding the fire safety of the hospital.
The main reason for negligence?
Paper horses are danced by the government after a hospital fire incident.
After preparing the report, action was taken against two or four people. 
But no concrete measures are being taken.
It is the job of Wireman and the engineers to check whether there is a fire audit in the hospital, whether the fire protection equipment is proper, whether there is a short circuit.
They should be monitored by senior officers, but this is ignored," says Mahesh Jhagde, a former chartered accountant.
What is the situation in Mumbai?
After the hospital fire, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had ordered fire audits of all hospitals in the state.
The issue of lack of fire safety in the hospital was raised in the March budget session. 
Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde had admitted in the legislature that fire safety flaws were found in 701 hospitals in Mumbai.
State Government Information -
Mumbai Municipal Corporation conducted fire safety audit of 1324 private and government hospitals
663 Errors in fire safety measures in private hospitals. 
Notices were issued to these hospitals
Errors were found in 38 government and municipal hospitals
A fire audit of Thane hospitals was conducted on the background of the accident at Bhandara District Hospital. 
The fire department inspected 347 hospitals in Thane.
Notices have been sent to 168 hospitals in the city.
According to information provided by the government to the legislature, faulty electrical systems are the main cause of fires in most cases.
In April 2019, the Bombay High Court had ordered the sealing of all hospitals in Mumbai and Thane which were not allowed by the fire department.
Mumbai Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had in April ordered a fire safety audit of all hospitals.
Faulty wiring is the leading cause of fire
In 2018, the then Minister of State for Urban Development Ranjit Patil had informed the Legislative Council that 69 per cent of fires in Mumbai were due to faulty wiring.
Between 2008 and 2018, there were more than 49,000 fires in Mumbai. 
In more than 33,000 cases, the government said fires were caused by short circuits.
Corona Virus: What is Proning? Why did the Ministry of Health advise 'this' to coronaries?
In the second wave of corona, the situation is getting worse day by day. 
A large number of Kovid-19 patients need oxygen. 
But severe oxygen shortages across the country have claimed the lives of many patients.
Many hospitals in the country had said that they had only a few hours of oxygen left.
Delhi's Max Hospital had to go to court for oxygen supply.
The Union Ministry of Health has come up with some simple methods of pronation for patients who have difficulty breathing. 
This is called 'Pronation for Self Care' by the Ministry of Health.
Pronying can help patients with covid-19 to improve their oxygen levels
What is 'Proning'?
Proning is the process of taking a deep breath while lying on your stomach properly.
This helps to compensate for the lack of oxygen in the body, according to guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
The guidelines say it is very beneficial for covid patients who are in isolation at home and have difficulty breathing or have low oxygen levels.
These methods should be used if the patient is having difficulty breathing or if the oxygen level in his body is less than 94, the instructions said.
While in home isolation, oxygen level, blood pressure, blood sugar level and body temperature should be constantly monitored.
Properly covered, it will withstand a great deal of adverse conditions.
This method, which improves respiratory function and oxygen levels, has been medically approved.
This condition is completely safe and can be controlled by lowering the level of oxygen in the blood.
Good results have also been seen in patients admitted to the ICU.
This procedure can be effective if you do not have a ventilator.
Emphasis on sleeping on the stomach
It is recommended to sleep on the stomach during pronation. 
It has been suggested to use a pillow for this. 
One pillow under the neck, one or two pillows should be taken from the chest to the thighs and two more pillows should be placed on the feet.
A total of 4-5 pillows will thus be needed to sleep on the stomach.
And the person can decide how thick the pillow should be.
It also tells you how to change your position every now and then
Do not stay in the same position for more than 30 minutes and keep changing your position.
When should Proning be done?
Proning should not be done if the patient is pregnant or if the patient has a heart condition.
Also, everyone should sleep in this way as long as they can sleep comfortably.
Do not sleep on your stomach immediately after eating.
During a 24 hour period you can do proning in different positions for 16 hours.
If you feel pain after sleeping in the same way, reduce the stress on that part of the body and sleep in a way that makes you feel better.
Corona Maharashtra: Can it be said that the situation in Mumbai-Pune has improved?
In the second wave of corona, the number of patients in Maharashtra started increasing rapidly. 
It showed cities like Mumbai-Pune setting new records in the number of patients every day.
This became clear from the daily statistics of the state government.
However, the statistics of these cities over the last few days have given a promising picture.
Since April 19, the number of patients recovering in Mumbai-Pune has been increasing compared to the new corona patients.
However, the question arises as to what is the reason behind this and if so, would it be fair to say that the situation in these cities has really improved.
To find the answer to this question, let's first look at the statistics of corona patients in these two cities.
What do the numbers say?
According to the statistics of Mumbai and Pune, since April 19, the number of patients recovering in these cities has increased as compared to the number of new patients.
As many as 7,381 new corona patients were found in the city on April 19 and 8,583 patients were cured, according to Mumbai Municipal Corporation data.
On April 22, 7,410 new patients were found in Mumbai, while the number of cured was 8,090.
This means that the number of patients recovering in Mumbai has increased compared to the number of new patients.
According to the Pune Municipal Corporation, 4,587 new corona patients were found in Pune on April 19, while 6,473 patients were cured.
On April 22, 4,539 new patients were found in Pune, while 4,851 patients were cured.
This means that the number of cured patients is also increasing in Pune city.
The number of infected patients is stable
The number of patients being infected daily in Mumbai had gone up to 10,000 in the medium term, while in Pune it was over 6,000. 
Now the situation is changing and the number of new patients is steadily increasing.
State Health Survey Officer Dr. Speaking on the occasion, Pradip Awate said, "Currently, the number of infected patients is stable.
About 80 to 85 percent of the 100 victims have mild symptoms. 
Many people get it at home. 
Therefore, the rate of recovery is increasing rapidly and the severity of the infection is mild.
Former state president of the Indian Medical Association, Dr. According to Avinash Bhondwe, "If the number of new patients continues to rise next week, the situation is under control.
"Currently, the growing number of patients is slowly stabilizing. 
Only after we see where this graph is heading in the next three weeks can we determine whether the infection is being controlled," he says.
Do restrictions reduce morbidity?
The Maharashtra government has announced a lockdown in the state to prevent corona. 
This has led to strict restrictions in the state at present.
Asked whether the state government's restrictions were reducing the number of patients, Bhondwe said, "The new government is benefiting from the restrictions imposed from April 14 onwards.
The reduction in congestion in the streets and markets has definitely reduced the incidence of infection.
In order to reduce the number of new coronaviruses and increase the number of recoveries, these restrictions should be continued for another fortnight.
So, in the first 15 days of this wave of corona, the number of healings is low, then the number of healings gradually increases. 
This cycle continues later.
It cannot be said that the effect of the current restrictions is seen in the number of people who are recovering, "said Awate.
It will take another three to four weeks for the growing number of corona patients to come under control.
When people get beds and oxygen easily, it can be said that the infection is under control, '' Awate thinks.
Corona virus: Did corona grow due to election campaigns in India? - Reality check
The number of corona virus infections in India is increasing rapidly.
The growing number of patients is putting a huge strain on the country's healthcare system.
Meanwhile, elections are underway in four Indian states. 
Therefore, the reason behind this situation in India is being pointed out to the election campaign rallies.
But the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has denied the allegations.
There is no connection between the growing number of patients in the country and election campaigns or religious programs, explained BJP leader Dr. Vijay Chauthaiwale has given.
The number of patients has increased since February
The number of corona virus cases in India has been declining since mid-September 2020. 
But by the end of February, the numbers had picked up again.
The morbidity graph for the month of March is growing at a tremendous pace. 
As a result, numbers in the second wave appear to be growing twice as fast as in the first wave of the corona. 
 The previous high of corona patients was also broken this time.
Meanwhile, elections are being held in the four Union Territories of West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry in India. 
Campaign rallies of political parties have been taking place here since the beginning of March. 
Voting will take place in March and April.
Did Corona grow because of the campaign?
Even during the Corona period, large crowds were seen at the rallies of political parties.
In the meanwhile, the social distance was completely blown away.
Besides, there were no masks on people's faces.
None of the leaders, candidates or their supporters were seen following the Corona restraint rules.
Meanwhile, the Election Commission of India has sent a notice to West Bengal in this regard. 
The commission has banned campaign rallies in West Bengal since April 22 due to non-compliance by political leaders.
On the other hand, the number of patients in West Bengal has been increasing rapidly since March.
You can see the rising graph of the number of patients.
The situation is similar in other states with more or less differences.
However, the exact number of corona outbreaks could not be ascertained.
But it is not only in these four states that the number of patients is increasing.
The period also saw a rapid increase in the number of corona patients in other states in the country.
Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka are experiencing rapid growth of corona. 
 There are no elections in these states.
However, the number of patients here is high.
Therefore, it cannot be said directly that elections alone increase corona.
We don't even have concrete evidence to say so.
High risk in confined spaces
Experts say that the risk of infection is lower when people gather in the open than in a closed place.
Warwick Medical School Pvt. According to Lawrence Young, the virus can become inactive rapidly in the open.
However, the risk of infection is higher if such a large crowd gathers in one place. 
People stand close to each other in crowded places for a long time, they do not observe social distance, at such times the infection can spread, said Prof. Young said.
University of Bristol's Pvt. Jonathan Reid says, "There is a risk of standing nearby. 
Especially if someone is standing in front of or around you at a distance of 1 meter, the risk of infection is higher.
If a person shouts loudly in such a situation, the chances of infection are also higher through the snow that comes out of the mouth.
The reason for the increase is the new variant?
Scientists are studying whether there is another variant of corona after the second wave of corona in India.
According to experts, even if there is such a possibility, there is no strong evidence for it.
Due to lack of proper statistics, the Indian Department of Public Health has not yet included the Indian variant of the Corona in its 'Variant of Concern' list. 
The term is used in the UK for variants of Brazil and South Africa.
Apart from that, Kumbh Mela was also organized in North India in the month of March. 
 Millions of devotees from all over the country gather here . 
Here, too, it is said, corona prevention rules have not been properly followed.
Between April 10 and 14, more than 1,600 coronary artery disease cases were detected during the Kumbh Mela.
Corona virus: 20 patients die due to lack of oxygen, oxygen tanker admitted
Oxygen deficiency has claimed the lives of 20 patients at the Jaipur Golden Hospital in Delhi.
The Jaipur Golden Hospital in Rohini area of ​​Delhi had said in the morning that it had only half an hour's supply of oxygen left.
The oxygen tanker was admitted to the hospital at 12.30 pm.
The hospital has 200 patients, 80 of whom are on oxygen support and 35 in the ICU.
Last night, 20 critically ill patients died due to lack of oxygen, PTI reported.
We are waiting for the oxygen supply and 215 patients of Kovid 19 are in dire need of it," said the hospital's medical director.
Most of the 20 people who died were Kovid-19 patients and were admitted to the hospital's critical care unit, the Hindustan Times quoted hospital officials as saying.
As the hospital ran out of oxygen, the oxygen pressure dropped and all these patients died.
The hospital's medical director, Deep Baluja, said, "We lost all the patients who were being supplied with high pressure oxygen in the critical care unit.
We ran out of liquid oxygen by 10 pm on Friday.
According to the Hindustan Times, the hospital was supposed to receive oxygen for them by 5.30 pm on Friday, but the stock did not reach the hospital by midnight.
Even after the death of 20 patients, the hospital has received only 40 per cent of the oxygen it needs.
Dr. "We are facing a crisis once again.
200 lives are in danger. 
 We saved a lot of lives last night but we may not be able to do that today.
The oxygen we kept as backup is now gone," Baluja said.
Give oxygen to Delhi, Kejriwal's letter to all Chief Ministers
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has written a letter to all Indian chief ministers demanding oxygen.
Kejriwal gave this information through a tweet.
The central government is helping us, said Arvind Kejriwal.
There are reports of oxygen shortages in many hospitals in Delhi. 
In such a situation, Kejriwal has made this demand.
It will be important to see which state responds to this letter.
Corona virus: AIIMS and ICMR's new guidelines for treatment of Kovid 19 elderly patients
AIIMS, ICMR, Covid 19 Task Force and Joint Monitoring Group have announced new procedures for the treatment of Covid 19 elderly patients.
These patients are categorized as Mild, Moderate and Severe and are given instructions on how to treat these patients.
New guidelines from AIIMS and ICMR
Elderly patients infected with the corona virus who do not have difficulty breathing will be considered a mild infection type.
Senior patients whose body oxygen level is between 90 and 93 percent while in the room will be considered in the moderate to moderate infection category.
Patients whose body oxygen level is less than 90 percent when they are in the room will be considered to have a serious infection.
Patients with a mild infection are advised to stay in home isolation, observe social distance, and consult a doctor.
Patients with moderate infection are advised to be admitted to the ward where oxygen is available. 
If the patient is in critical condition, CT scan and X-ray of the chest are recommended.
Patients with severe infections are advised to be admitted to the ICU. 
Respiratory support should be given according to their condition.
Patients of moderate and severe type should be discharged from the hospital as per the criteria for discharge after their health improves.
People over the age of 60, with heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, bladder, lung or liver disorders, have a higher risk of contracting the corona virus. 
Mortality has also been found to be higher in such patients.
The guidelines state that remedesivir should be used only for moderate to severe patients who do not need oxygen support.
Remedacivir, which is in home isolation and does not require oxygen, should not be given.
Tosilizumab is recommended for critically ill patients who have been admitted to the ICU for 24 to 48 hours and whose condition is deteriorating.
Corona: 'Oxygen Express' arrives in Nashik
After unloading 3 tankers at Nagpur on Friday night, Oxygen Express has now reached Nashik.
Due to lack of oxygen in Maharashtra, it is planned to supply from abroad.
Railways have started supplying oxygen to the state and the train that went to fetch oxygen has returned to Maharashtra.
Three oxygen containers brought from Visakhapatnam were unloaded from Roll on Roll of (Roro) Oxygen Express at Nagpur on Friday (April 23) night.
After that this morning Oxygen Express has arrived in Nashik.
The first train of Roro Oxygen Express was sent from Kalamboli station in Mumbai.
The train went to Visakhapatnam with empty containers, which were filled with oxygen.
The train left Visakhapatnam on Thursday night.
7 oxygen tankers were placed on this train. 
Out of which 3 tankers have landed in Nagpur.
Railway officials had informed about this initiative while the train was leaving. 
Accordingly, 16 metric tons of oxygen will be brought from each compartment of this special train of seven coaches and this train will be given priority over the railways. 
The Railway Ministry plans to launch other such trains.
The 12 states in India that are experiencing shortage of oxygen for medical use are Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan.
On the one hand, there are states like Madhya Pradesh which do not have enough capacity to meet the demand for oxygen for medical use, while on the other hand, there is a growing demand for oxygen from the oxygen producing states of Gujarat, Karnataka and Rajasthan.

Corona Maharashtra: Color coding rule for vehicles in Mumbai repealed - Mumbai Police
Mumbai Police has withdrawn the decision of color coding for classification of vehicles traveling during lockdown in Mumbai.
During the lockdown, the Mumbai Police had asked to reduce the number of vehicles on the road and to affix red, green or yellow stickers on the vehicles in an attempt to classify them.
 Its implementation was also initiated.
But now this color classification has been discontinued.
However, Mumbai Police said that they will continue checking the vehicles.
Mumbai Police had started color coding to reduce the number of vehicles on the roads during the lockdown.
Red color for vehicles of medical staff, medical services
Green for vegetables, groceries, fruits and dairy carts
Yellow for essential service
The 6-inch round sticker was affixed to the front and rear windows of the vehicle.
The stickers were obtained from the police at some toll plazas and blockades.
The order was issued by Mumbai Police Commissioner Hemant Nagarale himself.
Doctors, ambulances and medical vehicles are getting stuck due to checkpoints at the toll plazas.
A color code policy is being introduced for this.
Emergency service people will have to affix stickers on the vehicles," Hemant Nagarale had said.
Police, corporations, journalists, doctors, some are taking advantage by putting up posters like this.
Therefore, the Mumbai Police is investigating whether the employees in the vehicles are working for essential services.
"We want to carry out the lockdown announced by the Maharashtra government in a good way," Hemant Nagarale had said.
On the other hand, Mumbai's Guardian Minister Aslam Sheikh said, "The vegetable market is not overcrowded.

Corona: What is a '6 minute walk test' to check lung health?
As the incidence of corona infection is increasing day by day in Maharashtra, the '6 minute walk test' is currently being discussed everywhere. 
We will learn about this.
Covid-19 is spreading like a tsunami across the country.
With more than 3 lakh patients found in a single day, haha: cars have been blown up across the country. 
The second wave of corona infections is affecting family-to-family. 
In everyone's mind, I was afraid that I would get a corona infection, or it would have happened.
If someone coughs or sneezes on the side, we immediately look at that person with suspicion. 
Trying to get away from that person. 
Many feel like I'm out of breath. 
No cough, but feeling restless.
There is a constant fear in my mind, I have not had a corona infection?
Has this ever happened to you? 
According to doctors, '6 minute walk test' is the simple answer to all your questions.
What is a 6 minute walk test?
The coronavirus attacks the lungs. 
Which obstructs breathing. 
Covid-19 infection reduces lung function, experts say.
According to the Maharashtra Health Department, "During the Covid-19 period, the simplest and easiest way to check whether the lungs are in good health or function is a '6 minute walk test' or a '6 minute walk test'."
The director of the intensive care unit of Fortis Hospital, Dr. Says Rahul Pandit, "The 6-minute walk test was developed to find out the tolerance of the heart and lungs after exercise.
The Maharashtra Health Department has issued a circular to inform the people about the 6 minute walk test.
According to the health department, '6 minute walk test' helps to know the hidden hypoxia in the blood.
o that the needy patients can be admitted to the hospital on time.
What is Happy Hypoxia?
According to experts, even if the oxygen level in the patient's body decreases, the patient looks normal.
he patient shows no signs of obstruction in breathing. 
In medical parlance this is called 'Happy Hypoxia'.
How to do 6 minute walk test?
According to the health department -
Before taking a 6 minute walk test, check the level of oxygen in the body with a Pulse Oximeter.
Then walk around the house with a clock or stopwatch for six minutes
Do not walk too fast or too slow.
After walking for six minutes, check the oxygen level in the blood again
Head of Physiotherapy Department of Nanavati Max Super Specialty Hospital, Dr. Ali Irani says, "Some people may get short of breath while doing this test. 
 Or stop if they need to. 
But, keep the clock on for six minutes. 
Once the shortness of breath is cured, you can start the test again.
You can also run with the help of a stick or a walker."
What to do after walk test?
According to experts, blood oxygen levels should be measured again after a home walk test.
The oxygen level should be compared before and after the test.
So that the difference in oxygen level is known.
"Blood pressure, oxygen levels and heart rate should be measured immediately after the test, one minute and five minutes apart.
It is important to note this to understand how long your recovery period is," he said. 
Irani goes on to say.
Who should do '6 minute walk test'?
According to a statement issued by the health department, people with fever, cold, cough or other symptoms of corona infection, as well as those in home isolation, should take a 6-minute walk test.
Dr. Ali Irani added, "Anyone can do this test.
There is no age limit.
This test can be done for yourself or for a family member."
While Dr. According to Pandit, "this test should be done within 5 to 12 days after the onset of symptoms."
Can patients with covidosis do this test?
Dr. "Patients with corona can take the test.
They are afraid of getting oxygen.
If they take the test, they will know the level of oxygen in the body and will be able to go to the hospital on time if needed," says Irani.
Doctors perform these tests while discharging coronary artery patients in the hospital.
What should senior citizens over 60 do?
According to the health department -
Senior citizens above the age of 60 should walk for 3 minutes instead of 6 minutes.
It is better to have someone with you during the test. 
Senior citizens can take the test by walking for 3 minutes instead of 6 minutes, said Dr. Pandit also says.
What does the result of this test say?
Exercise changes heart rate and oxygen levels. 
This can help determine if the body's oxygen levels are low.
According to the health department -
If the oxygen level in the blood does not decrease after walking for six minutes, then you are in good health
If the oxygen level drops by 1-2 percent, there is no reason to worry.
Test twice a day to see if there is any change
To explain what the figures before and after the test say, Dr. Iranians give examples.
"The oxygen level before the test will be 97 and then 95. 
So, don't worry.
A 2-3 percent difference after the test is normal.
But, if you see too much difference in the oxygen level, that's a concern."
When to seek immediate advice?
According to the state health department -
After six minutes of walking, the oxygen level dropped to less than 93
Shortness of breath
Oxygen levels dropped by more than three percent
In case of any of the above, seek immediate medical advice.
Dr. Irani says, "This means that not as much oxygen is needed in the lungs.
So there is a difference in the level of oxygen."
If the oxygen in the body is more than 94 after this test, then there is no need to rush to the hospital.
 You can consult a doctor by informing him about this test over the phone," he said. 
Says Rahul Pandit.
Where can I do this test?
According to the health department -
This test should be done on any hard surface or ground
There should be no ups and downs on the ground where you are going to walk
Do not perform this test on the steps
Walk on the ground in the house
Test where there is maximum free space
What does this test cost?
Dr. Rahul Pandit says, "Doctors, nurses or paramedical staff do not need to be present to perform this test.
Anyone in the family can do this test using a finger pulse oximeter."
All you need is a pulse oximeter, a watch, a stopwatch or your mobile phone.

There were a total of 17 patients in the ICU, 13 of whom have died.
Dr. Vijay Vallabh Covid Care Hospital Officer."
21 patients were shifted to another hospital, including some critically ill patients," Dilip Shah told ANI.
The fire broke out on the second floor of this four-story hospital.
Police officials at the scene told the media, "The AC in the ICU exploded and caught fire at around 3.30 pm. 
At that time, there were 17 patients in the ICU. 
Four patients and staff came out, but the rest could not survive the fire.
There are 80 non-covid patients who are safe. 
The 4 patients who survived the ICU have been shifted to another place.
The dead included 5 women and 8 men.
Pakistan stands firm with India in cowardly crisis - Imran Khan
India is facing this dangerous wave of corona virus. 
Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has said that Pakistan stands firm with India in this crisis.
Imran Khan tweeted, "India is facing this dangerous wave of Corona virus. 
 I am with Indian citizens in this time of crisis. 
Our neighbors and the whole world are fighting against Corona virus. 
I pray that they recover as soon as possible. 
Let's face the global crisis together and with humanity. "
After Imran Khan tweeted this, Indian Twitter users are seen thanking him.
For the past few days, the general public has been talking about the Corona crisis in India on Pakistan's social media.
#PakistanstandswithIndia is also trending on Twitter in India.
The corona crisis in India is getting darker day by day.
Over the last few days, more than 3 lakh coronavirus patients are being diagnosed in India every day.
The corona situation in India is being discussed on media and social media around the world. 
here is a lot of talk about the lack of oxygen and beds.
Neighboring Pakistan is also discussing the Corona situation in India.
Hashtags like #WeCantBreathe, #IndiaNeedsOxygen and #IndianLivesMatter were trending on Twitter in Pakistan on Friday (April 23).
More than 28,000 tweets have been made so far using the hashtag #IndiaNeedsOxygen.
 Also, the number of tweets using the hashtag #WeCantBreathe is over 54,000.
Despite political tensions between the two countries, it is a matter of special concern for Pakistani citizens to seek India's help.
' Im Ran Khan to help the '
Journalist Wajahat Kazmi tweeted using the hashtag #Indianeedsoxygen.
The situation in India is worrying. 
Everyone from Kovid should be healed, pray for India, he said.
Pakhtun social activist Usama Khilji called on Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan to help India.
"On behalf of thousands of Pakistanis, I urge the government to help India with its oxygen. 
It is gratifying to see the hashtags #IndiaNeedsOxygen and #IndianLivesMatter trending in Pakistan.
De Kamal said, "Pakistan is expected to forget its internal differences and supply India with what it needs.
The photos and news there are frightening.
Humanity comes first."
Also, India is a neighbor, not an enemy, tweeted Salman Haider.
Preaching to both countries
Ammar Hashmi's Twitter account provided a dose of advice to both countries. 
Using the hashtag #WeCantBreathe, he wrote, "The situation would have been different if the two countries had focused on health care rather than spending money on the military."
Usman Mehboob says, "We have to help India by putting aside political or historical differences, otherwise we have to say that humanity has died."
Many are advising Pakistan to learn from India.
Many are saying that Pakistan should equip its system.
Tuba Jamali tweeted, "India's health system collapses even though it is better than ours. 
This strain of Covid-19 is extremely dangerous. 
Pakistan should be locked down immediately. 
We cannot afford to increase the number of patients due to lack of oxygen."
The third wave of corona is spreading rapidly in Pakistan. 
The number of patients here is also increasing rapidly. 
The burden on hospitals in Pakistan is also increasing.
In the last 24 hours, 5480 new corona patients were found in Pakistan.
Corona also reported 144 deaths.
The highest number of deaths have been reported in Punjab.
The number of patients in need of ventilators and oxygen beds is increasing rapidly in the major cities of the country.
Virafin drug for treatment of corona allowed in India for emergency use
As the Corona outbreak peaked across the country, there was some promising news. 
It is Zydus Cadilla, a healthcare drug approved by the Board of Regulators of Drugs of India.
Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) has approved Zydus Cadillac Virafin for the treatment of patients with mild corona infection.
The full name of this drug is Pegylated Interferon alpha-2b or PegIFN.
This is an Emergency Approval and can be used in limited quantities, DCGI said.
The company had said in its application to DCGI, "The drug helps patients recover faster and reduces the complications involved in their treatment."
He had also said that the drug would be given to patients in hospitals or special treatment institutions only on a doctor's prescription.
Tests conducted at 20-25 locations across the country found that the use of the drug Virafin reduced the patient's need for oxygen.
That is, virafin was helping to improve respiration.
The drug could also be used to treat other viral infections, the company said in an application to DCGI.
This means that to some extent, the drugs that used to be relied upon to save patients' lives are now likely to be reduced.
In addition, Zydus Cadila is working on a corona vaccine. 
The vaccine, called ZycovD, is being developed on a DNA platform. 
For this, Zydus Cadilla is enlisting the help of the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India.  
And the third phase of its clinical trials has been completed.
Corona: Just ambulances everywhere, piles of corpses, anguish
The second wave of covid in the country is infecting in a dangerous manner. 
Corona is located in Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state in the country.
As the corona continues to spread, it is becoming clear that the system is becoming inadequate. 
Although the administration claimed that things were under control, people expressed their grievances to the BBC.
Kanwajjit Singh's father Niranjan Pal Singh, 58, died on Friday while being transported from one hospital to another.
Four hospitals had refused to admit them due to unavailability of beds.
Speaking from Kanpur, he said, "This is the worst day of my life for me."
 If Baba had been treated on time, his life would have been saved. 
The police, the health administration, the government, no one helped us.
Since the corona crisis hit the country last year, 8,51,620 people have been infected in Uttar Pradesh. 
In Uttar Pradesh, corona killed 9,830 people.
 At the time of the first wave, the situation in Uttar Pradesh was not so dire. 
The second wave has put people in a vulnerable position.
Officials say the situation is under control.
However, the huge crowds at hospitals in Lucknow, Varanasi, Kanpur and Allahabad, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, the number of patients being sent back due to lack of beds, and the situation of cheetahs burning 24 hours a day in cemeteries have become a topic of discussion at the national level.
The largest state in the country
With a population of 24 crore, Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state in the country. 
The sixth citizen of the country is a resident of this state, so big is this state. 
Geographically, if Uttar Pradesh were an independent country, it would have become the largest country in the world after China, India, USA and Indonesia. 
Uttar Pradesh would have had more area than Pakistan and Brazil.
Uttar Pradesh is also important politically. 
Though Prime Minister Narendra Modi is originally from Gujarat, he had won the election from Varanasi. 
It is their constituency. 
Uttar Pradesh has 80 MPs in Parliament. 
Despite the strength in Parliament, ie at the national level, development in Uttar Pradesh is not as it should be.
There are 1,91,000 active cases of corona in Uttar Pradesh. 
The number of patients infected with corona is increasing every day.
The high number of people infected with the corona has raised questions about the state government's health care system. 
Those infected with the corona include Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, cabinet colleagues, dozens of officials, hundreds of doctors, nurses and health workers.
In the last few days I have spoken to many in Uttar Pradesh. 
In a video shared by a journalist working in Kanpur, a patient is lying on the ground in the parking lot of Lala Lajpat Rai Government Hospital. 
A short distance away, an elderly man is sitting on the bench. 
Both of them have corona but they are in such a condition as the bed is not available.
Outside the government's own Kanshiram Hospital, a girl cries as two hospitals refuse to admit her ailing mother.
The girl was crying, the hospital said, adding that she did not have a bed.
 If there is no bed, at least keep it on the floor but treat it. 
There are many people like me. 
 I have seen many patients being sent back.
The CM says there are enough beds. 
Show me where the beds are?
The situation in the capital Lucknow is just as bad.
A photo of Sushil Kumar Srivastava sitting in a car and wearing a face mask is on social media. 
He was rushed to his home to be admitted to the hospital. 
By the time they got to bed, it was too late.
We called his son Ashish. 
He said he had not recovered from the grief and could not speak. 
You know what happened. 
I'm not in a position to speak anymore.
The letter written in Hindi by retired Judge Ramesh Chandra was shared by many on social media.
His wife had a corona.
He requested the administration in a letter to take his wife's body out of the house for cremation. 
But they did not get any answer from anyone.
He wrote in the letter- My wife and I had a corona. 
 Called several government helpline numbers since yesterday. 
Called at least fifty times.
But no one came to give medicine, to take him to the hospital. 
My wife died because of poor administration.
Nirmala Kapoor, 70, who had been living in Varanasi, Modi's constituency, for several years, died at a hospital here on Thursday.
His son Vimal Kapoor said the situation was dire.
Vimal says, I have seen many die in ambulances.
Hospitals are not ready to admit patients because they do not have adequate facilities. 
Shopkeepers do not have drugs as well as injections. 
Oxygen is not enough.
The mother was taken to the cemetery where there was a pile of dead bodies.
The price of wood for the cheetah was tripled.
he funeral takes half an hour.
The bodies were so large that it took five to six hours.
I have never seen such a scene before.
Ambulances and piles of corpses everywhere you look.
The real picture is not in front of the public
The number of corona patients in the state is increasing day by day between the deaths due to covid and the families devastated by it. 
On Sunday, 30,596 new patients were registered in Uttar Pradesh. 
Most patients became infected with corona in one day.
Opposition leaders and activists have not been able to give a true picture of the Corona outbreak.
he state is not conducting large-scale corona tests and is protesting against allegations that the true number of corona deaths is being concealed due to non-compliance with private laboratory statistics.
Opponents claim the facts are clear.
Many of the people we spoke to had not been tested.
Although many were corona positive, their names were not registered in state government statistics.
Ajay Singh, 62, of Lucknow, sent me his wife's positive report.
However, his wife's name is not mentioned in the list of positive patients on the state government's website.
The names of Niranjan Singh of Kanpur and Nirmala Kapoor of Varanasi were among the deaths due to corona in the state but the death certificate did not mention corona death.
The media has also questioned the government's corona death toll.
According to media reports, there is a mismatch between the deaths in Lucknow and Varanasi due to cheetah burns and corona deaths.
The government missed the opportunity
Anshuman Rai, director of Heritage Hospital, a private hospital in Varanasi, said the current situation was unprecedented. 
Many doctors, nurses, health workers, lab technicians are falling ill as the health system collapses.
In such a situation where we have to contribute two hundred per cent, we cannot contribute even one hundred per cent.
Because the health system is completely dependent on manpower.
Opposition groups called for a boycott of the by-elections in protest of the second wave.
Nothing was done between September and February. 
Opposition groups called for the beleagured PM to resign. 
The state could also deposit medicines along with the Oxygen Bank. 
But the government missed the opportunity.
As the Corona monster spreads rapidly, there is no hope of recovery.
Corona virus: What is the type of virus in India? 
Scientists around the world are researching a new strain of corona virus found in India. 
But it is not yet clear how far it has spread and how much it has to do with the second, more deadly wave of covid in India.
What is the variant in India?
Changes in all viruses are called mutations. 
This leads to many variants of the virus.
Many of these mutations are not even noticeable, some mutations weaken the virus but some make it more contagious, making it harder for the vaccine to affect it.
The Indian variant - B1617 - was first seen in October.
Where is the Indian variant spread?
The scope of sample testing in India is not enough to say where and how fast this variant of corona has spread.
It was found in 220 samples, or 61% of the 361 genome sequencing samples in Maharashtra between January and March.
According to the GISAD database, the Indian corona has been found in 21 countries.
The UK's health minister says 103 cases of mutations found in India have been found in the UK. 
This is likely to have happened due to international travel.
 The majority of passengers coming from India are now banned by the UK.
Public Health England has categorized the Indian variant as a 'research variant', but has not yet classified it as a 'worrying variant'.
Is India's corona more contagious or dangerous?
A virologist at Louisiana State University, Dr. Jeremy Camille says, "One of the mutations in the Indian variant is similar to the one found in South Africa and Brazil.
Experts say it is too early to say whether the Corona variant in India is more dangerous than the UK mutation.
The UK variant is spread across more than 50 countries.
Why so little information about the Indian variant?
Experts say that information about the Indian variant is still incomplete.
The Indian variant has received 298 samples from India and 656 samples from around the world, while the UK variant has 384,000 samples available.
The first patients of this variant were registered in India. 
Since then, less than 400 patients of this variant have been registered worldwide,Says Kamil.
The new variant responsible for the second wave?
More than two lakh patients have been found in India every day since April 15, with the highest number of patients in the first wave being 93,000. 
The death toll is also steadily rising.
Ravi Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at Cambridge University,says, "India's huge population and density are conducive to mutations in the virus."
But behind the second wave of covid could be a large crowd, as well as a lack of adherence to masks and social distance.
Dr. Jeffrey Barrett of the Wellcome Singer Institute says, "The new variant may be the cause of the increase in morbidity, but it requires solid evidence."
Dr Barrett says the variant has been around since the end of 2020.
"If this variant is behind the second wave, it has taken months for that to happen, so we can say that it is less contagious than Kent's B117 variant."
Will the vaccine work on the new variant?
Experts say that all of these new types of coronavirus vaccine will help prevent serious illness caused by the coronavirus.
Some variants will sidestep the existing vaccines but will require some changes in the composition of the vaccines. 
The existing vaccines will help slow down the spread of the virus, experts say.
Dr. Jeremy Camille says, "Whether you get sick or have mild symptoms, there is a risk of death and it's time to be hospitalized.
 It depends on whether you get vaccinated or not. 
The first thing you get is to get rid of the vaccine. Don't. "
'Hang' if oxygen supply is disrupted - Delhi High Court
The Delhi High Court has warned that if any administrative authority at the central, state or local level interferes with the supply of oxygen, we will not let it go.
The court made the remarks during a hearing before a two-judge bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli on oxygen scarcity in Delhi.
Maharaja Agrasen Hospital in Delhi has filed a petition regarding the shortage of oxygen. 
The petition is being heard.
"The Delhi government should give an example of those who disrupt the supply of oxygen to Delhi. 
The Delhi Government should inform the Central Government about such officers. 
So that action can be taken against them, the High Court has said.
The court slammed the central government
During the hearing, the High Court also slammed the central government.
You had promised on April 21 that Delhi would be supplied 480 metric tonnes of oxygen daily.
But when will this happen?
Most of the hospitals in the capital Delhi are deficient in oxygen.
It is affecting critically ill patients.
On Friday (April 23), 20 people died due to lack of oxygen at Jaipur Golden Hospital in Delhi.
While government hospitals like LNJP and private hospitals like Saroj and Fortis Hospital are also experiencing oxygen shortage.
Oxygen shortages in Delhi hospitals
Oxygen deficiency has claimed the lives of 20 patients at the Jaipur Golden Hospital in Delhi.
Some oxygen tankers have been admitted to the hospital after the Jaipur Golden Hospital informed that there was only half an hour's supply of oxygen.
Two days ago, the central government had increased the oxygen quota for Delhi.
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had also thanked the Center for that.
But at the same time, Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had said that even with the quota increase, the supply of oxygen from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh was being disrupted.
Chief Minister Kejriwal discussed the matter with Haryana Chief Minister Manoharlal Khattar.
At that time, he had promised full cooperation to Delhi, Kejriwal had said.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Modi held a high-level meeting on oxygen and directed the states to supply oxygen.
Oxygen shortage is also seen in Maharashtra.
Health Minister Rajesh Tope has also expressed concern over this.
Submit a detailed plan to fight against Corona- Supreme Court
The Supreme Court has slammed the central government for taking cognizance of the Corona situation in the country. 
The Supreme Court has sent a notice to the Central Government. 
The Supreme Court has asked the Modi government what is your plan on the situation in the country.
A three-member committee headed by Chief Justice Sharad Bobade took note of the shortage of oxygen, shortage of medicines and lack of facilities.
The current situation is worrisome, the chief justice said.
The Center has said that it should take definite measures regarding the supply of oxygen to the states, the status of medicines and vaccines.
Corona vaccine: 'Take one dose of the vaccine, but reduce the risk of infection at all ages'
"Even a single dose of Oxford AstraZeneca (also known as Covishield in India) or Pfizer vaccines can reduce the incidence of Covid-19 infection," said a study in the UK.
The vaccine has benefited senior citizens over 75 years of age, patients with comorbidities and other citizens of all ages.
A study by The Office for National Statistics and Oxford University found that both types of vaccines produced strong antibody responses at all ages.
He said people who had been vaccinated with either vaccine had a similar response.
This research consisted of two study essays, which have not yet been published or reviewed by other researchers. 
But the research studied 370,000 people in the UK. 
This is the first study to study such a large number of people.
This study does not include controlled trials, but real-world study findings.
Exactly how the vaccine works against Covid-19 shows how people are protected from the corona virus.
The first study found that people who took a single dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca (Covishield) or Pfizer vaccine had a 65 percent lower risk of contracting the new corona virus.
Protection from new variants
A study of vaccines administered between December 2020 and April 2021 found that 3 weeks after vaccination, the incidence of asymptomatic infections decreased by 74%, while the incidence of asymptomatic infections decreased by 57%.
Those who received a second dose of Pfizer had a 90 percent lower risk of infection.
But in the case of Oxford-AstraZeneca, this could not be confirmed because very few people in the study received a second dose of the vaccine.
But the study found that both vaccines work against the Kent variant (B117), which was prevalent in the UK at the time.
Dr. Coen Powells, who works in the Department of Population Health at Nutfield, Oxford, said:
"The protection given after the first dose proves that there should be a gap of 12 weeks between the first and second doses. 
This will increase the duration of protection from the first dose and reduce the number of patients admitted to the hospital as well as the mortality rate."
However, he emphasized that people who have been vaccinated can also be infected with covid and should follow social distances and wear masks even after being vaccinated.
A second study found a strong antibody response in about 46,000 adults who took the first dose of the vaccine. 
This means that the vaccine strengthens the body's immune system to fight the corona virus.
The researchers said the antibody response "lasted about 10 weeks."
After the Oxford-Astrazeneka vaccine, the body's antibody response gradually increased, and their levels decreased. 
Antibody response increased rapidly after vaccination with Biotech-Pfizer but also declined rapidly, especially in the elderly.
Antibody response in people over 80 years of age
After taking both doses of the vaccine, the response was better in the young than in the old. 
However, the study found that after Pfizer vaccination, antibody levels increased in all age groups.
But one finding that surprised researchers was that after the second dose of the vaccine, the immune response increased significantly in people over the age of 80 - many times more than even in young people.
Researchers say this research underscores the importance of taking both doses of the vaccine. 
But it is not yet clear how antibodies are formed after vaccination of covid.
The main researcher of this research is Pvt. "It's not yet clear exactly how much antibody response people will need or how long it will take to save people from Covid-19 for a long time," said Sarah Walker.
How are different variants of the Corona found in different countries?
At the end of 2020, a new variant of the Corona was found in India, which was previously found in the UK.
According to health officials, genetic mutations in the corona virus may be more contagious. 
Furthermore, even current corona vaccines may fail to provide complete protection against it. 
More study on this is of course needed.
What is the new variant of Corona virus in India?
Thousands of types of corona currently exist.
More than 100 cases of corona variants in India have been found in the UK.
This Indian variant is also called as B.1.617. 
This may seem like a big number. 
However, this is only one per cent of the genetic mutations analyzed in the UK.
According to the Department of Public Health in England, some of these cases are not related to international cases. 
The search is on to find out how they got infected.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has canceled a visit to India. 
Moreover, England has put India on a 'red list' to prevent the spread of corona through passengers.
However, there is no information or statistics yet to confirm that the Indian variant of the Corona is a 'Variant of Cocern'. 
The concept is used for variants in the UK, Brazil and South Africa.
Or, this variant does not appear to be directly responsible for the recent increase in coronary heart disease in India.
What are the variants in UK, Brazil and South Africa?
New strains of the corona can also become more rapidly infected and weaken the immune system.
The UK or Kent variant (also known as B.1.1.7) is currently seen in many parts of the UK. 
The same variant has been found in more than 50 countries and is changing again.
The South African variant (also known as B.1.351) has been found in at least 20 countries, including the UK.
It is not unexpected that a new variant has been created.
 As the virus spreads, it changes its form and spreads.
The changes in most of these viruses are inconsistent. 
Some variants are endangered, while others are more contagious.
Are the new variants more dangerous?
No evidence has yet been found that the new variants could have a more serious effect on a patient infected with the corona.
Depending on the original type of corona, older people and those with other ailments may also face more stress in these variants.
Considering the UK variants, some research has suggested that the risk of patient death could increase by 30 per cent. 
However, this evidence cannot be considered as a final conclusion.
To prevent infection, you need to be more careful about hand washing, keeping distance, and wearing a mask.
How are the new variants changing?
Variants in the UK, South Africa, Brazil and India have seen changes in their spike protein.
The virus infects human cells.
The mutation virus, known as N501Y, has been shown to be more potent in infecting and spreading cells.
According to experts, the UK and Kent variants are more than 70 per cent contagious. 
According to the UK Department of Public Health, the same percentage is between 30 and 50 per cent.
Variants from South Africa and Brazil have been shown to be more capable of turning into spike proteins
his involved a significant genetic mutation called E484K.
Therefore, they can penetrate the human body's immune system i.e. antibodies. 
These antibodies are already given to you by infection or by vaccination.
They can fight corona on previous experience of infection or due to vaccine.
Experts have also noticed this change in some UK variants recently.
Some important changes have been found in the Indian variants (E484Q, L452R and P681R), which may save the immune system. 
Therefore, experts are currently studying it urgently.
Can the vaccine fight with the Corona variants?
The corona vaccine is actually made with the original virus in mind.
However, experts believe that the new variant may not be as effective as it should be, but at least it may be useful.
According to a recent study, the Brazilian variant can resist antibodies in those who have already had a corona and have some degree of immunity.
Some laboratory findings and factual information suggest that the Pfizer vaccine may be effective on newer variants. 
However, the extent of this effectiveness is low.
The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine team suggests that the vaccine is equally effective against the new UK variant
However, while the vaccine may be less effective against the South African variant, it does prevent patients from becoming serious.
The modern vaccine works effectively against the South African variant.
The immune response may not be as strong or long lasting.
Although two new vaccines, Novavax and Johnson, have not yet been approved, they appear to be defending variants of the corona.
According to experts, even if the new virus changes, so can the vaccine.
The UK government has announced that it has already signed an agreement with biopharmaceutical company CureVac to develop a vaccine that fights new variants.
In addition, 5 crore doses have already been ordered.
Ashok Tupe: The last words written by a journalist who died due to corona were
Ashok Tupe, a senior journalist from Ahmednagar, died of a heart attack after recovering from a corona.
Three senior journalists died on Thursday (April 22nd) amid a sharp rise in the number of corona patients in the state.
These include Ahmednagar Lok Sabha MP Ashok Tupe, Osmanabad senior journalist Motichand Bedmutha and Sopan Bongane.
In Delhi too, some journalists have died due to corona.
News laundry journalist Ashish Yechury's death in Corona has sparked mourning in journalism circles.
The number of journalists killed by corona in Maharashtra has now reached 105, the Marathi Press Council has informed.
In Corona's time, many journalists have reported on the field, considered essential services but not frontline workers. 
That's why many journalists who go to the field at risk have not yet received the corona vaccine, say veteran journalism veterans.
Who was Ashok Tupe?
Ahmed Tupe, a senior journalist from Ahmednagar, has died of a heart attack after recovering from a corona. 
Tupe has been undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Ahmednagar for the past several days.
Ashok Tupe was an important name in the field of journalism in the state.
He was honored with the Vasantrao Naik Agricultural Journalist Award of the Government of Maharashtra. 
Originally from Shrirampur, he was working as a correspondent for the Ahmednagar edition of the Loksatta newspaper.
Ashok Tupe was instrumental in co-operation, agriculture, rural development, politics. 
He also studied many things from anthropology to history, ABP said.
Last message goes viral
Ashok Tupe had sent a message to one of his relatives while he was suffering from corona. 
This message is now going viral.
In the message, Ashok Tupe says, "I have covid and I am undergoing treatment.
 I was traveling in a car with a friend when I was hit by a corona.
Use a double mask.
Don't take off the mask until you get home.
I'm having a bad experience.
The phone is off.
The boy is texting because he's out.
Be careful. 
Don't go to shraddha, funeral, wedding, sugarplum or other events. 
Don't be too crowded.
My wife and I are both being treated in the same room.
 It's been six days. 
But now nature is stable. "
A few days after this message, Ashok Tupe passed away.
His covid was healed. 
But in the end, he died of a heart attack.
Many people are paying homage to Tupe by keeping his message status.
People are making each other aware of the danger and dire situation of the corona.
State President of Maharashtra Youth Congress Satyajit Tambe paid homage to him.
He said that he was saddened by Tupe's demise.
BJP leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil has also paid homage to him. 
He lost a learned friend who worked on agricultural co-operation and rural issues, he said.
Three journalists killed on the same day
Three journalists, including Ashok Tupe, were killed in the same day in the state.
Motichand Bedmutha, the founder of Samay Sarathi in Osmanabad, former president of Osmanabad District Marathi Journalists Association, a senior journalist, passed away in Hyderabad today. 
He was 69 years old.
He was currently working as the Maharashtra State Representative of Osmanabad District Marathi Press Association. 
He served as the Osmanabad district correspondent of the Maharashtra Times and was the founding editor of the Osmanabad-based daily Samay Sarathi.
Sopan Bongane, a senior journalist from Thane, also passed away in Pune today.
The number of journalists killed in the state due to corona has now reached 105, informed S. of Marathi Press Council. M. Deshmukh as well as senior journalist Jatin Desai have also given.
The death of three senior journalists on the same day in the state has spread mourning in the field of journalism along with their families.
Journalists should get the status of frontline worker - Nikhil Wagle
Corona's death has been widely reported on social media by senior journalists in the state.
On this occasion, senior journalist Nikhil Wagle has once again demanded that journalists should get the status of frontline workers.

Maharashtra Lockdown: 9 questions in your mind and their answers
Restrictions in Maharashtra have been tightened under the state government's 'Break the Chain' initiative.
Implementation of the new rules began April 8, at 8 p.m. 
But there are still many questions in the minds of ordinary people.
Here are 9 important questions and their answers.
1. Can doctors and people in the medical field travel in the district without any restrictions?
Answer - Yes. 
Doctors and people in the medical field can travel within the district using the identity card issued by the administration. 
They can use private / private or public vehicles for this journey.
But the reason for their trip is expected to be related to medical and health.
2. Who can use local train?
A. Local trains in Mumbai can be used only by government employees / officials and health workers. 
Apart from them, no one is allowed to travel by local. 
Employees of essential services who are exempted in exceptional circumstances as per the order of the government will not be allowed to travel by local train.
3. Who can take the service of taxi or rickshaw?
Answer : Taxis or rickshaws can be used by the people who have been included in the required services or concessions as per the government order as well as for some valid reasons like going to exams, going to the airport and going to the railway station or bus station to catch long distance trains.
Taxis or rickshaws can also be used in medical emergencies.
4. Is inter-district travel allowed?
Answer - Inter-district travel by private car or other means of transportation will be permitted only for essential purposes other than buses and long-distance trains. 
Essential causes include medical emergencies, family deaths.

Corona: Is the doctor's mental health deteriorating?
The husband of a nurse working at Kasturba Hospital contracted corona.
He was admitted to Kasturba Hospital.
I used to talk to him every day.
I used to do counseling.
I used to believe that you would get better.
"Our nurse used to tell me every day, sir, please do something.
She had to be put on a ventilator for 28 days.
But then she died.
The nurse was pregnant at the time.
I was numb after her husband died.
Looking at the nurse's face, she remembers the incident.
Couldn't you do anything? This question comes to my mind again and again.
My family calls me, you don't talk like before, you don't smile.
Why are you so tense?
The current situation, the deaths due to inadequate facilities and the struggle to save new patients by leaving them behind.
The condition of the patients is constantly in front of our eyes.
What if this situation befalls our family?
This fear does not go away.
Dr. Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai. 
Sahil Moriwala was sharing his experience. 
He had a sore throat while saying this. 
Moriwala had also treated the very first patient in Mumbai. 
He has been serving patients ever since.
There are 200-250 patients in my ward.
5-10 of them are in critical condition.
They need ventilators to be moved to the intensive care unit.
But since there is no space in the intensive care unit, they just have to be put on oxygen.
Many patients have lost their lives due to this.
At that time, we are helpless, "Sahil added.
The whole country is currently on the run in the second wave of Covid. 
The condition of the doctors at the center of the wave has also worsened. 
While returning the first wave of Kasambas, the same second wave has collided more intensely. 
So doctors are physically tired. 
But maintaining morale is also a major challenge for them. 
We tried to know the plight of other doctors like Sahil on the same subject.
Bharat Jain, who works as a visiting doctor in some hospitals in Dombivli, shares his experience. 
He says, "A 34-year-old pregnant woman went on a ventilator.
The hospital ran out of oxygen.
The day ends thinking about what will happen tomorrow.
Young patients die.
"Patients with stroke have to be sent home with medication.
The tension we go through every day comes home automatically.
It affects the family."
Prasanna Phutane, who works at Sassoon Hospital in Pune, is no different.
"In the morning, the whole lobby is full of patients.
Many are cowardly positive.
Some are begging for beds, some are crying, some are crying.
"Many people are crying and saying, 'There is no space in our house. Admit our patient here.'
How and how much to explain to the relatives of the patients?
So we have been enduring this every day for the last year.
If I have a bed, why don't I give it to you?
I am not your enemy.
How can I explain this to the relatives of the patients? "
Prashant Munde, a resident doctor working at Sassoon Hospital, says, "Patients' relatives often shout at us.
You don't have beds?
No oxygen?
No injections. What are you doing?
The government is angry with us.
But we can't say anything. "
More stress in young doctors?
This situation is not only for doctors in big cities but also for doctors all over the world. 
According to some global researchers, including Corona, mental health complaints are more prevalent among healthcare workers in the UK, US, Italy, China and India.
A survey conducted by the psychiatric department at Sassoon Hospital found that doctors in the hospital's medicine department had a 70-75% reduction in mental stress and desire to work. 
Other doctors found 50% stress and burnout (unwillingness to work).
Psychiatrist Dr. Rajendra Barve says, "The Indian Medical Association had organized a camp on mental health for doctors.
The response to this camp was twice as high as before.
The number of resident doctors in particular was higher.
The lives of those resident doctors have changed with this."
There is not much time left in the lives of Corona patients to do other than treat their patients.
The frustration with the system, the work they have to do against their will, puts those doctors under a lot of stress.
Experienced doctors have a degree of depression and anxiety.
How to keep mental health healthy?
At present, it is not possible for a doctor to go on vacation, have fun or spend more time with family. 
We have to face constant negative situations. 
Patients have to face the wrath of their relatives.
 We have to work against our will without learning what we have come to learn.
For this, psychiatrist Dr. Rajendra Barve says, "Doctors should do a 'micro vacation'.
This means that even if you get 5-10 minutes a day, you should try to get out of this situation mentally.
We could not save some patients due to inadequate facilities. Should be done.
"Patients, their relatives are angry about the system.
Even if they are blaming you for the current situation, they know what the doctor's fault is somewhere.
If such a situation arises, it should be handled positively.
What you are doing is an opportunity as a doctor.
I have to make up my mind that I will use the opportunity. "
Corona: Had it not been for the lockdown, the situation in Maharashtra would have been dire
If people are not careful, the number of deaths per day in India from the first week of June will be over 2,300," the statement may seem a bit exaggerated, but a report has been published in the prestigious Lancet.
Maharashtra has been hit the hardest by the second wave of corona. 
 This article tries to find out how the situation in Maharashtra would have been if it had not been for the lockdown.
Strict lockdown is being implemented in Maharashtra from today (April 22). 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that states should consider lockdown as a last resort. 
Then there was a lot of debate about whether there would be a lockdown in the state.
It is also said that the number of corona patients in the state would have gone up to one million in a fortnight if there had not been a lockdown.
Will the number of patients cross 10 lakh by May 2?
There are currently 6,83,856 active patients of corona in the state. 
The number of patients is estimated to be 10,94,996 by May 2, according to the administration.
The state has a shortage of hospital beds, oxygen and ventilators.
 The administration fears that with the increase in the number of patients, the shortage of bed facilities, oxygen and ventilators in the hospital will increase and the situation will get out of hand.
As per the above data, the number of beds for patients is deficient in 28 out of 35 districts in the state. 
If a strict lockdown is imposed, this situation is likely to change to some extent.
Speaking to media after the cabinet meeting on Tuesday (April 20), Health Minister Rajesh Tope had said, "Given the current situation, every minister in the cabinet meeting should have a strict lockdown.
If the chain is to be broken, there is no alternative but strict lockdown, so all the ministers are urging the Chief Minister to announce the decision soon.
We use 80-90% of hospital beds, oxygen, injections, medicines and doctors.
 Currently there is a community outbreak. 
If the chain is to be broken, strict restrictions will have to be imposed on essential service shops and large-scale traffic, otherwise it will be difficult to bear the burden on the health system. "
Koronacam crisis had severe active ?
As of March 31, the number of corona patients in the state was around 40,000 a day. 
In the last 20 days, the number has gone up to 62,000 a day. 
This is a daily increase of about 22,000 patients in the last twenty days. 
Although this figure appears to be large, the administration says it has also increased the number of corona tests.
According to the report of the Lancet Covid 19 Commission, "If people do not take precautions, the number of corona deaths in the country will be 1750 per day and the number could rise to 2320 from the first week of June." 
The worst of this situation in the country could reach Maharashtra.
There is a huge strain on the health system in the state. 
Beds for patients, oxygen, remedesivir injections are feeling a big tread.
Suresh Boinwad, an ambulance driver at Nanded District Hospital, said, "Last week I got a call that a patient was critical.
I took the 80-year-old patient to the hospital in an ambulance but was told there was no bed.
The bed was not found.
How would I leave the patient on the road? Where would I leave him? I wondered.
The patient had to be kept in the ambulance for a long time.
Then late at night his relatives found a way.
Could this prediction be wrong?
If the number in the state exceeds 10 lakhs, what will happen to the health system? 
Shashank Joshi, chief doctor of the Covid Task Force, said, "These figures were predicted during the first wave of corona.
But often they turned out to be wrong.
Although the numbers are not complete due to the current restrictions, it seems to be stabilizing at 60,000. 
I don't think it will increase to millions in the future. 
On the other hand, the number will stabilize and start declining. 
But for that, people have to sit at home and observe the restrictions. "
Can a complete lockdown make a difference in this situation? 
On this Dr. Shashank Joshi says, "A complete lockdown should be considered when your health system is not functional.
I am not in favor of a personal lockdown.
There should be strict restrictions in the districts where the health system is lacking, and especially the people should abide by it."
Has Modi made a political dilemma of Uddhav Thackeray to avoid lockdown?
While talking about lockdown in Maharashtra, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that states should have lockdown as a last resort. 
But still there was a lockdown in Maharashtra.
He made the statement to avoid public outrage after the lockdown and said that if the lockdown occurs, the responsibility will fall on the states.
Uddhav Thackeray threatened to take a decision that was not in the interest of the people and announced a lockdown. 
Against this backdrop, there is talk that Modi tried to use Uddhav Thackeray's political dilemma to 'avoid lockdown', saying that he made the statement to keep the country's economy afloat. 
BBC Marathi has tried to find out this question.
While the state of Maharashtra was on the verge of a complete lockdown, Prime Minister Modi's instructions to the states about the lockdown were a surprise to them.
Its political repercussions began to emerge in Maharashtra. 
The politics between the Center and the state government, which has been going on for several days, is not stopping.
 Corona doesn't even have time.
On what basis is the Prime Minister's advice to avoid lockdown?
The ongoing lockdown in Maharashtra is being discussed all over the country. 
This time, Prime Minister Modi's statement to avoid lockdown was especially against the decision of the Mahavikas Aghadi government.
As a result, the leaders of the Mahavikas Aghadi have targeted the Prime Minister's speech. 
In the front page of the match, Sanjay Raut says, "64,000 patients are coming to Maharashtra in 24 hours.
The death rate has also increased.
On what basis does Prime Minister Narendra Modi advise to avoid lockdown?"
Corona status has gone out of control in Delhi, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.
The BJP has mobilized people from all over the country for West Bengal.
They have infected the corona and returned to various states.
Haridwar's Kumbh Mela, political fairs in West Bengal have only infected the country with corona."
That is what the match has said.
Sanjay Raut further says, "Modi says we want to return this crisis together.
There is no place for people with opposing views in this unity".
Even during the Corona period, the politics of the state government against the central government continued. 
Giving evidence from the last several days, Raut criticized Prime Minister Modi over the lockdown.
NCP leader and minister Jitendra Awhad has also targeted Modi's speech.
 Jitendra Awhad says, "Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that lockdown could be the last resort.
Where have we forgotten, when you suddenly came one day.
When any Chief Minister did not know any Union Cabinet Minister, you suddenly came and declared lockdown.
How much water to look at?
No CM is happy with the lockdown. 
But for the way corona is spreading in Maharashtra, lockdown is needed. 
Prime Minister Modiji, you should appreciate Maharashtra ".
Modi shifted responsibility to states?
In a statement, Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded the central government's good vaccinations and the fight against corona in the first wave.
Even in the current situation, the central government has tried to show how much effort is being made to make oxygen remedial injections available. 
But what is the politics behind saying avoid lockdown?
Business Standard journalist Aditi Fadnavis says, "Prime Minister Modi has said for the second time that lockdown should be the last resort.
He had said in a meeting with all the state chief ministers that lockdown should be the last resort.
Shortly after this meeting, restrictions were imposed in Madhya Pradesh.
Then why didn't they listen to the Prime Minister? "
Either Modi is unaware of the current situation on the ground or the prime minister wants to shift the responsibility to the state.
But even the state government is finding it difficult to control the situation," said Aditi Fadnavis.
In states where there is no BJP government, states speak against Modi.
But in states where there is a BJP-led government, they cannot speak.
In today's situation, if one goes to the working class and asks who is responsible for this situation?
So, one will seldom mention the name of Prime Minister Modi.
But most people will say that the state government has not done anything.
The politics of shirking responsibility is going on right now," says Aditi Fadnavis.
Oxygen supply: 'Beg, borrow, steal but give oxygen', High Court orders Modi govt 
1. 'Beg, borrow, steal; But give oxygen '- Delhi High Court
Beg, borrow, steal; But give oxygen ', is the word the Delhi High Court has given to the Central Government. 
Loksatta has given this news.
The Delhi High Court has slammed the Modi government after Max Hospital in Delhi filed a petition in the Delhi High Court alleging inadequate supply of oxygen.
A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Patil of the Delhi High Court heard the petition filed by Max Healthcare. 
Max had complained in his petition that there was an insufficient supply of oxygen.
The apex court asked the Center, "Aren't people's lives so important to the government?
We are shocked by the central government's neglect of such an important issue as oxygen.
If necessary, divert oxygen from industries such as steel and petroleum for treatment.
 Consider all the ways to get oxygen from the plant of this industry to the required place.
Even if a special corridor has to be created for that, the government should do it. "
2. Centre's new model for vaccine rate control
The corona vaccine has been available to everyone over the age of 18 since May 1. 
Since then, the government has been developing a mechanism to control the price of anti-corona vaccine in the open market. 
This was reported by Times of India .
While vaccine companies have the right to set their own vaccine in the open market, clinics and other vaccine suppliers may charge higher fees for vaccines.
So the government is thinking of creating a new mechanism to control these prices.
From May 1, private clinics will be able to purchase corona vaccines directly from manufacturers for vaccination of people over 18 years of age. 
There will be a fixed price for that.
 Anyway, everyone above the age of 45 will be provided free vaccines at government centers.
3. Door-to-door vaccination impossible - Ministry of Health
A public interest litigation has been filed in the Mumbai High Court seeking vaccination of senior citizens who have completed 75 years of age as it is not possible for them to go out for vaccination.
On this petition, the Union Ministry of Health submitted its affidavit in the High Court.
 ABP has given this news in my name.
It said that if a door-to-door vaccination campaign is carried out, the test period of 30 minutes after vaccination will not be observed, unfortunately, if any adverse effects of the vaccine are observed, it will not be possible to give immediate medical treatment. 
The corona vaccine needs to be kept at a certain temperature. 
However, the vaccine can be affected if the vaccinated container is carried around the house. 
Vaccine doses are also likely to be wasted during travel. 
The Central Government has mentioned many such reasons in its affidavit.
The affidavit states that more vaccination centers will be set up in the near future and citizens will be able to register for vaccination at the site.
4. Why Modi government did not give priority to citizens? - Priyanka Gandhi
"Why weren't the facilities built even though we knew that another wave of corona was coming?" This is the question that Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi has asked the Modi government. 
This was reported by Indian Express .
Priyanka Gandhi said, "Today there are reports of shortage of beds, oxygen, remedivisor, ventilators across the country.
We had a lot of time to prepare between the first and second waves.
Our country is the largest producer of oxygen.
So why is there a shortage of oxygen?
The facility has not been created.
Why didn't you give priority to the countrymen?
Because you are busy with publicity.
We were watching on TV that Mauritius, Nepal was being vaccinated.
You exported six crore vaccines and gave three to four crore vaccines to the people.
There is a shortage of policies today. "
"5. Corona will do, but will not go home - Rakesh Tikait
For the last 5 months, farmers have been protesting against the Agriculture Act on the Delhi border.
The agitation is claimed to be hampering the supply of oxygen to Delhi.
Commenting on this, farmer leader Rakesh Tikait has said that even if he gets corona, he will go but will not go home. 
Lokmat has given this news.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture and that his confession had been obtained through torture. 
We are quarantined here. 
Corona, however, will be treated at Max Hospital here.
Lockdown Rules: Restrictions are even stricter, these are the 3 important announcements
The state's lockdown rules have been tightened under Break the Chain. 
This decision has been made to prevent the increasing prevalence of corona.
The rules issued on the 13th will be effective till May 1 with new additional rules.
 Let's find out what the new rules will be.
Wedding ceremony
Now only 25 people are allowed for the wedding ceremony. 
Earlier, 50 people were allowed to get married but now the number has halved. 
A wedding ceremony can be held in the same hall in 2 hours. 
Violation of the rules at the wedding ceremony will result in a fine of Rs 50,000.
Passenger transport
Inter-district travel can only be done for important reasons.
 Private car travel in Mumbai will be 50 per cent capacity.
 Private buses can run at 50 percent capacity. 
Cannot travel vertically.
Inter-district travel will require permission from the local emergency management.
Only essential service personnel will have access to the local train. 
Admission will be given after checking iCard.
Rules for government offices
Government offices will continue to operate at 15 per cent capacity.
At a cabinet meeting on Tuesday (April 20), the ministers also agreed to a tough lockdown decision.
Health Minister Rajesh Tope said that a demand was made in the cabinet meeting that citizens of the state should be vaccinated by imposing strict lockdown in the state.
It has been decided to impose strict lockdown in Maharashtra, informed Mumbai Guardian Minister Aslam Sheikh. 
He had said that the state government would announce the rules in this regard.
However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has appealed to the states that lockdown should be the last resort. 
Modi had said that the lockdown should be considered as a last resort, as the lockdown would cause huge financial losses.
Against this backdrop, will Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, while interacting with the people of the state, announce a lockdown today? This has caught everyone's attention.
Strict restrictions were imposed in the state from April 14, including a curfew. 
However, public places are still crowded. 
It was also discussed in the cabinet meeting that people are leaving their homes in the name of necessary work and some concrete measures should be taken against it.
Grocery store hours are seven to eleven in the morning
The timing of grocery stores has also been changed by the government. 
The state government has decided to limit the time of grocery shops from 7 am to 11 am as citizens are out all day in the name of grocery shopping despite the restrictions.
Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said that this decision had to be taken as many people in the state do not follow the rules of corona.
A meeting was held under the chairmanship of Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar to review the issues like enhancing health facilities in hospitals in the state, maintaining oxygen supply, overcoming the problems of doctors and health workers.
The meeting was attended by Health Minister Rajesh Tope, Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde (via VC), Medical Education Minister Amit Deshmukh (via VC), Food and Drug Administration Minister Dr. Rajendra Shingane and other senior officers of the concerned departments were present.
New regulations for rail travel
Under the state government's 'Break the Chain' initiative, new regulations have now been announced for rail travel. 
Accordingly, those coming to Maharashtra from Kerala, Goa, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Delhi and Uttarakhand will have to show a negative report of the corona.
These six states have been declared corona sensitive. 
Railway passengers arriving in Maharashtra from this state are required to take 48 hours pre-RT-PCR test.
Many passengers may not have RT-PCR reports, in which case the railways should provide a facility for rapid antigen testing.
Corona vaccine price: Serum Institute announces vaccine rates for private hospitals
Serum Institute of India has announced vaccine rates. 
Vaccine manufacturers will now give 50 per cent of their production to the central government, while the remaining 50 per cent will be sold to state governments and private hospitals.
For government hospitals and vaccination centers, each dose of Covishield will be available at Rs 400, while private hospitals will be able to buy Covishield at Rs 600 per dose.
Private clinics will then charge their own vaccination fees and announce the rates for each dose of vaccine. 
Therefore, different private clinics are likely to have different rates for vaccination.
It is not yet clear at what rate the state government will sell the doses they have bought.
The Serum Institute said in a statement that it has reduced its rates worldwide for each dose of vaccine.
The 50 per cent vaccines that go to the central government will be distributed by the center to various states and union territories.
The central government had said that the decision would be taken after considering the infection situation in the area and the state administration's vaccination work.
Remdesivir: Did companies reduce supply in Maharashtra due to pressure from the central government? - Nana Patole
1. 'Has the supply of Remedesivir been reduced in Maharashtra due to pressure from the Central Government?' - Nana Patole
Is the Central Government putting pressure on Maharashtra not to supply Remedesivir? 
He also criticized the central government for failing in the Corona crisis, shifting its responsibility to the states and leaving the people to fend for themselves.
In Maharashtra, however, the Congress has demanded that the state government should take out timely loans but complete vaccinations.
 Lokmat has given this news.
The state government had issued two tenders for the supply of Remedesivir injection.
The two companies were supplying 50,000 injections per day to the state till now.
But they abruptly changed their position and asked for 500 injections by May 31.
Is the center trying to make things worse?
3. 'Don't be late for testing' - Rajesh Tope
Health Minister Rajesh Tope has said that the experience of getting sick due to delay is coming from all over the state.
 Therefore, if you see any symptoms of corona, do the test without delay, do not remove the pain on the body, Rajesh Tope has appealed.
He said, "If there are symptoms, start treatment by testing the corona in any situation.
After studying the situation across the state, it was found that the patient was dehydrated due to the delay.
So please do not remove the pain on the limb."
 Loksatta has given this news.
BP, diabetes, etc. 
Despite the disease, the vaccine is beneficial and will play an important role in protecting against the corona epidemic. 
Therefore, everyone over the age of 45 should be vaccinated, he said.
5. Economic interests cannot be greater than human life- Delhi High Court
The Delhi High Court has slammed the Center and the Delhi government for lack of oxygen and wasted vaccines.
The Delhi High Court has said in a hearing that financial interests cannot be greater than human life.
According to Suchitra Mohanty, a senior journalist covering law and court, a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghvi and Rekha Palli during a hearing on Tuesday (March 20) said the court would hear the case on a daily basis in the Corona crisis situation.
The court also said that the central government should immediately ban the industrial use of oxygen in view of the shortage of oxygen in Delhi's hospitals. 
The court said, "Economic interests cannot be more important than people's health.
Why can't oxygen be taken from the Ministry of Petroleum and given to the states?
If there is a shortage of oxygen now, give it now.
Why wait till the 22nd?"
The oxygen supply to some industries has been cut off since April 2, while others will be cut off from April 22, the Center told the court. T
he court slammed the central government for this.
Corona Oxygen Shortage: 'If You Can't Give Medicine and Beds, Give Me a Little Room to Die
I had this morning call. 
A schoolteacher called me. 
Her 46-year-old husband is battling Kovid in a Delhi hospital. 
There is a shortage of oxygen in that place. 
So they called me and asked if I could get an oxygen cylinder.
I spoke to myself. 
Breathing seems to be the order of the day in Delhi.
Hospitals in Delhi are working on a war footing to alleviate the oxygen shortage. 
Phones are texting about oxygen shortages.
When the woman's phone rang, I could clearly hear the beep of the monitor. 
She said her husband's oxygen level was 58. 
After a while it rose to 62. 
If your oxygen level falls below 92, you are advised to consult a doctor.
She says that her husband's oxygen level has increased and she is feeling better now.
I texted one of my doctor friends and asked what the oxygen level should be so that the patient would feel better.
 She says that even if the oxygen level is 40, the patient can talk to you.
'25 patients die due to lack of oxygen '
I picked up the newspaper. 
It read that 25 patients died due to lack of oxygen in a large hospital in Delhi. 
Critical care units are under tremendous stress due to lack of oxygen. 
Many patients are given oxygen manually. 
This means that oxygen is being delivered without the need for critical care equipment.
I was shocked to see a photo on the front page of the newspaper. 
Two men and a woman are getting oxygen supply from an oxygen cylinder.
The general public's recklessness about Kovid and the government's negligence brought the three strangers together in grief.
 read a news a few days ago. 
A man's 40-year-old son died while waiting for a bed outside the hospital.
 At least, he had a stretcher.
 That was mentioned in the news.
The bewildered Indians seem to be grateful for this too.
If you can't give us a bed, oxygen or medicine while you are alive, at least give us a place to burn at death, there are so many helpless people.
As the day progressed, I realized that nothing had changed.
People are dying due to lack of oxygen, the supply of medicine is not enough. 
Even in the black market, medicines are not available even after paying a lot of money. 
There are signs of medicine running out in the shops and people are buying medicines even when they are not needed out of fear. 
It's as if we're at war now.
n many ways, it is a fact that the current situation is warlike.
The teacher called again. 
The hospital did not even have an oxygen flow-meter. 
She was told to arrange it herself.
I phoned. 
Asked for people's help on Twitter. 
One person received it and arrangements were made to deliver it.
No matter what the government says, the situation seems to be getting worse and worse. 
Oxygen tankers do not arrive on time. 
No beds, no medicine.
The affluent class in India used to get some special privileges and good treatment. 
But it seems that their privileges have been taken away. 
I got a call from the editor of a magazine. 
He was looking for an oxygen cylinder for one of his acquaintances.
In the society in which I live, people have bought small oxygen concentrators.
 It helps people who are having difficulty breathing. 
In our society, 57 people have been infected with corona and have been quarantined in their homes.
Patients are left to die on their own. 
Many feel that they are slowly dying. 
Corona seems to be a disease with many monstrous faces.
Paul Kalanidhi, who is practicing in America, had written a book on his memories called 'When Breath Becomes Air'. 
Kalanidhi was diagnosed with lung cancer and died in 2015. 
He had written in his book. 
Although I am dying, even though I am on the verge of death, I am alive until I die.
His statement is coming true now. 
There are only a few things left in the lives of many Indians who are struggling for oxygen, with some compassion left.
Corona: Could India's oxygen shortage have been avoided?
"I was trying to breathe, but I couldn't.
I thought I was going to die."
Shruti (name has been changed as the girl concerned wants her parents not to read that she had to fight with Covid-19).
She put herself in isolation and began to feel that she was in good health.
But when she woke up on April 9, she was having difficulty breathing and her oxygen level had dropped.
"My husband was anxiously calling everywhere.
But most of the hospitals did not have space for new patients or oxygen."
After struggling to breathe for twelve hours, Shruti was finally admitted to a private hospital. 
But it took another two hours to get the bed together and start supplying oxygen.
Ten days later she was released from the hospital and now she is at her home in Mumbai, her health is also improving.
I still feel weak, but I'm glad I'm alive.
My luck was strong that day so I got to bed."
It's been two weeks since the incident, and now countless patients across India have to go through horrific experiences like Shruti - often with devastating consequences.
The battle for breath
Everyone from doctors, officials to journalists who have witnessed the spread of this epidemic in India now have to experience the unfortunate recurrence.
Seven months ago, the country was similarly struggling with oxygen shortages and the number of patients was increasing. 
But today the situation is even worse.
Thousands of people wait three to four days for a bed with oxygen available. 
Many are dying while waiting.
Hospitals have to work hard to accommodate inhaled covid patients, doctors are panicking over the depletion of oxygen stocks, and messages urging for oxygen cylinders are circulating everywhere from the news in the media, to Twitter and the WhatsApp.
How did India get back to this position?
"The situation was so bad that we had to treat some patients in a cardiac ambulance for 12 hours, after which they got beds in the ICU," said Dr. Krishna Kumar, who is the head of Covid Hospital in Pune, Siddheshwar Shinde says.
The number of covid patients in Maharashtra has remained the highest since the onset of this global outbreak. 
Even now, Maharashtra alone accounts for one-third of the total covid patients in India.
Pune is one of the most coveted districts in India. 
So far, Pune ranks second (1,21,200) in the number of corona patients, while Pune ranks third (8,890) in the number of deaths due to the virus.
One day last week when no ventilator was available, Dr. Shinde moved patients to other cities.
 This is unprecedented, as people from nearby districts often come to Pune for treatment. 
The situation is no different in Mumbai, the capital of Maharashtra and the financial center of India. 
About 95 per cent of emergency beds in Mumbai are full.
One-tenth of the total patients in Maharashtra require oxygen proof, experts estimate. 
But the supply of oxygen is not enough. 
Although the state produces about 1200 metric tons of oxygen per day, it has to be used for all oxygen covid patients.
Oxygen demand is also on the rise as the number of patients increases - currently the demand for oxygen in the state is around 1500 to 1600 metric tonnes, and there are no signs of any decline.
This is the case across India as there is a relentless demand for oxygen and it has gone beyond supply.
Generally about 15 percent of the oxygen supply is used for healthcare, and the rest is sent for industrial use.
 But at present, about 90 per cent of India's oxygen supply - 7,500 metric tonnes per day - is sent for medical use, says senior health official Rajesh Bhushan. 
When the first wave of the corona virus reached its peak in mid-September last year, the current demand is many times higher than the 2,700 metric tons of oxygen used daily.
Last year, about 90,000 new patients were found in India every day.
 When Shruti was admitted to the hospital in early April this year, the number of new patients in a single day was around 144,000. 
In two weeks, the daily number of new patients has doubled to over three lakh.
This has put a strain on India's fragile healthcare system and has led to its collapse.
Earlier this week, several major hospitals in Delhi were running out of oxygen - the Chief Minister had to make a public request and the High Court issued stern instructions.
The central government then made arrangements to recharge the oxygen late at night.
In Uttar Pradesh, some hospitals have put up 'Oxygen depletion' signs and two hospitals in Lucknow have asked patients to move elsewhere for fear of oxygen shortages.
Anxious relatives are queuing outside oxygen recharge centers in several cities. 
Special security guards have been deployed at a center in Hyderabad to control the crowd.
The Supreme Court has directed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's central government to come up with a national covid plan to address the oxygen shortage.
'No one knows when it will end'
The central government has been criticized for exacerbating the situation by not allowing election campaigns, Kumbh Mela and other programs to speed up the vaccination campaign. 
Critics say the government has not done much to deal with the second wave.
In October last year - eight months after the launch of the corona in India - the Ministry of Health invited tenders for new oxygen generating projects. 
Of these, 162 manufacturing centers have been approved, out of which only 33 have started work.
 59 centers will start by the end of April and 80 centers by the end of May, the ministry said.
But given the growing number of patients, officials are skeptical about whether this oxygen supply will be adequate. 
In Maharashtra, for example, oxygen production capacity was increased after the first wave, but even the hospitals ready for it are finding it difficult to cope with the deteriorating situation.
Generally, hospitals like ours have adequate oxygen supply.
But in the last fortnight, it has become a huge challenge to keep people breathing.
Even 22-year-old patients have to be supplied with oxygen from outside.
I don't think the government had any idea."
Although oxygen tanks have been installed in many district government hospitals in the state, there is a huge demand for oxygen in small towns and private hospitals.
People are reluctant to go to government hospitals, but these hospitals have a good supply of oxygen, which is likely to save lives," he said. 
Siddheshwar said.
So now the states are setting up new oxygen generating projects or trying to get oxygen from other states.
 And the central government is considering importing 50,000 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen.
 Every supplier is constantly working.
Ganesh Bharatiya, who runs an oxygen recharge center in Nanded, says, "We used to sell 150 to 200 cylinders a day, mostly in the industrial sector.
Now the demand has increased to 500 to 600 cylinders.
They say that even if you work 10-12 hours a day, you can somehow meet the demand.
"There is a slight improvement now, but no one has any idea when it will all end," he said. 
Siddheshwar says.
So doctors are using oxygen as carefully as possible.
"Oxygen supply is very important, but it needs to be streamlined," said Mumbai-based infectious disease specialist Dr. Says Om Srivastava.
But in the current situation, he says, it is impossible to predict how much oxygen a patient will need.
"Not every patient needs a certain amount of oxygen for a certain period of time.
The number of patients in a hospital needs oxygen varies from hour to hour.
The health of a paralyzed patient can suddenly become critical."
The rapid growth in demand for oxygen-powered beds is staggering - they say the demand has grown by almost 50 per cent in just a few weeks.
"We care as much as we can.
But I've never seen anything like it before.
In fact, no one here has ever experienced anything like it."
It is important to note that states like Kerala have increased their oxygen production capacity and are sending extra oxygen to other places, but in places like Delhi, most of the oxygen supply comes from outside.
Problems of distribution as well as supply
While supply is increasing in the states, distribution is also a challenge.
According to the head of one of the largest oxygen suppliers in India, it is a challenge to bring oxygen from eastern India (industrial states like Odisha and Jharkhand have high oxygen supply) to rapidly growing patients in western or northern India (Maharashtra or Delhi).
The pale blue and extremely cold liquid oxygen is at a temperature of 183 degrees. 
As it is a low temperature gas, it has to be stored in special cylinders and tankers for transportation.
About 500 factories in India purify oxygen from the air and supply it to hospitals in liquid form. 
Most of this supply is through tankers. 
Larger hospitals often have their own tanks, where oxygen is stored and then piped directly to patients' beds. 
Small and seasonal hospitals rely on steel and aluminum cylinders.
Oxygen tankers often line up outside projects for hours, and it takes about two hours to fill a tanker. 
Then these tankers take many more hours to reach different cities in different states. 
These tankers have to maintain some speed limit - maximum 40 kilometers per hour. 
Moreover, these tankers do not usually travel at night to avoid accidents.
In some places, oxygen tankers are preferred to ambulances to get out of traffic jams. 
But still it takes 15 to 25 hours for a tanker to reach small towns from big cities.
Increasing the supply and distribution of oxygen requires not only more capital expenditure but also more skilled manpower, a government official said on condition of anonymity.
"Many of the staff at these projects, and even in hospitals, lack these skills, and we're working to prevent leaks and reduce waste."
But oxygen suppliers also point to a lack of political will and readiness.
"We want to increase our capacity, but we will need financial support," said Rajabhai Shinde, who runs a small oxygen production project in Maharashtra.
"But no one said anything about it and now all of a sudden hospitals and doctors are demanding more and more cylinders.
This could have been avoided."
They say that once some health problem arises and they have difficulty getting oxygen, they start an oxygen production project.
"Well, you should dig a well before you get thirsty.
But you didn't do that."
Corona vaccine: Free vaccination for all in Maharashtra, state government decides
In Maharashtra, free vaccination will be given to all above 18 years of age. 
A global tender will be issued to make the vaccine available at cheaper rates and better.
Nawab Malik, National Spokesperson of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Minister for Minorities, said that the free vaccination program would be taken up from the state government's coffers.
The central government has announced a decision to vaccinate people above the age of 18 across the country from May one.
"Covidshield will cost Rs 150 for the center, Rs 400 for the state and Rs 600 for the private sector.
The price of covacin has also been announced at Rs 600 for the states and Rs 1,200 for the private sector," Malik said.
"The rate was discussed in the previous cabinet.
It was unanimously decided to give free vaccines to the people of the state.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had given his nod.
Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar announced it yesterday (April 24)," Malik said.
Earlier, more than 15 states in India announced free vaccination.
Corona: Why is the Narendra Modi government failing to supply oxygen?
There is a huge shortage of oxygen in many parts of the country, including the capital Delhi. 
This condition is seen to have serious effects on critically ill patients.
At least 20 people died at Jaipur Golden Hospital in Delhi on Friday night (April 24) due to lack of oxygen.
Private hospitals like Saroj and Fortis, along with government hospitals like LNJP, also lack oxygen. 
Some helpless hospitals have also taken the matter to court.
Similarly, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh are experiencing severe shortage of medical oxygen.
In Uttar Pradesh, some hospitals have boarded out oxygen out of stock boards.
Some hospitals in Lucknow informed patients about arrangements elsewhere. 
Delhi's small and big hospitals, nursing homes are also seen giving similar instructions.
In many cities, relatives of patients are seen fetching oxygen on their own.
 There are long, long queues for oxygen refilling.
At an oxygen factory in Hyderabad, the crowd grew so large that bouncers had to be called in to control it.
A few days ago, 22 people died due to oxygen leakage in Zakir Hussain Hospital in Nashik.
The accident happened while the tanker was being filled with oxygen.
 Oxygen supply was disrupted for half an hour due to oxygen leakage.
Coronary artery disease patients are free to wait for treatment.
 Hospitals have to work day and night to treat patients with respiratory obstruction.
Fortunately, doctors are working day and night to save the lives of those who have been bedridden.
There will be many posts on social media demanding oxygen cylinders.
But what caused this situation in the country in terms of oxygen? 
Why is it time to increase the demand for oxygen?
What causes oxygen shortages in many states?
Oxygen shortages are well planned by some states. 
Kerala had initially started increasing its oxygen supply.
 He also started keeping an eye on it.
Kerala increased oxygen as the patient began to grow. 
At present Kerala has more oxygen than it needs. 
They are also supplying oxygen to other states.
But Delhi and some other states do not have their own oxygen plants.
 They depend on other states for supplies.
Maharashtra has the highest incidence of corona in the country. 
Maharashtra alone accounts for one third of the total coronary artery disease in the country.
Currently, the state is producing 1200 metric tonnes of oxygen per day. 
But considering the number of patients, this number is not enough. 
The demand for oxygen is increasing day by day. 
Currently 1500 to 1600 metric tons of oxygen is required per day.
Dr. who runs Covid Hospital in Pune. 
"Normally, hospitals like ours get oxygen supply, but there have been special problems over the last two weeks.
Even 22-year-olds need oxygen support," he says.
According to doctors and accompanying pathologists, the number of corona patients is rapidly increasing and they have to wait for tests and treatment. 
As a result, people's health is deteriorating. 
He has to be hospitalized for treatment.
People are hospitalized when the situation becomes serious. 
These patients require high-flow oxygen. 
This has also increased the demand for oxygen. 
There is a greater need for oxygen this year than last year.
Dr. "No one knows when it will end.
I think the government may not have imagined the situation," says Shinde.
How difficult is it to get oxygen to the desired place?
According to experts, it is not a problem of producing oxygen in India, it is a problem of getting it to the right place on time.
Siddharth Jain, Director, Inox Air Products, spoke to BBC correspondent Vineet Khare.
He says, "Medical oxygen production capacity in India was 6500 MT.
It has been increased to 7200 MT per day.
According to Jain, India needed 700 metric tonnes of oxygen per day. 
It is currently 5,000 metric tons per day.
Saket Tiku of the All India Gases Manufacturers Association says, "On the one hand, there is a severe shortage of medical oxygen in Maharashtra.
On the other hand, there is a shortage of oxygen in the factories at Rourkela, Haldia in eastern India."
Special tankers are needed to transport medical oxygen from one place to another. 
This tanker is called a cryogenic tanker.
The medical oxygen is filled in a liquid in the cylinder. 
It is also loaded into cryogenic tankers.
It takes two hours to fill an oxygen tanker. 
So there are long, long queues of tankers outside the factories.
Apart from that, it takes time for these tankers to reach different cities and districts in different states. 
It takes several hours. 
In addition, these tankers have been given a speed limit to run on the road.
These tankers cannot run faster than 40 km per hour. 
The tanker is not operated even at night for fear of accidents.
Allegations transplanted into two states and state-center
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has alleged that oxygen tankers coming to Delhi are being blocked by other states.
The Delhi government has accused the central government of not providing enough oxygen.
In the issue of oxygen shortage in Delhi's hospitals, Union Health Minister Dr. Harshvardhan said, "They have been given quotas as per the demand of the Delhi government.
It is up to them how they use them.
According to ANI, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan made the statement while on a visit to Sardar Patel Covid Care Center Hospital. 
This special hospital has been set up for Covid-19.
 It will start from next week.
Meanwhile, Dr. Harshvardhan said, "Every state in India has been given its share of oxygen in terms of oxygen production.
Delhi has also been given more oxygen than its demand.
Chief Minister Kejriwal had also thanked Prime Minister Modi for this."
The Delhi government now needs to plan for the proper use of oxygen. 
The central government has assured Delhi that there will be no disruption in oxygen supply.
Meanwhile, hospitals in Delhi have also approached the High Court in this regard. 
Even there, the Delhi government made the same argument while presenting its case.
What did the court say?
High courts in northern states, including Delhi and Maharashtra, have slammed the state governments concerned.
 He has directed the state government to bring the situation under control.
The Delhi High Court had on Saturday (April 24) warned that any official from the central, state or local administration who obstructed the supply of oxygen would be hanged.
The Maharaja Agrasen Hospital in Delhi had rushed to the high court as it was experiencing a lack of oxygen for critically ill Corona patients. 
The court made the above statement while hearing the petition.
A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said, "We will not let anyone interfere with the supply of oxygen.
" During the hearing, the court also slammed the central government.
"You had promised on April 21 that 480 metric tonnes of oxygen would be supplied to Delhi every day.
But when will this happen?" That's what the court asked.
How is oxygen produced?
Liquid oxygen is light blue in color and very cold.
 It is a cryogenic gas. 
Its temperature is minus 183 degrees. 
This oxygen can only be transported through specially made cylinders and tankers.
Oxygen is extracted and purified from about 500 factories in India.
It is then converted into a liquid and sent to hospitals. 
Most of the oxygen is supplied from tankers.
Larger hospitals have their own tankers. 
It is filled with oxygen. 
This oxygen then finally reaches the patient. 
Small hospitals use steel or aluminum cylinders.
Did the government try to increase production?
The Union Health Ministry had held an auction in October last year to start the oxygen plant.
Several proposals were received for this. 
Of these, 162 proposals were approved. 
But so far only 33 plants have been able to start. 
Another 59 plants will be up and running by the end of April. 
The remaining 80 plants are expected to be commissioned in May.
What steps is the government taking now?
The central government has decided to import medical oxygen from abroad in view of the shortage of oxygen in the country and the severity of corona infection.
On Saturday, the central government decided to waive customs duty and health tax on imports of oxygen and related equipment for the next three months.
Efforts are being made to import 50,000 metric tonnes of oxygen.
The government's Empowered Group has imposed restrictions on the use of oxygen by all industries except nine.
In addition, the government has allocated funds to build 162 PSA medical oxygen plants.
Rajiv Gupta of Vinayak Air Products Pvt Ltd told the BBC's Vineet Khare: "The oxygen content of the plant is 92-93 per cent.
So it can run.
It has a capacity of one to two metric tonnes.
Apart from this, the government is also running Oxygen Express Railway for fast oxygen supply. 
The air force is being called in to help the empty tankers reach the plant.
Why do patients with covidosis need oxygen?
We are taking oxygen in the air through our nostrils. 
Oxygen is absorbed into the bloodstream through your lungs. 
Next it has a chemical reaction with glucose in your blood vessels.
That is, energy is generated from food. 
This is a very important process for any animal. 
The problem of oxygen mixing with the bloodstream is also disrupted if there is a problem with lung function. 
In such cases, the oxygen we get through breathing is insufficient. 
Such patients need to be given pure oxygen.
Oxygen concentrators are sometimes used for this purpose. 
This machine takes oxygen from the air, purifies it and supplies it to the patient.
 It is easy to use. 
But experts say it is not enough to give corona patients oxygen in such a way.
Corona patients have to be given oxygen through cylinders and pipes. 
No further details have been released. 
The doctor decides whether to give the corona oxygen to the patient by machine or by cylinder.
The Food and Drug Administration of the Government of Maharashtra is seeking more information. 
The oxygen concentrator is being used to determine whether covid patients are being helped.
Patients in the shadow of the corona, desperate relatives and strange silence - ground report
There was no oxygen, no beds in the hospitals, no medicine and no ventilators, no lockdown, so I decided to go to the place where the workers were going and get in the car.
I visited many hospitals, went to a bus stand and even went to a train station.
Another vehicle was seen on the road. 
The ambulance was speeding away, sounding a loud siren on the side of my car. 
The sound of their sirens echoed in my ears from afar.
Delhi with a population of two crore is the capital of the country. 
Saturday is a holiday. 
But Corona kept the atmosphere in awe. 
Shops and malls are closed. 
There were a lot of people out there who needed a pass.
The lockdown was imposed last Saturday-Sunday in Delhi. 
The lockdown was extended for a week on Monday. 
On Sunday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal indicated that the lockdown would be effective till May 3.
Status of hospitals
This was the scene outside many hospitals in the capital. 
The relatives of the patient are trying to keep his breathing smooth. 
Their relentless struggle to get oxygen continues.
 Fonafoni is on for that. 
They are begging the hospital authorities.
I reached the gate of a hospital, where it was written on the barricade that 'there are no beds available'.
Sick people and their relatives had compassion on their faces. 
I could understand their discomfort.
 There were many neighbors and true friends.
I then felt that the government was almost gone in these difficult times. 
At that time, brotherhood is seen among the people. 
Humanity is alive.
What about Muslims, what about Hindus, what about the rich, what about the poor.
 Everyone is helping each other.
Caring for relatives of patients
I arrived at AIIMS Hospital here.
 It is one of the leading hospitals in the country. 
Patients come here from all over the country.
The premises of this hospital are so big that if you don't know exactly where to go inside, you can lose. 
People of any class, rich or poor, are treated here.
I was allowed to go to Covid Ward and I didn't want to.
 I knew there were good treatments for corona here.
My brother was in the same hospital for twelve days after being infected with corona last year. 
When the brother was recruited, AIIMS director Randeep Guleria said, "Your chances of surviving are fifty per cent." 
But still the brother recovered and came out.
When I arrived at the AIIMS on Saturday, there were a lot of people outside the Coved Ward. 
Most came from outside Delhi. 
He was a financially weak man. 
Many had laid their beds on the sidewalk. 
Some of them were cooking there.
Hospitals also desperate
While talking to people standing outside the AIIMS, I came to know that 20 people had died due to irregular supply of oxygen at Jaipur Golden Hospital. 
Three days ago, 25 people died at Sir Gangaram Hospital due to the same cause.
I reached Jaipur Golden Hospital from AIIMS. 
Two and a half hundred critically ill patients were admitted here. 
They were supplied with oxygen.
Hospital staff said oxygen levels began to drop after midnight and there was a commotion everywhere.
I talked to Richa Avastha. 
She was there with her husband. 
She looked annoyed at the hospital officials.
He said that Jethani was among those who had crossed the border. 
Seema Awasthi was the headmaster of a school in the same area. 
Jethani's children were getting married. 
Our society has lost a good personality.
He said that he had talked to Seema on WhatsApp the night before. 
Later I also came to the hospital. 
They were not allowed to enter the Covid ward. 
But from his WhatsApp, it was clear that his condition was improving.
He blamed hospital officials for Seema's death.
 This is because the hospital officials did not say that the oxygen supply was reduced.
I met another man whose two elder brothers were admitted to Jaipur Golden Hospital. 
The condition of both is fine now. 
With the help of friends, he had an oxygen cylinder ready in the car.
That cylinder was used by his friend's father at home. 
He also had corona but his condition was not serious. 
So on Saturday at eleven o'clock a call came from the hospital that the oxygen had run out. 
When they were told to arrange oxygen for their brothers, they started running with the cylinder.
He became emotional while talking to me. 
Only he who is under the influence of time knows what is happening.
They thanked God that they were able to get both brothers out of trouble. 
They did not need an oxygen cylinder because at the same time an oxygen tanker arrived at the hospital.
The tanker was brought under heavy police security. 
The tanker entered the hospital premises and people cheered spontaneously. 
Hospital staff, including relatives of the patients, breathed a sigh of relief.
The crisis was averted for two days at a hospital. 
But the same crisis persisted in other hospitals.
Oxygen supply to most hospitals in Delhi has been reduced in the last few days. 
But the condition of large hospitals is even worse.
While I was at the Jaipur Golden Hospital, news came that the oxygen supply to the hospital at Shalimar Bagh would be cut off in two to three hours.
I got there. 
The security guards forbade me to go inside. 
I contacted the hospital authorities by phone. 
The Center is blaming Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and private hospitals for managing oxygen.
 That is why the hospital administration is staying away from the media.
He said that oxygen has been provided in Noida and the tanker has left Noida. 
I was there for an hour but the tanker didn't reach anything. 
Shortly afterwards, officials said the tanker had arrived.
Loyalty to the doctor
From Sir Gangaram Hospital to AIIMS, one thing I noticed was the lack of oxygen. 
There is a shortage of beds and ventilators. 
But the repression of doctors, nurses and other staff working in the hospital has not abated.
There is a small garden in front of Gangaram Hospital. 
It is in the hospital premises. 
The congregation working at the hospital was sitting there talking.
Two women wearing PPE kits were eating with a box on the grass.
 She was going to the ward as soon as she ate.
He said that he has been working without any break for the last ten days. 
We are doing this on our own, she said. 
They are working overtime for certain hours every day.
We are ready for the corona infection to spread further.
 Because people are going to need a doctor.
Some women were sitting in front of the reception of Jaipur Golden Hospital. 
One of them was crying. 
She seemed very upset. 
At the reception I asked why no one is paying attention to them?
 I was told that there were no beds available in the hospital.
They have been told about it. 
They don't know where to go now, so they just sit there hoping the bed will be empty.
Migrant workers began to return home
The lockdown was imposed as corona infection was on the rise in Delhi. 
Due to lack of manual labor, the migrant workers marched towards the village again.
 Most of the workers are returning to the village from Anand Vihar bus terminal.
You must have seen the photos of the crowd gathered there. 
The workers who came there with their luggage said that they have got ten days leave. 
So they are going to the village.
The building that was under construction is stalled.
There was also a lot of crowd outside the Anand Vihar railway station. 
Some of the coaches have been converted into coveted coaches.
 It says in big letters that it is forbidden to go inside.
After visiting various hospitals throughout the day, I realized that there is a strange peace in Delhi.
The shop has cooled the market. 
There are no cars on the road, no people.
 Curfew is being observed but people are scared.
 The expression of fear is clearly visible on the faces of the people.
Police and paramilitary forces are deployed on roads and hospitals. 
But there is an invisible fear in the atmosphere that a gun can do nothing.
Iraq: 82 killed, including coroners, in hospital oxygen tank explosion
A fire at a hospital in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, has killed at least 82 people. 
The deaths also included corona patients.
More than 100 people were injured in the crash. 
The incident took place at Al Khatib Hospital in Baghdad.
According to local reports, the fire broke out when the oxygen tank in the hospital burst.
Videos shared on social media show that there was a commotion among the people after the fire broke out and they were running from place to place. 
Firefighters are also seen in the video extinguishing the fire.
Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Qadimi has called the incident "unfortunate" and ordered an investigation.
After the fire broke out, relatives started rushing to find their patients.
A man named Ahmed Zaki had come there to save his ailing brother.
 He told about the fire incident. 
Also, they have saved some patients.
He said, "Initially there was an explosion.
Another explosion came from the other side.
The fire was spreading like fuel.
The smoke reached my brother.
My brother is sick.
I took him on the road.
Then I went back.
The fire did not reach the last floor.
I saw a year old girl suffocating.
She would have died.
I carried her on my shoulders and carried her out.
People were jumping around.
Doctors were falling on the roofs of cars.
I went up again and brought people down. "
The fire started from the hospital's intensive care unit, Major General Kadim Bohan, the head of Iraq's civil defense department, told state media.
Some patients died due to the machine being pulled out of the hospital while others died due to suffocation.
Corona outbreak began in Iraq in February.
 So far, more than one million corona patients have been registered in the country.
According to the Iraqi Ministry of Health, more than one million people in the country have been infected with the corona so far.
 15,217 patients have died.
Iraq launched the corona vaccine last month and so far 6.5 million people in the country have been vaccinated.
Corona Vaccine: Can you get corona vaccine during menstruation?
From May 1, 2021, all people over the age of 18 will be vaccinated against corona. 
But before that, a message about menstruation was circulating and many people started asking questions about it. 
Many are confused. 
Seeing this, we asked the experts whether to get vaccinated during menstruation or not and got scientific information.
But did this question arise? So read this message circulating on social media - " Vaccination is starting for everyone over the age of 18 from a date.
When registering for vaccination, keep an eye on when menstruation occurs.
Do not get vaccinated five days before and five days after menstruation.
The immune system is weakened.
The first dose of the vaccine lowers your immune system and then gradually boosts your immune system.
So do not get vaccinated during menstruation. "
Over the last few days, this and similar messages have been circulating on WhatsApp as well as other messaging apps.
According to the new policy of the central government, all persons above the age of 18 years will be vaccinated. 
Registration will start for that.
In the first phase, doctors, nurses and medical staff were vaccinated.
 The senior citizens were then vaccinated. 
Vaccination was then opened to people over the age of 45.
Under the new policy, men and women between the ages of 18 and 45 will now be able to get vaccinated. 
After the announcement of this decision, messages saying don't get vaccinated during menstruation started circulating on social media.
'The vaccine does not harm your body'
Does Vaccination Affect Menstruation? Or we talked to Dr. Gayatri Deshpande about whether experts really say that you should not get vaccinated due to low immunity during menstruation.
Dr. Gayatri Deshpande is a Senior Consultant in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Nanavati Super Specialty Hospital.
Dr. Deshpande says, "Menstruation is a natural thing.
There should be no hindrance.
Get vaccinated whenever you have time.
Young girls will be out of the house for work because not everyone can work from home.
Many women work in essential services.
Menstruation may or may not start at any time.
They must be vaccinated if they are registered and receiving the vaccine. "
There is no fear that the vaccine will harm your body, said Dr. Gayatri Deshpande says.
What is the explanation given by the Government of India?
The Press Information Bureau issued a fact check after messages about menstruation and vaccination started circulating on social media.
It says that girls and women are being told not to get vaccinated five days before and five days after menstruation. 
Those messages are fake. 
Don't believe the rumors.
The vaccination campaign for everyone over the age of 18 is starting from 1st May. 
Registration for this is starting from April 28 on cowin.gov.in .
Does corona affect menstruation? BBC Marathi had earlier sought information from doctors in this regard.
Covid can change the menstrual cycle?
About 40 per cent of the total number of coronary patients in Maharashtra are women. 
So we tried to find out from gynecologists, does covid change women's menstrual cycle?
Speaking to the BBC, Fortis Hospital gynecologist Dr. Sonal Kumta says, "Complaints of irregular menstruation, late menstruation, change in bleeding pattern, excessive bleeding have been found in women who have been discharged from the corona."
According to experts, patients with coronary heart disease show other medical problems. 
So did Kovid change the shift? It is not possible to say for sure.
Speaking to the BBC about this, the former head of the gynecology department of Sir JJ Hospital, Dr. Ashok Anand says, "There are documented reports of swelling of the ovaries in women after covid.
These cases have been reported."
"If the ovaries are swollen after a corona infection, there is a chance of discomfort or changes during menstruation," said Dr. Happiness continues.
What is 'amenorrhea'?
According to Web-MD, 'amenorrhea' means no menstruation.
 If a woman has this problem, she will not have menstruation.
 This is not a disease.
 But, doctors should be informed about this.
Corona and menstruation?
Experts say there is no concrete evidence that corona has a direct effect on the menstrual cycle.
The gynecologist of Hiranandani Hospital, Dr. Manjiri Mehta says, "Menstrual changes cannot be directly linked to Covid-19.
There is still no evidence to show that corona infection affects menstruation."
Mumbai-based gynecologist Dr. No woman has come to Komal Chavan complaining of menstrual problems after he was released from the corona.
Speaking to the BBC, she said: "After a long-term illness, women's menstrual periods change.
Some have more or less bleeding.
"But it needs to be studied," he said. 
Komal has an opinion.
Changes in the female reproductive system after covid?
Corona infection weakens the body's immune system. 
Some suffer from lung problems.
 So, in some, other medical problems arise.
"Decreased immunity after covid is likely to weaken the reproductive system."
That's what Dr. Fortis Hospital. 
Sonal Kumta says.
What should women do?
According to gynecologists, women should take care of themselves.
Proper diet, exercise is essential
The body should relax at the right time
Sleep should be on time
Don't sit and work too long.
 Take a break from work.
After the Covid-19 infection, the body gradually recovers. 
So the menstrual cycle will gradually return to normal, said Dr. Says Kumta.
Did women have menstrual problems in the lockdown?
Dr. Manjiri adds, "Women with PCOD (Polycystic Ovarian Disease) did not exercise during the lockdown.
Eating and drinking times changed as they worked from home.
Eating more junk food increased the risk of weight gain.
Corona: 20 covid positive patients passed through the isolation center
Twenty corona positive patients have escaped from the isolation center ITI College, an industrial training institute at Ghatanji in Yavatmal district. 
All of them were admitted to the center at around 8.30 am yesterday after testing positive for corona.
These people will be brought back to the center, said Health Officer Dharmesh Chavan.
"The fugitives are villagers.
They may have returned from the center out of fear or because they feel nothing has happened.
We will bring them back tomorrow," said Dharmesh Chavan, taluka health officer of Ghatanji taluka.
Around noon on April 24, 20 patients were discharged from the isolation ward. 
It is learned that 65 Corona patients were admitted to the Industrial Training Institute at Ghatanji. 
Of those, 20 corona patients are known to have escaped.
Finding out how many people they have met in the meantime will also be a big headache for the administration.
Corona virus: How will this 'make the chain' break?
About one o'clock in the afternoon.
 In the scorching sun, a Maruti Omni Ambulance came to a halt at the door of the hospital. 
Four or five young men jumped out of it and began searching for a doctor at the hospital.
A very serious patient was in that car. 
He seemed to be having trouble breathing. 
Moments later the doctor examined him and advised him to be taken to the next major hospital. 
The next minute the whole congregation got in the car and moved on.
This is a daily routine for the staff of Covid Hospital.
They don't feel it anymore. 
 Most of them have taken both vaccines.
 But for a man like me, that picture was new.
On the one hand, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and his entire government are saying 'break the chain - break the chain'. 
For this, ninth rules are being issued every day and on the other hand, a picture of 'Make the Chain' is being formed against it.
I have to go to Covid Hospital every day for the treatment of my family members. 
But seeing the picture there creates fear in the mind. 
At least 3 relatives are following them to admit a patient.
The whole family had come to see a grandfather in the hospital.
 Not all well-to-do relatives follow Covid's rules. 
Often these stressful relatives do not realize that we are with a patient who has covid or its symptoms.
Isn't it necessary for relatives to come? If asked, the answer is no. 
The reason is that if a patient is admitted and his condition is serious, then at least 3 relatives have to run after him. 
He has the same reasons.
1) Finding Remedicivir (Although it is supplied directly to hospitals, it is insufficient.)
2) Facilitate Plasma (For this, at least 2 donors have to be found and taken to the Plasma Bank.)
3) If the hospital runs out of oxygen by mistake, rush to find an oxygen concentrator.
4) Purchase of daily necessities and other necessities.
These are unavoidable reasons. 
And getting all of this is a test for the patient's relatives. 
It takes an exact amount of money, time and effort to pass this test. 
But the biggest test is the doctors, nurses and other staff working in the hospital.
The patients and their relatives are cared for by their noses. 
This is the subject of a separate article.
 This stressful congregation is often unable to go with each patient for other checkups.
In such cases, the relatives of the patients have to take their patients. 
Even with the idea that you are going with a covid patient, many have no cure.
This is the same group of relatives who take patients to the hospital, help them, sometimes visit patients in the ICU without the doctor's notice (yes it is true).
Young relatives meet other friends without ever wearing a mask in the hope that nothing will happen to them.
 Go to the nose and chat with friends.
We don't think we've been exposed to the corona in a lot of places, or we don't have the seriousness of it.
Strict lockdown was imposed during the first wave of the corona. 
At that time, people were following the rules for fear of the police. 
Now there is strong opposition to the strict lockdown from different levels.
As a result, the government also avoided a strict lockdown. 
But how much do the working class or the merchant class and the traders who oppose this lockdown follow the rules laid down by the government?
Still some vendors, merchants or working class are unconcerned about masks. 
People also seem unconcerned about masks, sanitizers, proper distance.
The government has allowed the shops to continue till a certain time, but the shops are being kept open till the municipal vehicle arrives to close the shops. 
When the municipal vehicle arrives, the peddlers start running away.
On the one hand, the number of new corona patients in the state is approaching 50,000 every day. 
There are queues of patients in every small hospital.
Medical shops are getting crowded to take medicines. 
Everyone in the acquaintance or relationship has died of cowardice or someone is very serious. 
Everyone talks about it.
And on the other hand, this is the picture.
Fear of the corona seems to be waning in people's minds. 
The people in the buildings where Corona's patient was found in the first wave were overwhelmed.
Now, however, citizens are seen living in the buildings where Corona's patients were found. 
In societies, 50 per cent of men and women who go out for night raids do not wear a mask. 
The ones that are planted are under the nose.
Well these churches are watching the news on TV every day about how serious the situation has become. 
The words break the chain, break the chain are somehow falling on their ears.
Many such examples and observations can be given. 
But the need is not to frighten Corona, but to take her seriously.
Mann Ki Baat-Narendra Modi: 'Corona is testing the patience of all of us'
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Mann Ki Baat program for the month of April will be telecast today. 
A second wave of corona is sweeping across the country.
More than 3 lakh corona patients are found in the country every day. 
The current picture is that the stress of this situation is coming on the health system.
There are reports of shortages of oxygen, beds, ventilators and remedicivir from all parts of the country.
Against this backdrop, it is important to see what issues Narendra Modi discusses in this year's Mann Ki Baat.
Narendra Modi had said at the time that lockdown should be the last resort.
Last week, on April 20, Narendra Modi addressed the nation. 
Meanwhile, Modi also appealed that Kumbh Mela should be celebrated in a formal manner on the backdrop of Corona. 
He also canceled his visit to West Bengal and held a meeting with the Chief Minister.
Seeing all these developments, everyone is paying attention to Narendra Modi's mind.
Significance depends on the size of the problem
Corona is watching your test. 
Your men have left prematurely. 
In the first wave we defeated Corona.
 But in the second wave, he is bothering us.
I had discussions with experts in various fields. 
He made several suggestions.
 Various state governments, including the Center, are contributing. 
Health workers are fighting tirelessly.
Dr. What did Shashank Joshi say?
Member of Maharashtra Task Force Dr. Mann Ki Baat. Shashank Joshi interacted with the Prime Minister. 
The second wave is fast approaching.
Mortality is low.
Young children are also showing symptoms.
Taste and odor are also symptoms.
Eighty percent of people have no symptoms at all.
Mutations occur.
As we change clothes, the virus takes on a different form, he said.
Mild symptoms, moderate to severe symptoms. 
Check for fever, oxygen and pulse for mild symptoms. 
Paracetamol should be taken on the advice of a doctor. 
Consult a doctor for moderate symptoms.  
There are small solutions.
Remedesivir is an experimental drug.
This can reduce hospital stay. 
This medicine is only for those who need oxygen. 
Pranayama, lung exercises can help. 
The best treatments in the world are available in the country. 
The recovery rate is good.

4. Nine thousand metric tons of oxygen sent abroad - Chhagan Bhujbal
There is a shortage of oxygen in the country and many hospitals are dying due to lack of oxygen. 
Despite this situation, Food and Civil Supplies Minister Chhagan Bhujbal has alleged that 9,000 metric tonnes of oxygen was sent abroad from the country.
Oxygen deficiency is present in all the states.
Many coronary heart disease patients have lost their lives due to lack of oxygen. 
 In such a case, if oxygen is being sent abroad from here, then the matter is serious.

Corona virus: Why is it necessary to take care even after recovering from covid?
So far, millions of people in India have successfully overcome Kovid-19.
 People have conquered corona on the strength of timely diagnosis, medication and positive attitude.
After winning the battle against Covid-19, the real battle begins to unleash life. 
To rise again with new hope. 
That is why it is important to maintain good mental health along with physical health.
There has been an increase in cases of lung injury in patients who have been deprived of corona for a longer period of time on oxygen and ventilators. 
These patients have started having problems like shortness of breath and shortness of breath. 
Therefore, some covid-free patients in Mumbai had to be put on oxygen again.
According to doctors, getting rid of corona does not mean that you cannot be careless. 
Coronation survivors should take special care of themselves.
What should covid-free patients take care of?
According to the World Health Organization, it is normal to experience shortness of breath and loss of strength due to illness. 
This makes it very difficult to breathe.
So the following things need to be done-
1) Sleep on the left side while sleeping. 
Take a pillow under the head to support the head and neck. 
The legs should be slightly bent at the knees.
2) If you have difficulty breathing while sitting at the table, bend forward from the waist and place your head and neck on the pillow placed on the table. 
Hands should be placed comfortably on the table. 
Even if you don't take a pillow, it will work.
3) In case of discomfort while sitting on a chair, bend forward a little and place your hands on your thighs
How to breathe?
Sit quietly in one place. 
Keep one hand on the chest and the other on the abdomen, close the eyes and sit quietly. 
Inhale slowly through the nose and release through the mouth. 
If nasal breathing is obstructed, breathe through the mouth. 
Try to breathe as slowly as possible.
Exercises to do after coming home from the hospital
Exercise reduces the difficulty in breathing. 
Helps to strengthen muscles. 
Reduces stress. 
Confidence grows. 
If you are on oxygen in the hospital, keep someone with you during exercise. 
Inform your doctor immediately if you experience any discomfort while exercising.
So Pay Exercise - Roll the shoulders back and forth. 
Slightly bend to the left and right while standing or sitting on a chair. 
Try to bend the legs at the knees. 
This is called 'warm up'.
A little hard exercise - try to walk in space. 
When walking outside, walk on a flat land. 
Gradually increase walking speed and distance.
Post-covid OPD in hospitals
Long-term exposure to oxygen and ventilators has increased the incidence of lung disease in patients who have been freed of Covid-19. 
Post-covid OPD has been started for such patients at KEM, Fortis, St. George and other hospitals in Mumbai.
Speaking to the BBC about what to take care of those who have been freed from covid, the General Physician of St. George's Hospital, Dr. Rahul Darnule says, "Corona virus reduces the efficiency of the lungs.
Therefore, breathing exercises, pranayama, short brisk walking are very important to increase the lung function of covid-free patients.
The incidence of lung scarring has increased in those who have been released from the corona. 
Therefore, rehabilitation program is very important for the patients who have lung injury after healing with corona. 
Rahul has an opinion.
"Post-covid OPD has been started at St. George's Hospital.
In this OPD, patients are called for follow-up and their chest is CT-scanned.
They are taught breathing exercises and patients are told to do these exercises daily after going home," he said. 
Rahul further said.
Even if the covid is released, it should not be left out
Speaking to the BBC, a chest and lung specialist from Mumbai's Zen Multispeciality Hospital, Dr. Arvind Kate said, "It is important to take care of covid-free patients even after they go home.
Coronum-free patients cannot rule out the possibility of re-infection.
In addition, you need to take vitamin-C tablets. "
"Drink hot water while eating.
Eat a nutritious diet.
Oxygen levels in the body should be checked regularly.
If you feel any discomfort, you should contact a doctor immediately," said Dr. Said Kate.
Covid-19 and results
Speaking to the BBC about the importance of rehabilitation for coroners, Dr. Rahul Pandit says, "Significant changes have been found in patients struggling with Kovid-19 such as intolerance to exercise stress, poor sleep schedule, muscle loss, and loss of appetite.
"It is very important to re-evaluate the existing disease.
What was the severity of the disease before covid-19 and what was the effect after covid-19?
It needs to be monitored. " 
Asam Dr. Pandit said.
How to get rid of stress, anxiety and depression
According to experts, even if the patient is free of covid, he is constantly scared. 
The stress of what society will say and how it will behave is very much on that person. 
Therefore, people should pay attention to mental health as well as physical health.
Talking to BBC about this, psychiatrist Dr. Sagar Mundada says, "Sometimes a covine-free patient is traumatized by the mistreatment of society.
There is a risk of anger.
Therefore, corona-free patients should think positively.
People should be mentally prepared for what they will say.
Post Covid Care is not very difficult if it is mental preparation. "
After Kovid, most of the patients are alone at home.
In such cases, thoughts come to their minds.
So people should do mindful meditation for 10 minutes.
It will not cause mental exhaustion.
Medications will help alleviate this anxiety, "said Dr. Called Mundada.
How to maintain good mental health?
According to the World Health Organization, managing post-illness stress, anxiety and depression is also an important step in recovering from an illness. For this,
Covid-free patients should get enough sleep.
 Eat a healthy, proper and nutritious diet. 
Stay active which helps in reducing stress. 
Talk to people, listen to songs to calm your mind, read.
Brain exercises should be done to help increase memory.
The importance of physiotherapy after covid
Covid-19 infection reduces the mobility of some individuals, especially the elderly. 
Physiotherapy is very important in the rehabilitation of such patients.
Talking to BBC about this, physiotherapist from Pune Dr. Mansi Pawar says, "Chest physiotherapy is very important for patients who have been on covid-19 for a long time.
These patients cannot exercise immediately after recovery due to poor mobility.
Chest physiotherapy helps to clear the lungs.
Physiotherapy gradually strengthens the muscles. "
"Therefore, Covid-19-free patients should do breathing exercises first.
Exercise should be started slowly after the lung function increases.
However, one should take someone with him or consult a doctor while exercising," said Dr. Says Mansi.
Corona: How are tired doctors working without sleeping in such an environment of screaming, screaming, hooting?
Diabetes doctor Rahul Bakshi was on a round of covid wards at the Bombay Hospital in July. 
Then they saw an employee wearing a PPE kit sitting in front of a table fan in a room. 
He must have been taking a break from his eight-hour Covid Ward duty.
Steroids prescribed for the treatment of covidia increase the amount of sugar in patients.
 Therefore, Dr. The role of a diabetes specialist like Bakshi is important for patients.
Doctors usually don't keep their phones with them during rounds of covid wards. 
So Dr. Bakshi picked up the phone of a junior doctor working in the nursing station and snapped a photo of a colleague resting in front of the fan.
PPE stands for Personal Protective Equipment N-95 Mask, Surgical Mask, Goggles, Face Shield, Gown, Cap.
Wearing a PPE kit means not eating, not drinking water. 
Can't go to natural rituals, can't take any help from anyone.
What if you were asked to work on a kit for a few months? What will happen to you
Fear of wearing a PPE kit
Dr. on Instagram account. Bakshi wrote under the photo, "I had to soak in sweat for half an hour after wearing the PPE kit because you are packed from head to toe.
The problems are even greater for doctors, nurses, ward helpers, lab assistants, radiology staff, cleaners and others moving from one ward to another.
If you walk a hundred meters wearing a PPE kit, you will catch your breath. 
It was difficult to breathe if I went up two floors. "
Dr. Bakshi writes, "When a man wears a PPE kit and sits in front of the fan, the fan makes a loud noise.
But its air does not reach us.
We do not know it even though there is strong wind outside.
Working in such a situation also has psychological consequences."
Over the past year, millions of doctors, medical staff have been dealing with the corona crisis in challenging situations.
Bhagyalakshmi, a resident doctor in Mumbai, says, "For the first time in my life, many people have to refuse because of the second wave of covid.
Patients' relatives are looking for ventilators and oxygen beds. "
Death of a doctor
According to official figures, the Corona crisis has so far killed 1.87 lakh people in the country. 
President and Professor of the Indian Medical Association Dr. J. A. According to Jayalal, 780 doctors have died of corona so far.
Corona does not count the number of deaths of nurses, medical professionals.
For the last thirteen months, doctors have been working in the medical field despite the problems at home, the increasing pressure of work, the constant deaths around, the fear.
Dr. Bhagyalakshmi says, "We have been working in a stressful environment for a long time.
We are frustrated."
Dr. Bhagyalakshmi often has to work for 10 hours with a PPE kit.
Depressing atmosphere
According to Suhail Nayak, a pediatrician in Baramulla, Kashmir, it is very difficult to work in such an environment. 
When there is so much mental oppression on you, there is a corona all around and only the corona, there is a situation where people cannot breathe.
According to Rohit Joshi, a resident doctor in Mumbai, it is frustrating to work in such an environment. 
Do you sometimes feel that way? Give up.
Resident doctors are on duty 24 hours a day as compared to senior doctors and consultants.
Working in the ward of Kovid patients wearing PPE kits for ten hours a day for many days, not being able to help people even if they want to, calling for duty at any time of the night, not getting enough sleep, stressful environment from morning to evening, working unhealthily, deaths all around, Working in an environment where crying, weeping, and weeping can be overwhelming.
Dr. Rohit Joshi says, "The number of patients is huge, the number of doctors is low.
We have to work fast.
One patient cannot be given more than fifteen to twenty minutes.
It is not just the number of covid patients that is increasing. 
People with covid negatives are sent to non-covid wards. 
The number of patients is increasing there as well. "
How long is all this?
In the second wave of covid, there is a shortage of oxygen, hospital beds, medicines, injections. 
The doctor's question is how long will all this last?
"If this continues, we will not be able to stay away from our families," said a female health worker who works away from her family in Bhagalpur, Bihar.
Citizens clapped and clapped for people working in the medical field. 
Doctors and congregations working in the medical field are urging people to wear masks, keep a distance and wash their hands regularly.
"We were risking our lives," says Amandeep Kaur, a gynecologist in Jammu. 
Now we are risking the lives of our families.
Amandeep's parents, who work at a government hospital in Gandhinagar, Jammu, are over 60 years old. 
His mother suffers from diabetes. 
So he has stopped visiting his mother.
Amandeep also had a corona during surgery on a woman who was infected with covid in August.
Dr. Amandeep says, "Ten covid positive patients underwent caesarean section in August.
Their children were negative.
That's when I came to believe that God is with us."
Jammu was the only hospital in Kovid to deliver positive women.
After each surgery she would take a bath and then move on to the next task.
People from Poonch, Rajouri, Kishtwar, Doda coming to their hospital. 
Amandeep used to perform two to three surgeries daily.
During the lockdown, she would drive to the hospital for surgery. 
The atmosphere at that time, the pressure of work, the distance from everyone after work all affected his little boy. 
Amandeep had to discuss with his teachers.
He also felt dizzy while undergoing surgery wearing a PPE kit. 
He said that he would sit for a while and then go back to work.
Adding PPE does not avert the danger
After applying the PPE kit, there is a sweat bath. 
Salt and water are excreted from the body. 
In such cases you cannot remove the mask.
Wearing a PPE kit does not mean that there is no danger. 
Amandeep and his colleagues have been corona.
Doctors and their colleagues in the Covid ward are working in an environment with a huge viral load.
Through coughing and sneezing, the virus accumulates in the air droplets and also travels to the PPE kit.
The outer part of the mask may contain the corona virus.
PPE is a method of kit removal. 
Gowns, goggles have to be removed in a certain order. 
This is because aerosols and particles stay in the same room when removing the PPE kit.
Dr. Amandeep's husband Dr. According to Sandeep Dogra, even after wearing a PPE kit in the first wave of corona, the doctors got corona because, after leaving the ward, they felt that nothing would happen now. 
You should not remove the mask in the room. 
This story was not known then. 
Now it is slowly beginning to be noticed.
Family worries
Given the rapid rate at which corona infections are spreading, doctors fear that their families may not be affected.
Motihari's surgeon Dr. Ashutosh Sharan says, "After coming out of the OPD, he removes the gloves by singing.
He sanitizes himself.
He takes a bath with hot water when he goes home.
Only then he meets his family."
Dr. Sharan has his own nursing home.
They have been vaccinated.
  However, your grandchildren and staff are very careful not to become corona.
The 65-year-old Sharan's day starts at nine in the morning and ends at ten at night.
He had gone to Siliguri only once in the last 13-14 months for his grandson’s birthday.
 This was possible because the number of corona patients had decreased in December and January.
Dr. Mumbai. Joshi thinks, "A lot of people have no idea what conditions doctors have to work in.
According to them, it is a matter of money for doctors to prescribe injections on remediation.
Or is it an attempt to boil down the money of Covid Hospital.
I can't change people.
But there are a lot of people who make us look good.
They give us courage and strength to work.
Maharashtra Corona: 'One person dies in our village every day for last 15 days'
"For the last 15 days, one person has been dying from corona in our village every day.
There are currently around 500 corona patients in the village." - Satish Ugle, Dodi Budruk
This is the situation at present in Dodi Budruk village in Sinnar taluka of Nashik district.
The second wave of corona has caused havoc in Maharashtra. 
The corona virus, which previously spread to urban areas, is now beginning to take over rural areas. 
The increasing number of corona patients in villages is indicative of this. 
This is a review of the situation in the rural areas of the state while there is a lot of discussion about the shortage of health services in Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur.
The number of corona patients in Dodi Budruk has been increasing rapidly for the last 15 days. 
But not only the number of patients but also the number of deaths has increased.
To curb this, the villagers of Dodi Budruk are planning to set up a covid care center in the village itself.
"Corona's death rate in our village is very high.
So we discussed the WhatsApp group and now the villagers are planning to set up a few-bed covid care center in the village.
But, doctors, nurses and others for this center.
There is a rural hospital in Dodi Budruk with a population of about 7,000. 
But the villagers complain that the facilities are not being provided as they are for the entire taluka.
As a result, corona positive patients are being quarantined in their own homes.
Fear of the hospital
When asked what is on the minds of the villagers about corona, Satish says, "Everyone knows that if you test corona and come back positive, you will not get a bed.
So you don't want to be tested and you have to take pains.
People are wondering where to get Rs 2 lakh from. "
Additional District Surgeon of Nashik Dr. Nikhil Shendane from the district says, "The number of corona patients has increased so much that the number of doctors is dwindling.
In this situation, everything should not be pushed on the administration.
People should follow the rules, be aware.
Corona has millions of patients, so not everyone can get a bed. "
The death toll has also risen in the village of Shrikant Waghmare, a resident of Harbal in Nanded district.
He says, "The atmosphere in the village is very bad.
At least 2 patients will be found at home.
People do not go to the hospital out of fear.
In our village of 3000 population, 20 deaths have been reported so far in a month due to various diseases."
Adinath Gadhe observes that people have become more aware due to the increase in deaths in villages.
Adinath of Guha village in Ahmednagar district says, "Now there are corona patients in the settlement.
So people are now wearing face masks even if they want to go to mow the grass in the fields.
The death toll in the village has increased, this is the result."
'Rs 4000 for 7 kms'
Grandmother and elder uncle of Sudhir Kakade of Khopeshwar Bolthan village in Gangapur taluka of Aurangabad district have passed away due to corona. 
Now his younger uncle is admitted in the government hospital in Aurangabad.
He told the BBC: "We have 30 to 40 houses in our village.
The village is small.
There is a Gatgram Panchayat.
There is no hospital in the village.
So I tested my uncle's corona at Wadgaon, 4 km from the village.
She tested positive.
They had to be brought to Aurangabad as it was difficult to take them.
"A private ambulance took Rs 4,000 for the 7 km distance from MGM to Ghati (Government Hospital).
Uncle was afraid to be judged in a simple car, so we took him by ambulance.
An ambulance took Rs 17,000 to bring his elder uncle from Ahmednagar to Aurangabad."
The distance from Ahmednagar to Aurangabad is 115 km.
Local journalists also told the BBC that the high cost of ambulances was a major problem in Aurangabad.
Asked about the rates of ambulances, Aurangabad Divisional Commissioner Sunil Kendrakar said, "Most of the smart city buses are deployed as ambulances in Aurangabad.
Apart from this, the hospitals do not charge their own ambulances.
What is the state government doing?
We tried to contact the Minister of Health and the Minister of State for Health to find out exactly what the government is doing about the shortage of beds in rural areas and the rates of private ambulances. 
But no contact has been made yet.
Health Minister Rajesh Tope , meanwhile , had said last year that if the ambulance charged more than the stipulated rate, the license would be revoked and a case would be filed against it.
He also directed to increase the number of beds in government health institutions in view of the increasing number of corona patients in the state.
America finally heard! Corona will supply raw materials for vaccine production
With the second wave of corona in India, the health system has gone through Kollam. 
Therefore, the demand for speedy vaccination is increasing.
 Therefore, the central government has announced to vaccinate everyone above 18 years of age from May 1. 
However, the lack of raw material for vaccine production caused problems. 
Vaccine production was affected by the US intervention. 
Since then, India has repeatedly demanded raw materials from the US. 
After all, the US has agreed to supply raw materials to India for vaccine production. 
This information has been given to India by the Biden administration. 
US Security Adviser Jake Sullivan briefed India's Security Adviser Ajit Doval.
 So once again the emphasis is on vaccine production.
A few days back, Adar Punawala, CEO of Siram Institute, had informed that there was a shortage of raw material for the manufacture of vaccines. 
He said the United States and Europe had cut off supplies.
 Adar Punawala had now joined hands directly with US President Joe Biden as raw materials were still not being supplied. 
After that, the pressure on the US was mounting. 
The US has finally agreed to India's demand and will soon supply raw materials for vaccine production.
 This will eliminate the problem of vaccine production.
The Serum Institute is co-producing the Covishield vaccine with Astrazeneca and Oxford. 
At present, the production of 6 to 6.5 crore doses per month is underway at the Pune serum plant and the target of increasing it to 10 to 11 crore is expected by June this year, said Adar Poonawala.
There was a terrible wave of corona in America last year.
 At that time, India had sent hydrochloricquin from India to America. 
At that time, former US President Donald Trump had made a request to India. 
India had supplied crores of bullets in response to the urgent request.

The state government has imposed a strict lockdown till May 1 to control the rising corona outbreak in the state. 
Among other measures, the state government is also focusing on vaccination programs. The state on Saturday decided to issue a global tender to make more vaccines available so that there is no shortage of vaccines at vaccination centers from May 1. 
However, will people between the ages of 18 and 45 get free vaccines? Such a question was being asked.
 Finally, the state government announced that it will provide free vaccinations to citizens of this age group.
Britain also helps India in the fight against Corona
More than 600 medical devices have been sent
India is currently experiencing the second wave of the Corona epidemic. 
India is fighting with all its might against the Corona.
 But with millions of coronaries increasing every day, the burden on the health system has grown enormously. 
In many places, hospitals are short of beds, oxygen, ventilators, remedicivir injections, vaccines, etc. 
As a result, patients are suffering.
 In such a situation, many countries around the world have come forward to help India. 
It is against this backdrop that Britain has also taken on the role of helping India in its fight against the Corona.
The UK today (Sunday) announced that it was sending more than 600 medical devices to India. 
These devices also include oxygen concentrators and ventilators. 
Britain has said the move is to help India in its fight against the Corona.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson has said, "We stand with India as a friend and as an ally in the fight against Corona. 
We will continue to work with the Government of India during this time of crisis. ”
The United States, France, Europe, Australia, China, Pakistan, Singapore and the UAE have so far announced policies to help India and have taken active initiatives. 
Corona is spreading rapidly in India and these countries are promising all possible help. 
Therefore, the tone is that India can get help in fighting the war against the Corona.
Health department proposes to import 25,000 metric tonnes of oxygen!
10 lakh for remediation, Rs 743 crore plan
The central government has warned that there are about 70,000 active corona patients in Maharashtra and the number could increase to 99,000 by the end of April.
In addition, 10 lakh Remedacivir injections will be procured. 
About Rs 743 crore 72 lakh will be spent for this.
Although the state produces 1,200 metric tonnes of oxygen, it currently consumes 1,550 metric tonnes of oxygen per day for corona patients and 400 metric tonnes of oxygen is procured from other states. 
However the number of corona patients is increasing rapidly in many states of the country. 
As this includes the states that supply oxygen to Maharashtra, it is likely that these states will not be able to supply oxygen in the near future, and in view of the growing number of patients, additional oxygen beds will have to be set up. Apart from importing oxygen, Pradeep Vyas plans to set up a new oxygen plant, arrange an oxygen concentrator next to the patient's bed and purchase a tanker for oxygen storage and transportation.
Apart from this, considering the shortage and need of remedicivir, an urgent proposal for purchase of 10 lakh remedicivir has been prepared and sent to the State High Authority Committee for approval. 
The proposal is worth Rs 743.72 crore and will be spent from the state disaster fund. 
The proposal, submitted by the health department on April 24, seeks permission to import 25,000 metric tonnes of oxygen at a rate of 500 metric tonnes per day at an estimated cost of Rs 100 crore.
Last week, Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte had a meeting with Dr Pradeep Vyas, Principal Secretary, Health Department and others concerned regarding the import of oxygen. 
However, the decision was not taken as Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that the Center would import oxygen from abroad. 
Two days ago, the Policy Commission and the Union Ministry of Health instructed the states to prepare for the review of the number of patients in various states of the country by the end of April 30 and how many beds, intensive care units and oxygen beds will be required. 
According to the information received from the central government, the state is expected to have 99,665 patients by the end of April 30, 16,061 oxygen beds will be reduced in the isolation ward, 2,877 beds in the intensive care unit and 1,450 ventilator beds. 
The state government can arrange the beds but the question of where the oxygen will come from was raised at a meeting of high-ranking officials. 
After that, Principal Secretary Dr. Pradeep Vyas has immediately prepared a proposal to import oxygen and set up an oxygen plant and purchase a tanker and submitted it to the State High Commission for approval.
According to the proposal, 132 Pressure Swing Adaptation Plants (PSAs) will be set up in 132 hospitals. 
The project is worth Rs 200 crore 80 lakh and will produce 600 to 3500 liters of oxygen per minute. 
The scheme will be implemented in 23 district hospitals, 8 general hospitals, 91 sub-district hospitals and 10 municipal hospitals of the health department. 
In addition, 40,701 oxygen concentrators will be procured for use in patient bedside. 
An oxygen concentrator produces a jumbo cylinder of oxygen in 24 hours, a senior health official said. 
The project will cost Rs 272.12 crore and 21 ISO tankers worth about Rs 40 lakh will be procured for Thane, Nashik, Pune, Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Latur and Nagpur. 
Considering the gap between the growing demand for remedicivir in the state and the supply from the center, 10 lakh remedicivir will be procured at a rate of Rs. 
As a result, there will no longer be a shortage of remedicivir for a month, health department sources said.
Towards patient stabilization
Although the number of patients has decreased in the last 15 days, the number of deaths has increased.

BJP took aim at the decision in Chandrapur district
The Thackeray government on Thursday decided to lift the liquor ban in Chandrapur district.
In April 2015, the BJP government had decided to ban alcohol in Chandrapur district due to demands from social workers and the rate of mass agitation.

ban lifted, exam ban maintained.
Drug dealers' concern for
women's safety
Milk producers,
however, are encouraged to drink alcohol
The leaders of the alliance,
however, are intoxicated with power and are unconscious
The Thackeray government must have felt that the anti-Koran 'spirit' should be nurtured, ”Upadhyay said.
MLA Sudhir Muntiwar had promised that if a BJP-Shiv Sena coalition government comes to power in the state, we will take a decision to ban alcohol in the district.

Children with type 1 diabetes are at risk for mycorrhizae
Children with coronary heart disease need to be mentally strong.
Aurangabad: Children with type 1 diabetes who are not producing insulin in their body are at risk of mucormycosis, which has made the parents of such children uneasy. The number of diabetic children is also significant in rural areas and as there is no survey plan for it, statistics are not available with the administration. Therefore, finding children with diabetes in the background of the third wave is also a challenge for the administration.
There are two types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 2 diabetes is found in adults and type 1 diabetes in children. In Marathwada, there are 900 children with type 1 diabetes registered under Udan Sanstha. This number can be as high as two thousand. In India, 1.5 lakh children are reported to be in type-1, said Dr. Archana Sarda said.
Children with coronary heart disease need to be mentally strong. Children play on mobile phones. Children are urged by parents to study. Often children do not listen. Corona can't even go outside because of the situation. It was irritating. Children also complain about their parents by calling the doctor who treats them. Therefore, it is necessary to give mental support to the children, the parents have to understand that Dr. Said Sarda.
The third wave of corona is a danger to children and parents should check their blood sugar levels regularly to avoid becoming infected. At home, children can be cared for by focusing on sunbathing, jumping rope and exercising.
Out of 900 children registered under the flight, 20 have been coroned so far. However, due to timely treatment, they are now coronary free. If a diabetic child or their parent develops a cold, fever or any other symptoms, they should immediately contact a doctor and seek treatment at a hospital without getting sick, says Dr. Sarda.
The survey program for children with diabetes is not yet on the administration's agenda. When asked about that background, Deputy Director of Health Dr. Swapnil Lale said that no scheme for the survey of diabetic children is being implemented at the village level at present. However, information is sought about older people with diabetes. Prasad Mirkale, Deputy Chief Executive, Women and Child Welfare Department, Aurangabad Zilla Parishad, also said that the office was not instructed to seek information about children with diabetes.
Anxiety of adults more than children
Children with type 1 diabetes have not yet developed symptoms of mucorrhoea. However, they are in danger. As many as 20 diabetic children have died during the flight. Now they are cool. Type 2 diabetic patients in adults also have many other ailments and their families are worried about their health. With timely care of children, coronary heart disease can be completely cured. A proposal has been put before the health minister and officials to find out the number of children with diabetes and keep their statistics with the administration. Work has stopped due to Corona since last year.

Deaths of coroners due to inactivity of district administration
While the death toll in Vidarbha is declining everywhere, the death toll in the district is 'as it was', which is a matter of concern.
Letter of former MP from Chandrapur Naresh Puglia to the Chief Minister
 Demand for a high level inquiry
Chandrapur: Due to inactivity of Guardian Minister Vijay Vadettiwar and district administration, the highest number of 1,275 deaths of corona is in Nagpur division after Nagpur district. Lack of oxygen, lack of ventilator beds, shortage of medicines, shortage of doctors and medical staff, refusal to increase the salaries of doctors and staff despite having the right to appoint, result in twenty to thirty crore deaths every day. A high-level inquiry should be held into all these deaths. This is a very serious and frightening issue, so pay attention in time, otherwise the situation will get out of hand and the people will get angry, warned senior Congress leader and former MP Naresh Puglia to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Pradesh Congress. A letter has been written to the chairman of the committee Nana Patole.
While the death toll in Vidarbha is declining everywhere, the death toll in the district is 'as it was', which is a matter of concern. Government hospitals, primary health centers lack health facilities. That is why the number of deaths is increasing. Puglia has demanded a high-level inquiry into the reasons behind the non-appointment of doctors and other medical personnel, even though the Mineral Development Fund is a huge amount of money and the district administration has the authority to spend 30 per cent of the expenditure from the district planning fund.
Zilla Parishad Chief Executive Officer Rahul Kardile has requested the officers and staff to appoint five MD doctors from one day's salary, pay them Rs one lakh, then why can't Guardian Minister Vijay Vadettiwar take the same decision.
The World Health Organization and the central and state governments have warned of a third wave. The district administration is expected to make proper planning for this. The affidavit has been given by the Collector, District Surgeon, Superintendent and Commissioner in the High Court. Puglia also said that doctors and medical staff should be paid more to serve them, provide medicines and other supplies to patients, and save patients' lives.
The Prime Minister will review the district on May 20. Considering the seriousness of this, the Chief Minister should pay attention to the problems of this district.

Fighting at a wedding in Corona
The number of people injured in the clashes has not been released yet.
Vasai: It has come to light that two groups clashed while dancing in a turmeric ceremony at Sakwar Patilpada in Vasai East. Despite the government's ban on wedding ceremonies during the Coronation period, large crowds of citizens have been surprised.
The wedding of Sunil Tumbada of Tumbada family was held on Sunday 16th May at Patilpada of Sakwar village in Vasai East. The wedding ceremony was preceded by a yellow ceremony the day before. This turmeric event was crowded with hundreds of visiting congregations. While the citizens present in Haldi were dancing at this time, some of these dancers were in a state of intoxication. After midnight, there was an argument between the dancers. This argument turned into a fight. Many were running after each other, while others were beating each other. Some threw chairs at each other.
The number of people injured in the clashes is yet to be ascertained. The kind of video that is currently being beaten is spreading everywhere.
As per the rules of the government, the wedding has been attended by 25 people and a time of two hours has been fixed. But this incident has shown that the government's restrictive rules have been literally trampled on. The question is how such a large number of citizens attended when only a few people were allowed. A case has been registered at Virar police station, Virar police said.
A case has been registered at Virar police station for violating Karona rules. Also, nine people involved in the case have been arrested so far. - Suresh Varade, Senior Inspector of Police, Virar Police, Thane
"It's a pleasure to have a vaccine project anywhere"; Ajit Pawar pierces BJP MLA's ear
High Court orders allotment of land in Pune to Bharat Biotech
While the Corona crisis is raging in the country and the state, there is a rift between the ruling party and the opposition in the state. Now that Bharat Biotech has chosen a site in Pune for vaccine production, allegations are rife. BJP MLA Krishna Khopade has alleged that Bharat Biotech project was hijacked in Pune. Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar has given a blunt answer and refuted the allegations.
"The Mumbai High Court has ordered the allotment of land at Manjari in Haveli taluka of Pune to Bharat Biotech for a corona vaccine project. As the Guardian Minister of Pune District, I have fulfilled my responsibility to ensure that the orders of the High Court are complied with. I would have been happy if Bharat Biotech's vaccine manufacturing project had taken place anywhere in the state including Pune and Nagpur. Therefore, the allegation of BJP MLA Krishna Khopade that 'Bharat Biotech project was hijacked by Ajit Pawar in Pune' is totally false, misleading to the people, an apologetic attempt to create a political sensation for the publicity of Aut Ghatke, 'replied Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar.
Bharat Biotech Vaccine Manufacturer had demanded a site for a vaccine plant in Pune. For this, Bharat Biotech has set up the closed Intervet India Pvt. Ltd. at Manjari. The company had proposed to the state government to get the land. Bharat Biotech moved the High Court seeking an immediate decision on the proposal. The High Court, in view of the crisis in Corona and the need for vaccine production, has directed to start Bharat Biotech project at Manjari in Haveli taluka of Pune, he added.
"The whole of Maharashtra is fighting in unity against Corona. The whole of Maharashtra is one from Chandya to Bandya and the Mahavikas Aghadi government is committed to the industrial, economic and infrastructural development of every district and division of the state. The Deputy Chief Minister has appealed to the opposition to stop trying to mislead the people by making false, factless allegations.
After Mumbai and Pune, now Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation will also purchase vaccines directly!

Vaccination in Pimpri Chinchwad area has been stopped today due to shortage of vaccines. The health department has appealed to people not to rush for vaccinations as the vaccination center is closed. The state health department will supply the vaccines to the municipal corporation by noon. Officials have said that the vaccination schedule for Tuesday will be announced only after the stock of vaccines is available.
The mayor said that discussions were also held with Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar regarding the purchase of vaccines directly through this global tender. She said that the Deputy Chief Minister himself said that if the municipal administration wants to buy vaccines directly, it does not need the permission of the state government.
Mayor Usha Dhore also said that once adequate stocks of vaccines became available, the entire city could be vaccinated. Currently, vaccinations have to be stopped in some places due to lack of vaccines. Citizens are crowding outside the vaccination center every day and forming large queues. This can increase the risk of corona proliferation. So we are planning to buy vaccines and stock up on enough vaccines. So that vaccination can be completed by avoiding congestion.
After Mumbai and Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation will be the third corporation to purchase vaccines directly, she said.

"The government, along with the citizens, ignored the warning of the second wave of Corona."

"
Britain had a bad situation after World War II; But Prime Minister Winston Churchill's office had written an enlightening sentence - "there is no place for pessimistic thoughts and the possibility of defeat," Bhagwat said.
Get ready like a
rock for the third wave Bhagwat appealed to the country to be ready for the third wave of Corona. Are we scared? "If the third wave comes, we should be ready like a rock crashing," Bhagwat said. "We must overcome the situation in this difficult time without losing courage and win, we must fight the Corona together with this conviction," he said.

This virus is similar to corona. Individuals who have a good immune system can overcome this viral infection. If the immune system is good, then the virus does not affect the body. However, the virus can be dangerous in people with weakened immune systems.
What are the symptoms of cytomegalovirus?
The initial symptoms of cytomegalovirus infection also appear after infection. Feel the changes in the personality of the affected person. Symptoms of cytomegalovirus include headache, difficulty breathing, and fever. Blood tests are done to diagnose cytomegalovirus infection. Cytomegalovirus is also found in young children. The virus is also found in pregnant women.

Discrimination in remedicivir injection delivery
These injections have sold for between Rs 50,000 and Rs 50,000.
422 injections to a 9-bed hospital and 260 injections to a 69-bed hospital
Chandrapur: Disaster Management Minister and Guardian Minister Vijay Vadettiwar's official Twitter account has revealed that there has been a huge discrimination in the distribution of Remedesivir injections given to critically ill patients in the district. Kirti Medical at Dr. Vishwas Zade's Spandan Heart Hospital, which has nine oxygen beds, received 422 injections of remedesivir, while 69 beds received only 260 injections. This discrimination is obvious and Dr. Zade was the Congress candidate from Ballarpur assembly constituency. It is now being shouted that this is his reward.
The black market of remedesivir injection has been going on in the district since the very first day. 
Also, a list has been given to 31 drug stores in the district. 
In Guardian Minister Vijay Vadettiwar's Bramhapuri Assembly constituency, 62 injections were given to Sparsh Medical Hospital at Khobragade Hospital with 25 beds and 260 injections to Christ Hospital with 48 beds at Astha Hospital with 40 beds. Meanwhile now Dr. The question arises as to why such a large number of remedesivirs were made available in the hospital when there was a shortage of oxygen beds.
What is special is that in the assembly elections, Dr. Zade was the Congress candidate against former minister MLA Sudhir Mungantiwar in the Ballarpur assembly constituency. There is a discussion as to whether they have benefited from the distribution of Remedesivir.
There is no discrimination in distribution
When CK Dange, an official of the Food and Drug Administration, was asked about this, he said that there was no problem in the Remedesivir injection delivery system. He also said that this did not happen in the district where Remedesivir was distributed.
As soon as the restrictions were relaxed, the city dwellers crowded the streets
Today, the highest number of daily infections in the district is found in Nagar taluka.
The growing number of patients in Nagar taluka is dangerous for the city
Nagar: As some restrictions imposed in the city due to the rising corona outbreak were relaxed from today, Saturday, some markets and streets were crowded in the morning. Many citizens were found to be violating the ban on double-seating on two-wheelers without the use of masks. Vendors had spread beds on the streets, especially vegetable vendors.
It is noteworthy that the number of coronet sufferers has increased from many villages in Nagar taluka. Today, the highest number of daily infections in the district is found in Nagar taluka. The number of patients is more in Nagar taluka than in Nagar city. The day to day affairs of many villages in the taluka also depend on the city. A large number of citizens from Nagar taluka come to Nagar for daily business. The city is in danger of increasing the number of coroners from Nagar taluka to villages.
From the end of April to the first week of May, the daily average number of patients in the city had increased from 700 to 800. Against this backdrop, Municipal Commissioner Shankar Gore visited the city on. Strict restrictions were imposed between May 2 and 10. Grocery stores and vegetable sales were also closed. Only medical services were started. The number of patients in the city has been declining since last week due to the closure of private establishments. An average of 250 to 300 are found daily. The number of patients has stabilized around 250 in the last few days. No further decline is seen.
In such a situation, the sale of groceries and vegetables has been resumed from today. The time has been fixed for this from 7 to 11 in the morning. Against the backdrop of kharif season, this time has been fixed for agricultural centers from 9 am to 4 pm. Time has also been given for transportation of agricultural inputs from 11 am to 1 pm. Farmers from the rural areas of the area come to the agricultural center in the city for shopping. The number of patients is increasing from all the talukas connected to the city. This is likely to result in an increase in the number of victims in the city.
As soon as the restrictions were relaxed, there was a rush of people from Dalmandai, Adtebazar, Bazar Samiti, Chitale Road, Chowpati Karanja and Dilligate. Corona prevention laws were being violated by many citizens. However, no squad was found on the road to stop him. Even when the medical service was in operation, many shops in the market were closed in front, but transactions were going on through the back door.

Relatives of patients in Satara, Shirkhurma to health workers
The Muslim Brotherhood celebrated Ramadan Eid by distributing Shirkhurma to the relatives, doctors and health workers of the patients at the 'Jumbo Kovid Center' area in Satara.
Ramadan Eid celebration by Muslim brothers
Y: The Muslim Brotherhood celebrated Ramadan Eid by distributing Shirkhurma to the relatives, doctors and health workers of the patients at the Jumbo Covid Center area in Satara.
Eid means uniting all communities and serving them. 
Today being Ramadan Eid, there is an atmosphere of great excitement everywhere. 
The youths and elders of the Muslim community in Satara had decided to celebrate Eid by distributing Shirkhurma to the relatives of the patients staying at the Satara Jumbo Hospital and other hospital premises to the doctors, nurses and health workers. 
At the treatment center in the air
Many corona care centers in rural areas of the district have been converted into corona treatment centers (DCHCs). 
Problems due to unavailability of medical officers, trained staff
Palghar: Many Corona Care Centers in rural areas of the district have been converted into Corona Treatment Centers (DCHCs). But due to non-availability of medical officers and trained staff in this center, patients are suffering. Relatives of the patients are also facing difficulties.
A corona health center with 50 oxygen beds has been set up in the health team building near Palghar Rural Hospital. Apart from this, the capacity of Corona Health Centers was also increased in Vangaon, Mokhada, Wada and Dahanu talukas. But there are not enough medical officers and nurses to treat the patients here as well as class IV staff to take care of them.
Due to the shortage of medical officers, trainee doctors or seasoned doctors are entrusted with the responsibility of the patient ward. But they have problems with treatment of corona patients, lack of skills on how to handle critically ill patients. Therefore, if a patient has low oxygen levels, it is time for the ward authorities to call the relatives of such patients to the treatment center and urge them to relocate the critically ill patient to the intensive care unit. At present, it is difficult to get a bed in the intensive care unit of a government or private hospital, which makes the relatives of the patient panic.
There is not even enough Class IV staff or help available to help patients go to breakfast or have a meal while undergoing oxygen therapy. Therefore, the critical patient has to do these tasks himself. In many of these cases, the patient is reported to have had serious complications due to lack of oxygen.
There is a shortage of manpower for cleaning toilets and rooms, changing the sheets on patients' beds or similar tasks. This raises the issue of health in Corona treatment centers and dedicated Corona hospitals.
Although oxygen beds have been made available, flowmeters and other technical equipment required to measure oxygen levels are not readily available, leading to technical difficulties in treatment. Although some centers are recruiting manpower on a seasonal basis, the lack of training has affected the mood and many employees have left. Therefore, some newly recruited medical officers, nurses, class IV staff and helpers need to be trained and counseled by psychiatrists, said the head of some treatment centers.
If the district administration acquires expert medical teams from various places in the district and asks them to provide services in corona centers, it will be more convenient to treat critically ill patients, the heads of some corona centers in the district told Loksatta.
Liquid diet for critically ill patients
Critically ill patients are being oxygenated and such patients have to have their oxygen system removed while going for lunch or breakfast. They have to bear the brunt of it. Similarly, the same type of meal is served in the hospital. But it is not always fruitful for all patients. Medical caregivers have suggested that it would be easier to care for critically ill patients if they were given a liquid diet instead of the usual meals given to critically ill and critically ill patients. Critical patients are being treated in the same manner in private hospitals and the government corona treatment center needs to follow suit.
Dissatisfied with the salary
In the Mumbai-Thane Municipal Corporation area, government and private hospitals are heavily paid to the medical staff and due to the limited funds available in the district, the officers and staff of the government corona hospitals in the district are not willing to work for a relatively low salary. As a result, there is a huge shortage of manpower in the district.
The need for a help center
Relatives of the patients are demanding that the Corona Treatment Center and the dedicated Corona Hospital should set up an out-of-hospital help and information center to provide information on the current status and progress of patients admitted to government hospitals.

I am working to cultivate a social commitment. If a patient's life is saved by your small effort, this satisfaction is too great for me.

The need for a crematorium in the cemetery
In Palghar Municipal Council area, there is a demand for installation of gas crematorium in the crematorium where coronary patients are cremated.
Smoke pollution in the area; The condition of all five iron right
Palghar: In Palghar Municipal Council area, there is a demand to install gas crematorium in the crematorium where coronary patients are cremated. It has been said for the last several months that a large quantity of firewood has been required for cremation of infected corpses here.
As there is a corona treatment center in Palghar Municipal Council area, the patients who die at that place are cremated in the cemetery east of Palghar. More than 100 bodies have been cremated in the cemetery since last month. It takes about 500 kg of wood and at least five liters of kerosene to bury a dead person. Thousands of kilos of wood and kerosene have been used on hundreds of such deaths so far.
This cemetery is open 24 hours a day. As a result, the smoke from here is spreading in the area and endangering the environment and the citizens of the area. At the same time, as all the five iron rights in the cemetery have been found in a bad condition, there is a demand to consider gas right while installing new ones. This will also reduce the cost and also reduce the emission of smoke as it is environmentally friendly and will not cause any environmental degradation. Therefore, there is a demand to install gas right.
It is proposed to supply gas through pipeline to households in Palghar Municipal Council area. This work has been approved. Therefore, since the pipeline will pass through different parts, it is possible to take the gas pipeline to the cemetery and make a gas burn there.
During the Corona period, smoke from funerals poses a threat to the environment. If gas right is used, it will avoid danger and will also save fuel. There is a demand to install gas right from Vasundhara Abhiyan.

Relatives grieve even after death of patients in Satara

How Maharashtra ranks first in the country in vaccination when vaccines are not available: Jayakumar Gore
The subject of vaccination is the biggest one today.
Y: Due to poor management of vaccination centers anywhere in the state, people are facing big problems at vaccination centers. Vaccines are not available anywhere but there is a big crowd at the vaccination center. MLA Jayakumar Gore has sarcastically criticized that Maharashtra is number one in the country in terms of vaccination when people are not getting vaccinated.

The subject of vaccination is the biggest one today. Online registration for vaccination. Pointing out that a man from Kolhapur is getting vaccinated in Phaltan and a man from Phaltan is not getting any vaccine, MLA Gore said, "The state government always says we are not getting vaccinated." On the one hand, they used to shout that they are not getting vaccinated and on the other hand, they claim that Maharashtra is number one in the country in vaccination. If vaccines are not available, then we are trying to find out how Maharashtra is number one.
The people of Phaltan taluka should be vaccinated in the taluka and in their own village. The administration says take any program in ten to twenty people, then thousands of people are standing in a crowd at the vaccination center to get vaccinated. The situation is dire and no one seems to be thinking of changing it, said MLA Gore.
MLA Gore told BJP state president Chandrakant Patil, who was present at the event online, that people, especially senior citizens, have to bear the brunt of the fuss over vaccination management. Therefore, MLA Gore demanded that we should try our best to ensure that the vaccination is carried out smoothly and that the planning is done properly.

Raigad supplies oxygen to Maharashtra's lungs; Mumbai, Pune and Marathwada became life savers
Daily supply of 630 metric tons of oxygen from the district
Alibag: The country is experiencing a shortage of oxygen due to the increasing prevalence of corona. Oxygen deprivation has been reported in many places. Are happening. Oxygen is being brought from different parts of the country by rail and water as there is a shortage of oxygen in many places in the state. In such a difficult time of oxygen scarcity, Raigad district has become a lifeline for the state. The district is supplying 630 metric tonnes of oxygen daily across the state.
In Raigad district, large quantities of oxygen are being produced at Pen Dolvi, Taloja and Mangaon. The JSW company at Pen Dolvi is producing 224 metric tonnes of oxygen per day, the company at Taloja 232 metric tonnes and the company at Mangaon 180 metric tonnes per day. Apart from this, 6 MT oxygen project has been set up at District General Hospital, Alibag. All these projects are producing 650 metric tons of oxygen per day. The rest of the oxygen is being supplied to various parts of the state, keeping the oxygen required by the district.
Coronary artery disease requires a large amount of oxygen for treatment. As a result, the demand for artificial oxygen has increased significantly. In such a situation, Raigad district has emerged as a major supplier of oxygen to the state. The district has so far supplied oxygen to Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, Ratnagiri, Sidhudurg, Satara, Kolhapur, Nanded, Beed, Aurangabad, Jalna, Parbhani and other districts.
No deaths were reported due to lack of oxygen in the district

Oxygen production projects will be set up in four sub-district hospitals

"Big scam in ventilators supplied by Center, even technicians can't fix it!", Sachin Sawant alleges!
The Congress has alleged that there was a big scam in the ventilators provided from the PM Care Fund.
A few days ago, ventilators were sent to Nashik from the Prime Minister's Assistance Fund. However, the ventilators were down due to lack of spare parts. While allegations are being leveled between the BJP and the ruling Mahavikasaghadi over the issue, the Congress has now made a sensational allegation that there was a big scam in the overall ventilator supply case. “Ventilators supplied from PMCare fund are showing a big scam. It is seen that there is a scam in the ventilators given to Ghati Hospital in Aurangabad and Nashik Municipal Corporation. Therefore, make a state-level inquiry into the ventilators provided across the state from the PM Care Fund, ”demanded Congress spokesperson and Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee general secretary Sachin Sawant.
State level inquiry of closed ventilators should be done!
Sachin Sawant said that the ventilators provided to the Ghati Hospital in Aurangabad were closed and even the technicians could not repair them. "A committee of medical experts appointed by the Government Medical College, Aurangabad has found that these ventilators are completely useless. According to his report, even company technicians could not fix it. This is a big scam and all the ventilators supplied to Maharashtra by the Center should be investigated at the state level, ”said Sachin Sawant.
Game with the soul of the people
"A similar scam has come to light in the ventilators given to Nashik. The BJP had made a big fuss over the provision of ventilators by the central government. But as many as 60 ventilators were in partial condition. Installation stopped due to lack of spare parts. Also, out of 35 ventilators sent from PM Care Fund in June, some ventilators are still out of order and due to non-receipt of spare parts from the concerned company, these ventilators are lying unused. The Modi government has played this game with the lives of the people, ”said Sawant.
Janata Rambharosech!
Speaking on the occasion, Sachin Sawant said, “It is unforgivable that public money is wasted through PM Care Fund. The Modi government forced all the corporates in the country to donate to this opaque fund. No information was provided about the fund or the right to information was enforced. But now the public must understand how and why such highly competitive companies got these contracts. Leave scandal in this biggest crisis for humanity but it is also inhumane to think of profit. Due to the arbitrariness of the Modi government, thousands of people lost their lives in the Corona epidemic due to lack of oxygen and ventilators. But the Modi government does not seem to have learned anything from that. The overall picture is that the people of the country have been released, ”said Sawant.
The 72-year-old received the first dose of covacin and the second dose of covishield; Shocking type in Rajesh Tope's district
Revealed when side effects appeared after taking the second vaccine
On the one hand, there is a shortage of corona vaccines in the country, while on the other hand, there is a big irresponsibility in Maharashtra regarding vaccination. In Maharashtra's Health Minister Rajesh Tope's Jalna district, an elderly man has been given two different doses of vaccine. This person was given the first dose of covacin. The second dose is Covishield vaccine. It is learned that after the second dose, the person was informed by his relatives that he was suffering. Doctors are monitoring the health of this person.
Dattatraya Waghmare, 72, of Khandvi village in Jalna, was given a dose of covacin on March 22 at a rural hospital in Partur. He was then called on April 30 for a second dose of the vaccine. When Dattatraya went for the second dose, he was given a dose of the covishield vaccine available at the health center in Shrishti village.
According to Waghmare's son Dingbar, Dattatraya had developed a fever and dry skin after taking the second dose. After experiencing the side effects of the vaccine, Dattatraya was taken by Dingbar to a health center in Partur. There they were given some medicine. The next day, Dattatraya was given two different doses of the vaccine.
After documents and information provided by the family, a team of doctors reached Dattatraya's house to examine him. Doctors were informed that Dattatraya had undergone heart surgery a few years back. The boy said that Dattatraya had undergone bypass surgery. My parents are uneducated. That is why they were not informed about the dose of the vaccine. This is due to the irresponsibility of the officials at the vaccination center. Digambar has said that the second vaccine was given by the medical staff without checking which vaccine was given earlier. An inquiry has been ordered into the matter, said Swapnil Lale, deputy director of health, Aurangabad division.

Vaccination is scarce in rural areas
Attempts fail; Misunderstandings, rumors
Palghar: While vaccination centers are crowded in urban areas, there is very little response to vaccination in rural areas of the district. Despite the efforts of the administration and the people's representatives, they are not getting the expected response. A special public awareness campaign has been launched in the dialect to motivate the villagers for vaccination. However, rumors and misinformation on social media are hitting vaccinations in rural areas.

Ignorance, misunderstandings and rumors circulating on social media in rural areas, especially among tribal villagers, seem to be hindering vaccination. MLAs in the district have tried to dispel their misconceptions. MLAs Sunil Bhusara, Srinivas Vanaga and Rajesh Patil took the first dose of vaccination. They are trying to encourage villagers to participate in the vaccination campaign through their activists. Dahanu MLA Vinod Nikole himself has not yet been vaccinated and said he would get vaccinated soon.
MLA absent from camp inauguration
MLA Vinod Nikole was invited to attend the inauguration of the vaccination camp held at Talasari Amgaon. However, the MLAs avoided attending the inauguration function. Zilla Parishad member Anil Zirwa launched the campaign by vaccinating himself. As MLA Vinod Nikle has not yet been vaccinated, it has become a topic of discussion in the constituency.
A special public awareness campaign has been launched in the dialect to provide information about Corona disease as well as vaccinations and to dispel misconceptions. Audio-video has been prepared to inform about the disease and it is being disseminated in the villages.
MLA Sunil Bhusara conducted an awareness campaign in his constituency about vaccination through loudspeakers as per the election campaign system. MLA Rajesh Patil organized vaccination camps in some places as well as seminars for private medical professionals. MLA Vinod Nikole campaigned for his party workers to get vaccinated themselves, while MLA Srinivas Vanaga campaigned to convince his own brothers about the importance of vaccination.

Symptoms of MISC disease in infants with antibodies
With proper diagnosis and timely treatment, the disease can be cured early, but if delayed, the patient's health is at risk.
Yavatmal: Pediatrician and IMA President Dr. Yavatmal has observed that the symptoms of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Post Covid (MISC) are prevalent in children with coronary heart disease as well as children who have developed antibodies to covid. Reported by Sanjeev Joshi. Six children with the disease have so far been found to be admitted to the hospital after the first Kovid Hospital for Children was started in Vidarbha.
With proper diagnosis and timely treatment, the disease can be cured early, but if delayed, the patient's health is at risk. The second wave of corona has a significant number of young people affected more than the elderly. So now, according to various medical reports, including government agencies at the national level, the third wave of corona is said to put children at greater risk. In this connection, while the government is planning for the treatment of children, there is concern over the discovery of children with symptoms of 'MISC-Post Covid' disease in Yavatmal.
After recovering from the corona infection, the children were found to have swelling on various organs of the body and to have adverse effects on the heart including limbs, eyes and eyes. Symptoms include swelling of the heart and formation of blood clots in the heart and body. After the mother of the child became infected with coronavirus, the disease was found to be exacerbated in children who did not have any symptoms of coronavirus but developed covid antibodies in the body. Sanjeev Joshi told Loksatta. It is found to affect children between the ages of 5 to 15 years. The symptoms of MISC-post covid are similar to those of Kawasaki disease, which is more common in children, he said.
Children in Europe and Britain had symptoms of the disease during the first wave of coronavirus.
The number of corona patients is high and the number of pediatric patients with MISC-post covid symptoms is also significant. Joshi said.

The corona report of the woman who died on May 8, 2020 was interrupted. 
There are others who help them.

The hospital, which handles such a large number of patients on the eve of the year of corona patient service, is pointed out that it does not have its own oxygen project. The administration had to rush for oxygen as the supply was cut off a month ago. Speaking on the occasion, administrative officer Dr. Uday Meghe said that it was only after the increase in the number of patients that he realized the need to have his own oxygen project. But now a Rs 2 crore oxygen project is proposed and it will be operational in some time. The government has demanded a small project and it will be implemented soon.

Lockdown hits textile industry again
There are 20 lakh looms in the decentralized sector in the country, out of which 50 per cent or more than one million looms are in Maharashtra.
Signs of dying machine spinning business
Sangli: The textile industry in the state is in trouble due to the Corona crisis, but the government's revenue has also sunk. While recovering from last year's crisis, the Corona crisis is showing signs of dying. The layoffs have hit three lakh people directly and one lakh indirectly in the textile industry.
Corona virus infections have paralyzed the entire world for the past year. 
However, considering the 10 lakh looms at Vita, Malegaon, Bhiwandi, Ichalkaranji and Sangli, 90 per cent of the looms are closed as 10 to 15 per cent of the factories do not have accommodation for the workers.
There are 20 lakh looms in the decentralized sector in the country, out of which 50 per cent or more than one million looms are in Maharashtra. Due to the 21-day lockout in the first phase, considering the average productivity of the spinning department, about 170 crore meters of cloth could not be produced. Its value was more than five thousand crore rupees. Of course, textile production worth Rs 5,000 crore has sunk. From the decentralized sector, the employment of three lakh direct and one lakh indirect workers depends on machinery alone. In these 21 days, their employment has gone down by about Rs. As textile production worth Rs 5,000 crore has sunk, the Center and the state governments have to release water directly on the GST revenue of Rs 250 crore at five per cent. MSEDCL, on the other hand, has to pay Rs 150 crore for the sale of 50 crore units of loom power in these 21 days.
Thus, the loss figures for the first 21 days of the loom department in the state's textile chain alone are so huge and alarming. Considering the entire textile chain together, this loss is going to be huge. Moreover, the longer the lockout period, the greater the losses. It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.
On the other hand, the fall in yarn and textile prices due to the shutdown will directly cost the spinners crores of rupees. This has become a matter of great concern. Yet in this terrible crisis of the country, all the spinning small scale entrepreneurs in the state have taken the role of cooperating with the government and the administration.
After coming out of this terrible crisis, however, only if a special assistance scheme is announced for this small scale industry, which is already in trouble, will this industry come to its former position. Due to the layoffs, the textile industry, which has the highest employability, needs to be given a boost in the future along with concessions. Otherwise, the well-known business is on the verge of extinction. - Kiran Tarlekar, President Vita Yantramag Sahakari Sangh.
No need for 'e-registration' for vaccination - Prithviraj Chavan
The online process for 18- to 44-year-olds should not be mandatory, so that the current hustle and bustle outside the vaccination center does not happen.
Karad: The e-registration process of vaccination is causing confusion. Former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan suggested that proper rules should be made for vaccination, drawing attention to the fact that the number of people in the district is also coming to Satara district as the number of the registrant is coming to any center. MLA Chavan called a meeting of the administration in Karad on the backdrop of increasing crowds for vaccination after positive awareness among the people about corona vaccination. The administration was present along with Prantadhikari Uttam Dighe and Tehsildar Amardeep Wakde.
Chavan said preference should be given to those with a second dose in vaccination. Also, the online process for 18- to 44-year-olds should not be mandatory, so that the current hustle and bustle outside the vaccination center does not happen. Also, every primary health center, sub-district hospital, rural hospital should be made public on a daily basis about the dose of vaccine. This will provide information to the people about vaccination and the administration will be able to control the crowd and the vaccination process will be carried out smoothly with proper planning.

The No Mask, No Entry campaign was implemented in the district, it has been successful and this campaign will be started again. Citizens in rural areas have covid-like symptoms, the collector said. Therefore, citizens should come forward and get their health checked. The health department should complete the ILI and SARI survey from door to door. If the person's report in the survey is positive, it should be submitted to Covid Care Center. On May 20, the Prime Minister will review the district's health facilities. Therefore, during the presentation, daily information of discharged patients, daily infected patients, deaths, active patients, RTPCR as well as antigen testing, ILI and all patients should be kept up to date, he said.

Lockdown has been increased but how will the working people live, what will the government do for them? - Everybody
Will this government ignore the demands of the top leaders of the alliance Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi? That is also the question.
The government has decided to extend the lockdown in Maharashtra till June 1. But before extending the lockdown, the BJP had repeatedly said that it should understand the plight of small businesses and hard workers and provide them with financial assistance, but the government announced the lockdown without considering it. The package announced by the government in the previous lockdown has not yet reached all the beneficiaries. While the BJP has been demanding help for the working class during the lockdown, now the leaders of the constituent parties in the Mahavikas Aghadi government, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, have also made the same demand to the Prime Minister. Won't the government understand the sentiments of the top leaders of the Ghatak party? Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council Pravin Darekar has asked this question to the government.
Darekar was speaking to the media after the state government decided to increase the lockdown. The decision to extend the lockdown without any planning has put the working class in even more trouble, what will the government do for them? This question has also been raised by Pravin Darekar.
"Mahavikas Aghadi government is responsible for the day-to-day postponement of
vaccinations" In fact, it was the responsibility of the state government to get these vaccines, but the Mahavikasaghadi government is running away from its responsibility and is doing such tricks. Until now, the vaccine had to be obtained by the state government. But still the government is just playing the game of correspondence. Where did the check kept by the government get stuck? Other states have booked vaccines, registered, paid and the Maharashtra government is still stuck in sending letters to the Center. Vaccination in the state is going on day by day and the Mahavikas Aghadi government is responsible for it, ”alleged Darekar.
"The Thackeray government is spending crores
to hide the real situation of Corona and to enhance its image" - "The Thackeray government is spending billions to hide the real situation of Corona and to promote its image by painting a false picture in front of the public. Therefore, by questioning what exactly the Thackeray government's PR agency is doing, this should be investigated at the senior level, ”Darekar has also demanded.
Also, the government is pretending to prevent the spread of corona through the media and advertisements, and a false image is being painted in front of the public to praise itself. But in today’s situation it is unnecessary. In the tribal areas, Dhule, Nandurbar, Palghar and Gadchiroli do not get response for treatment. While there is a need to spend on awareness and advertisements, the government is spending the hard earned money of the people for its own publicity.
"Global tendarababata government scam" -
"The government has said that global tenders, is going to write a letter to ask for permission to remove the central government. But on the one hand, the government has been saying that it has been processing the global tender since last week. Mumbai Municipal Corporation has even announced so. Is the alliance government seeking permission from the Center for the global tender and at the same time the municipal corporation is getting approval? Godbengal doesn't know anything about this, ”said Darekar.
"Government's reckless management
of vaccination revealed" - "The Central Government will vaccinate the citizens above 45 years of age and the State Government wants to vaccinate the citizens between the ages of 18 to 45 years." For this, the central government has announced to purchase 50 per cent vaccines from vaccine companies. While all this is clear, the state government is only trying to create confusion. Now that the first dose has been given to citizens above 45 years of age, they need to be given a second dose. The state government says 20 lakh doses are required, of which 10 lakh are available. In other words, there is no justice for Dhad 18 to 44 and no justice for the people above Dhad 45. Such a reaction was given by Darekar.
"Ministers sell vaccines to Bollywood actors illegally" -
Darekar today accused government ministers of selling vaccines to Bollywood actors illegally . What is the similarity between the government giving only 6.5 lakh vaccines to districts like Sangli and Satara and only 2 lakh vaccines to Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts in Konkan? He also demanded that the government should give an account of what the vaccine did to the people.
Maharashtra Lockdown: "If the Mumbai model is so successful, why punish Mumbaikars for another 15 days?"
Maharashtra Lockdown News: "Government does not dare to remove lockdown as it knows the true situation"
The Thackeray government has announced a decision to extend the lockdown in Maharashtra till June 1. The Thackeray government has increased restrictions to control the corona and made a negative RTPCR test report mandatory for foreign travelers. Meanwhile, BJP MLA Nitesh Rane has expressed anger over the decision to increase the lockdown. If the Mumbai model is so successful, then why punish Mumbaikars for another 15 days? He has asked such a question in an interview given to TV9.
"If the Mumbai model advertised by the Thackeray government is so successful, I don't know why they are increasing the lockdown. Basically the numbers are rife and even today people are not getting oxygen, they have to pay for beds. Remedesivir is feeling the shortage. Knowing the true situation, the government does not dare to remove the lockdown. Increasing the lockdown is an indirect acknowledgment that Corona's condition is serious, "said Nitesh Rane.
"If they are boasting so much about the Mumbai model, they are bombing so much, then why don't they reduce the restrictions in Mumbai? Why Mumbaikars sentenced to 15 more days? Why not start a business in Mumbai? "Everything is under control. If the restrictions are lifted, then the state government has sealed the fact that we are lying," he said.
"Money is being spent only for publicity and the truth is being concealed by lying. Why isn't the lockdown lifted when people are dying because of the economic situation? The rains will start in another 15 days. If everything is under control, let the people earn, ”he demanded. All love to Mumbai, so what do people in rural areas want to do? He also asked such a question.

Rohit Pawar's criticism of the yogi government
The health system in the rural areas of Unnao district is at 3 p.m.
Corona infection is on the rise in Uttar Pradesh. In the rural areas of Unnao district, the health system is at 3 p.m. A large number of bodies are being cremated on the banks of the river Ganga. The bodies are buried in the sand and cremated on the banks of the river Ganga. So the types of desecration of corpses are happening. NCP MLA Rohit Pawar has criticized the Uttar Pradesh government over this issue.
Rohit Pawar said, “It seems that Ganga has literally got the guideline of cremation after death due to Kovid in Uttar Pradesh. This raises the question of whether we are preventing or spreading Karona. Besides, the desecration of corpses is different! What to say It is shocking that there is no cure for life and contempt even after death!
Earlier, about 100 bodies were found on the banks of the river Ganga in Buxar, Bihar. The administration had later speculated that the bodies may have been transported from Uttar Pradesh. The incident has sparked clashes between the Bihar and Uttar Pradesh governments. Meanwhile, bodies have been found on the banks of the Ganges at Ghazipur in Uttar Pradesh after Buxar in Bihar. So one was blown away.
Massive deaths of villagers in many places in rural areas of Unnao
In the rural areas of Unnao, a large number of villagers are dying. Many of those who died had coughs, colds, and difficulty breathing. The death toll in rural areas is likely to be in the thousands, locals said. Around 300 bodies have been buried at Ganga Ghat in Rautapur in Unnao. This is so much so that there is no space left in this place for cremation. Sand began to fall on the banks of the Ganges to bury the dead. At present, the bodies are being cremated in an open space on a leopard. Some bodies are also seen being buried in the fields surrounding the place.
The district collector ruled out the possibility of a corona outbreak
Speaking to media in this regard, Unnao District Collector Ravindra Kumar said that he had received information that bodies were being buried on the banks of Ganga in Buxar. 
 The district collector has ruled out the possibility of corona infestation from these bodies. 
“Lockdown has increased again! Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had said, my family, my responsibility! ”
BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhyay targeted; He has also made a statement about Sharad Pawar
The state's Maha Vikas Aghadi government today announced a decision to increase the lockdown. State Health Minister Rajesh Tope had told the media yesterday that Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray would make an official announcement regarding the extension of the lockdown. After that, the guidelines have been announced by issuing an official order to extend the lockdown till June 1. The decision to maintain strict restrictions till May 31 was taken at the state cabinet meeting as the prevalence of corona is still prevalent in rural areas. As a result, BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhyay has targeted Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, NCP president Sharad Pawar and the Mahavikasaghadi government.
"The Chief Minister has taken responsibility for his family. Sharad Pawar has taken care of the bar owners. You take care of your family. There is no point in relying on the recovery government. In the recovery government, Farhan Akhtar is the darling to give the vaccine to the police, the common man is your guardian. ” This is what Keshav Upadhyay tweeted.
At the same time, “Lockdown has increased again. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had said, "My family, my responsibility!" My father, the state government has released you in a new wave. Look at your EMI, your house expenses, your light bill. ” That is also what Upadhyay has said.
The Thackeray government has tightened the restrictions and made the RTPCR test mandatory for people coming to the state from outside. A negative RTPACRR test report is mandatory for any person entering Maharashtra in any way and the report should have been prepared 48 hours before admission. Meanwhile, the earlier rules would apply to those coming to the state from any part of the country.
A few days back, Sharad Pawar had sent a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to draw attention to the problems in the hotel business and hospitality sector. Also, I am confident that the Chief Minister will sympathetically consider their demands with a view to providing relief to the professionals in the hospitality sector and under his guidance the people will be relieved from this crisis of Corona. This belief was also expressed by Sharad Pawar. This also shows that Keshav Upadhyay has commented.
"Modern vaccines are being given in and around Mumbai despite the ban"; Nawab Malik's sensational claim
Modern vaccination started even though only three companies are allowed in the country?
With only three companies allowed in the country, how is the modern vaccine system being implemented in France? If the public does not get permission then are they allowed as a special matter? Nawab Malik, National Spokesperson of the Nationalist Congress Party and Minister for Minorities, has demanded that the Center disclose this.
The central government says there is a shortage of vaccines in the country. The central government has approved vaccines from Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute and Sputnik. Meanwhile, Nawab Malik has alleged that information has become available that the modern company is vaccinating in this country and around Mumbai.
Vaccination has been introduced in some hospitals to give Moderna vaccine to citizens of foreign embassies, especially in France. Malik said Indian relatives of embassy citizens were also being vaccinated.
How is the modern vaccine being given when only three companies are allowed? This question has also been raised by Nawab Malik.
Meanwhile, due to shortage of vaccines in the state and the need to vaccinate people above 45 years of age, vaccination of citizens in the age group of 18 to 44 years has been postponed for some time. State Health Minister Rajesh Tope said yesterday that the next decision would be taken based on the availability of vaccines.
Maharashtra Lockdown:… Otherwise no access to Maharashtra; Big decision of Thackeray government
Maharashtra Lockdown News: Lockdown extended till June 1
The Thackeray government has decided to extend the lockdown till June 1 and an official order has been issued. The Thackeray government has announced some new restrictions this time. At this time, the Thackeray government has made the negative RTPCR test report mandatory for those traveling abroad. Without it, it will not be possible to enter Maharashtra from outside the state. The order states that the report should have been issued 48 hours earlier. Meanwhile, the earlier rules would apply to those coming to the state from any part of the country.
In addition, both the driver and the cleaner will be allowed in the cargo carrier. If the cargo carriers are entering from a foreign country, a negative RTPCR test report is mandatory and must be removed within 48 hours, the order said.
It will be the responsibility of the municipality to monitor the local markets as well as the APMC to ensure that the rules of corona are being followed. If the rules are not followed in a place or the situation cannot be handled, the local administration may decide to increase or close the restrictions there.
Airport and port staff who have to travel for medicines and corona-related materials are allowed to travel by local, mono and metro. If a restriction is to be extended in a place, the local administration has been given the right to do so and a notice has to be given 48 hours before the ban is imposed. All these restrictions will be in force till 7 am on June 1.
Strict restrictions have been imposed in the state since April 14 to curb the outbreak of corona. Earlier, the ban was in force till May 1 and then it was extended till May 15. As the deadline expires on Saturday, it was discussed at a state cabinet meeting. Due to this restriction, the corona epidemic in the state has come under control and the growth rate of the state has come down. Although the number of victims of corona in 10 to 15 districts has come down, the number of victims is still high in some districts. Therefore, most of the ministers had made a one-sided demand to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to extend the existing restrictions for another 15 days. Accordingly, it has been decided to increase the lockdown.
The hotel business on the highway started secretly
Fear of increasing corona infection in Palghar district
Palghar: Although hoteliers in the state are allowed to continue parcel services, most of the hotels along the Mumbai-Ahmedabad National Highway are found to be operating secretly around midnight. Parcels during the day and crowds of customers at night can be seen in some hotels. This has led to fears of a new corona infection.
More than 16,000 coroner's cases were found in rural areas of Palghar district in Mumbai and Gujarat in April. In the rural areas of the district, the number of patients was increasing from 800 to 900 per day. At present, due to the lockout, the number of patients has increased from 200 to 250. Under the 'Break the Chain' campaign to bring Corona under control, the state government has allowed hoteliers to provide only parcel services. Despite this, some hoteliers on the highway have been found to have parcel facilities during the day and hotels at night. Fifteen to seventeen large hotels on both sides of the National Highway within the boundaries of the Manor Police Station are secretly open at night. Although a police patrol patrolled the area every hour, no action has been taken against any hotelier so far.
A hotelier near Manor recently died of a corona infection, and some local workers in the state's driver's catering service have reportedly contracted the disease. Truck drivers from Gujarat, Rajasthan, Delhi and other states come to the hotel for dinner. They are admitted through the back door. This type has led to fears of a new corona infection. When contacted, Palghar Superintendent of Police Dattatreya Shinde said only parcel service would be provided from the hotel along the highway.
Meanwhile, hoteliers along the national highway have been accused of being sheltered by the police while ordinary citizens are being prosecuted for violating the law.
Access through the back door
The front shutters of most hotels along the national highway are kept closed. Also, if a two-wheeler or four-wheeler comes in front of the hotel for a meal, they are told by the guard sitting outside the hotel that the hotel is closed. However, truck drivers are allowed to park their vehicles through the second door of the air-conditioned room in the hotel or through the back door of the hotel. Most of the hotels in the Manor area are packed between 9pm and 11pm, according to reliable sources. It is said that many hotels along the highway from Talasari to Virar are also operating in the same manner.
82-year-old patient goes missing from Corona Center in Vasai
The problems are further aggravated by the fact that the patient is not registered in the municipal docket.
Vasai: An 82-year-old elderly citizen was admitted to Varun Karona Treatment Center at Valiv of Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation for treatment. However, the shocking fact that this patient has been missing for the last few days has come to light. The problems are further aggravated by the fact that the patient is not registered in the municipal docket.
Ramchandra Das (82) of Veer Savarkar Nagar in Vasai was taken to Varun Karona Center on April 22 at around 7.45 pm for treatment. After completing 14 days of treatment, his relatives went to fetch him on May 5, but it was learned that Ramchandra Das was not at the Corona Center. It has been found that there is no record of this patient even in the municipal office.
Since Ramchandra Das has no one, he has been with us for the last several years. So now that he is in Corona, we informed the municipality and admitted him to Varun Industry for treatment. But now they are not there, so where did they go? Even if something happened to them, the municipality should have given us the same information. No such information was received, said Gorachandra Mukherjee, a relative.
Because Ramchandra Das is an old man, he can't walk alone, so how can he disappear from here? Mukherjee has demanded that the municipal corporation should give us proper information in this regard. For this, by informing the officials of the municipality, it is being demanded that the matter should be investigated as to where the patient Ramchandra Das went from Varun Kendra. Municipal Deputy Commissioner Kishor Gavas said that the patient has gone missing and the matter will be thoroughly investigated.
Corona control panel in each ward
Facility to provide timely and appropriate treatment to patients in Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation area
Vasai : The Municipal Corporation has decided to set up Corona Control Rooms in all the nine wards for timely treatment of Corona sufferers. These rooms will be open 24 hours a day. The patients will be admitted to the hospital and given proper treatment and medicines as well as medical help will be provided to the patients who are undergoing treatment at home.
The population of Vasai-Virar city is over 25 lakhs and an average of 700 to 800 patients are seen daily. 
The patients were not getting hospital beds and other medical facilities. 
This will be the control room
The control room is being set up in nine wards of the city. 
These control rooms will control all the private hospitals in the ward. 
This departmental control room will make it easier to provide medical care to every Corona patient, to get them the right treatment. Each Corona Center will be overseen by a Deputy Commissioner as a nodal officer. As the control room will be open 24 hours a day, citizens will benefit from it.
"People want to make my village tax-free, so what are we going to do?"
Maharashtra lockdown: Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has announced to extend the lockdown in the state till June 15.
The second wave of corona had created a dire situation in the state. The pace of patient growth has been slowing down over the last few days, with the number of patients declining. However, there is still no noticeable decline in the daily number of patients. Therefore, the state government has decided to increase the lockdown. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray while interacting with the people of the state on Sunday night announced that the lockdown would be extended for 15 days. After the announcement made by the Chief Minister, the BJP has pointed out some issues and asked six questions to the Chief Minister.

The lockdown in the state has been divided into two sections according to the number of patients. 
So that people do not leave these districts or citizens from other districts do not come to districts with high number of patients
Restrictions partially relaxed
Lockout till June 15: Shops open till 2 pm; Decisions at the local level
MUMBAI: Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday announced that the lockout restrictions would be maintained till June 15 as the number of patients was not reduced as desired despite the second wave of corona. However, local authorities have been given the power to relax restrictions in areas where the number of patients is low. Accordingly, shops with essential services in cities and districts with low number of patients will be open from 7 am to 2 pm.
The decision to allow shops other than essential services to be kept open can now be taken by the Municipal Commissioner in the big cities or the District Collector in the districts. The government has given the right to allow shops to open at the local level.
There are two divisions according to the number of patients. Restrictions will be relaxed if the A-grade corona test contains 10 per cent or less of the corona and the oxygen-filled bed is less than 40 per cent. Shops in such cities and districts will be open from 7 am to 2 pm. The decision to open other shops will be taken by the local administration. However, single shops will be allowed to remain open. Opening of malls or commercial complexes will not be allowed. Other shops will be open till 2 pm just like essential services. Also, shops will be closed for two days on Saturdays and Sundays except for essential services.
Strict restrictions will be in place in districts where the proportion of coronaries affected in the test is 20 per cent or more. The boundaries of such districts will be closed. So that people will not leave this district or citizens from other districts will not come to districts with high number of patients. As it is the farming season, shops for fertilizers, seeds, implements etc. have been allowed to remain open till 2 pm. Local administrations are empowered to make timely decisions.
There will be no time constraint for supply of grains, pulses, fruits, vegetables etc. Can supply goods at any time in shops. Shops can be kept open only after 2 pm for storage of goods. But customers will not be able to sell during that time. If found, strict action has been taken. Hotels are still allowed home delivery service. You can't sit in hotels and enjoy food. These rules will remain in force till 7 am on June 15.
Which shops will be allowed ?
Citizens are more curious about whether they will be allowed to open hairdressing salons, computers, rain gear, clothes etc. In cities or districts with low patient numbers, the local administration may decide. The decision on which and how to allow shops to be opened will be taken at the local level.
' We need a national policy on exams '
The state government decided on the matriculation examination. Now we are reviewing what to do with the 12th standard exam. Let's decide soon. However, the central government will also have to take some decisions regarding post-secondary vocational courses. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said that since the exams are a matter of future for the next generation and the situation is different in different states, there is a need to formulate a national policy on exams and the central government should take that decision.
In a speech to the people of the state on Sunday, Thackeray said that he was ready to send a letter to the central government.

1,52,734 new Corona patients found in the country, 3,128 deaths
The effects of the second wave of coronavirus in India are slowly
The second wave of the Corona is wreaking havoc on the country. 
Although the number of infected patients is declining, the death toll does not appear to be declining. 
The number of discharged patients is higher than the number of infected patients. In the last 24 hours, 238,022 patients have been cured. In addition, there are currently a total of 20,26,092 active cases of corona in India. So far, 2,80,47,534 patients have been found in the country. Also, 256,92,342 people have overcome Karona. So far, 329,100 patients have died due to corona.

'No vaccine, no alcohol', notices in front of liquor shops in this district
The Additional Collector of Uttar Pradesh has made a strange rule. The rule has sparked a debate in front of every liquor store in Saifai in Uttar Pradesh's Etawah district.
Citizens are worried about the second wave of corona in the country. The rushing waves wreaked havoc. Experts also doubt that a third wave of corona will occur. So the country is being vaccinated. But many people are ignoring vaccinations. As a solution to this, the Additional District Collector of Uttar Pradesh has made a strange rule. The rule has sparked a debate in front of every liquor store in Saifai in Uttar Pradesh's Etawah district.
Alcohol will not be available in the city without a certificate of vaccination, the notice said. The notice was issued on the instructions of Additional Collector Hem Kumar Singh. This strange order is being hotly debated on social media.
The notice was issued by Hem Kumar Singh after several deaths due to poisoning in Aligarh. Hem Kumar Singh along with district police officers inspected liquor shops in Saifai after the Aligarh poisonous liquor scam. Hem Kumar Singh, meanwhile, explicitly instructed liquor shops to put up notices saying 'no vaccine, no alcohol'. Earlier this month, at least 25 people died in Aligarh after consuming poisonous liquor.
This was also confirmed by the employees of the liquor shops in Saifai. That said. The Additional Collector has told us that by doing so, more and more people will be vaccinated. But Etawah District Excise Officer Kamal Kumar Shukla said no orders had been issued to stop the sale of liquor to those who have not yet received it. However, the efforts of the district administration to promote vaccination should be encouraged, but there are no orders to issue vaccine certificates for the purchase of liquor.
“The use of monoclonal antibody cocktails on corona patients is extremely important”; Opinion of former head of ICMR
Advice to use antibody cocktail 3 to 10 days after corona test positive
Many effective drugs are being used to treat corona patients. There is now a drug added to it. The drug is called 'Antibody Cocktail' and has been approved by the Central Government. Therefore, it is claimed that Corona patient can be cured in a week. The monoclonal antibody cocktail is unlikely to cause further mutations, said Dr. ICMR's former chief scientist. Gangakhedkar said. He advised to use this method rationally.
Antibody cocktails made by Indian pharma company Rosh India are being given to patients with mild symptoms of corona before. The drug was approved for emergency use by the Central Drugs Standards Control Organization (CDSCO).
Dr. Raman Gangakhedkar said on Sunday, "In theory, monoclonal antibody cocktails are unlikely to cause mutations in the virus. A person is more likely to get a moderate to severe illness with an antibody cocktail rather than a virus. ” He gave this information while talking to ANI news agency.
“Antibody cocktails can prevent the virus from recurring. The rational use of antibody cocktails is “essential”. Antibody cocktails should be used within three to ten days after corona infection, ”said Dr. Raman Gangakhedkar said. He also said there was no evidence that monoclonal antibody cocktail treatment could protect against newer variants of the corona.
This cocktail injection is made by combining two types of antibodies, Casirivimab and Imdevimab. A single dose of this injection costs Rs 59,750. This cocktail has been made available in the Indian market by Cipla Company. It can also be used in children weighing more than 40 kg, said Dr Naresh Trehan, a renowned cardiologist and president of Medanta Hospital. Former US President Donald Trump was given an antibody cocktail after being infected with the corona.

The country now produces ten times as much oxygen 
Prime Minister Modi's statement in 'Mann Ki Baat'
New Delhi:  Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that the country was fighting the Corona virus with all its might, adding that oxygen production had been increased tenfold.
In the second wave of Coronation, many states faced the crisis of oxygen shortage. 
The Prime Minister interacted with those who play a key role in transporting oxygen. Overseas tanker driver Dinesh Upadhyay, Oxygen Express driver Shirisha Ghazni and Air Force Captain Patnaik lauded the service rendered. Regarding this, Modi said, "During the Karona crisis, we made the slogan 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas' meaningful. During the crisis, a female train driver delivered oxygen tankers, while a female Air Force officer delivered oxygen on time. They worked day and night to supply oxygen, ”he said.
The Corona outbreak claimed many lives. 
It has been proven that India does not compromise on the issue of national security.
Initially, there was only one corona testing laboratory in the country, but now there are 2500 laboratories in operation and more than 20 lakh corona tests are being done every day, Modi said. Modi interacted with laboratory technician Prakash Kandpal and listened to his experiences.
After seven decades of independence, 3.5 crore houses were built in rural areas, while 4.5 crore new plumbing connections were provided in the last 21 months, Modi said. He also said that poor patients have got new life due to Ayushman Bharat Yojana. People are satisfied with the arrival of electricity in the village in 70 years. He also pointed out that many rural areas are connected by roads.
During the BJP government, there were many moments that the country would be proud of , but also had to face challenges. Along with national security, development plans were also implemented.

Test period 
'In the last seven years, India has taken the lead in digital transactions. Records are being set in launching satellites and building roads.

During the Coronation period, India moved forward through service and cooperation. In the first wave we fought bravely. This time too, India will overcome this wave.
Tribes flee to avoid corona test!
The residents of Kuta Chaurani village fled into the forest
Pithoragarh : In Uttarakhand, a team of health workers from Pithoragarh district recently went to a tribal village to test Kovid-19, but they fled to a nearby forest to escape.
Kuta Chaurani is the home of the endangered tribe of Banarawat.
The tribals fled to the nearby forest after receiving information that the Kovid test team would arrive in their village on Friday, said Didihat Sub-Divisional Magistrate K.N. Goswami said on Sunday. The Banarawat community was declared an endangered tribe by the central government in 1967.
'500 members of this tribe are living in 8 settlements of Didihat sub-division. We had sent Corona test teams to Aultari, Jamtari and Kuta Chaurani villages. The 191 residents of Aultari and Jamtari villages were ready for the test, but the residents of Kuta Chaurani village fled into the forest, 'said Goswami.
Fear of ' swab strip '
The villagers feared that they would be infected by the swab strip used for corona testing, Goswami said. "We are ready for health check-ups and medicines, but it is not acceptable for us to inject the bandage," said Jagat Singh Rajwar, an elderly member of the Banrawat community in Kuta Chaurani village.
The corona virus is a Chinese product; The claim in the dissertation
Research has shown that SARS COV 2 is not a natural ancestor of the corona virus.
LONDON : A study report claims that the virus was created by China using genetic engineering amid growing demand around the world for the origin of the corona virus. Chinese scientists from Wuhan's laboratory joined in, then changed its appearance to show that it came from a tiger and designed it in a way that would make it look natural, according to research presented by British professor Angus Dalgesh and Norwegian scientist Bergk Sorensen.
Research has shown that SARS COV 2 is not a natural ancestor of the corona virus. 
Chinese researchers were experimenting with reverse engineering to create a virus similar to that of bats.
Information about the virus was later destroyed. Even Chinese scientists are not ready to talk about it.
The 22-page dissertation will be published in the journal Science Journal Quarterly Review Biophysics Discovery. 
This makes the virus more contagious.

Mortality percentage for the last five months
January - 1.15 percent
February - 0.78 percent
March - 0.52 percent

'100 million doses of Kovishield in June'; Letter of Serum Institute to the Center
"Working day and night to increase production"
The vaccination campaign has slowed down as the country is experiencing a shortage of corona vaccines. Opposition groups called for a boycott of the assembly. For this, additional information about Corona vaccine is being provided by the Central Government to the States and Union Territories. The Union Health Ministry has announced that 12 crore vaccines will be available in June. Now, the Serum Institute has said that it will provide 100 million vaccines to the central government by June. Serum Institute has given a letter to Home Minister Amit Shah in this regard.
"We want to tell you that in June, we will produce and supply 100 million covshield vaccines. In May, 6.5 crore doses were manufactured and supplied. Given the demand in the country, we have increased the production of vaccines. The Serum Institute is committed to caring for the citizens of the country. Our entire team has joined hands with the government to fight against Corona, ”said Prakash Kumar Singh, director of the company's regulatory division.
"We are getting full support from the central government for constructive work. We are working hard to increase production in the years to come, ”he said in his letter.
The letter states that the Covishield vaccine manufacturing company in Pune is working day and night. "We are working hard to meet the demand for corona vaccines in the country," it said. Earlier, Siram had said that 6.5 crore vaccines would be produced in June. It was also said that 70 million vaccines would be produced in July and 100 million in August and September.
Corona virus production in China's Wuhan lab !; Scientists have found evidence
Corona virus man-made?
Arguments are now being fought over how the corona virus was formed after the corona took over the world. Professor Angel Dalglish of Britain and Norwegian scientist Dr. Birger claimed that the corona virus was produced in China's Wuhan lab. For this, he studied the corona virus in depth. He claimed in his report that the study revealed shocking facts. China used retro engineering to hide its black act after creating the corona virus. Also, the virus did not appear to be man-made but spread through bats. However, he claimed that the virus could not have been created without human intervention. China has often been viewed with suspicion.
Corona virus has no natural properties. So they claim that it is completely man-made. It has also been produced in the 'Gain of Function' project. The Chinese took the corona's backbone from the caves in the cave and made it more deadly by putting spikes on it. They claim that the virus was created in a lab because of its human-to-human properties. This was revealed while studying for the production of the corona vaccine. This was reported by Daily Mail.
The information in the Wuhan Lab was deliberately hidden and then attempted to be destroyed. Also, the scientists who raised their voices on this were either silenced or disappeared. Many scientific journals refused to publish the findings of the research. Therefore, China's brass was not exposed, he added.
A World Health Organization team visited Wuhan in January. The team then claimed that the corona was formed naturally.

It is wrong to call Aquarius 'Super Spreader'; Out of 9 lakh tests, only 0.2 per cent report was positive
Only 0.5 per cent of police personnel deployed for Kumbh Mela are infected with coronavirus, a senior official said
A senior police official has said that it is wrong to call the Kumbh Mela a 'super spreader'. He informed that out of the total RTPCR tests conducted in Haridwar from January 1 to the end of Kumbh Mela, only 0.2 per cent came back positive. He also told PTI that only 0.5 per cent of the police personnel deployed for the Kumbh Mela were corona.
Inspector General of Police Sanjay Gunjayal, who is in charge of the Kumbh Mela, said, "When the program started on April 1, the number of patients was increasing due to the second wave of corona in states like Maharashtra and Haryana."
"If we take a closer look at the Kovid data of Haridwar district from January 1 to April 30, it is clear that the attempt to show that Kumbh Mela has become a super spreader in the Corona crisis is wrong," said Sanjay Gunjayal. During the Kumbh Mela, Sanjay Gunjayal was responsible for the security of Haridwar and surrounding areas.
A total of 8 lakh 91 thousand RTPCR tests were conducted in Haridwar between January 1 and April 30. Of these, 1954 tests (0.2 per cent) were positive, he said. Giving another explanation as to why Kumbh Mela cannot be called 'Super Spreader', he said, "16,000 policemen were deployed for Kumbh Mela. As of April 30, only 88, or 0.5 per cent, of the police personnel had contracted coronary heart disease.
The Modi government was heavily criticized for crowding the Kumbh Mela with millions of people across the country. The Kumbh Mela was noticed internationally. On April 17, Modi had symbolically appealed for the program to be carried out.

Central government angry over 'hospital vaccination package' of private hospitals; Orders of action to the states
Warning of legal action against hospitals offering vaccination packages
Some private hospitals have joined hands with luxury hotels to offer corona vaccination packages in violation of the rules and the central government has warned that legal action will be taken against them. The health ministry has written to the states and union territories asking them to ensure proper compliance with the rules while conducting the national corona vaccination campaign.
According to the rules, vaccination can be done in government or private centers, workplaces, social centers, panchayat buildings, schools, colleges, old age homes. Also, vaccinations for senior citizens and persons with disabilities can be arranged by the societies near the home.
Apart from these, it is illegal to plan vaccinations in other places and the Ministry of Health has warned that legal action will be taken against them. Due to this, the Ministry of Health has pointed out that vaccination in big hotels is not in accordance with the rules.
Hotels are offering covid vaccination packages which include accommodation, breakfast, dinner, WiFi as well as vaccinations from expert doctors on request. This had sparked criticism on social media.
Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had questioned how private hospitals were getting these doses when the Center was not in stock and the Center had stopped vaccinations for 18- to 44-year-olds due to shortage of vaccines. Manish Sisodia had asked, "If the Delhi government wants to vaccinate all the youth for free, how do they become available in private patients when there are no vaccines available for it?" He had noticed that hotels charge Rs 1,000 for this.
Consolation to Indians! The second wave is waning; The pace of growth slowed
Coronavirus updates: Fewer deaths in the country after six weeks
The first wave of Corona hit the second wave while the life of the people passing through Kollam was coming back to normal. Corona's new strain caused the patient population to explode. India recorded an unfortunate one-day world record for the number of corona patients. From February, the situation in the country began to deteriorate. March and April saw the ordeal of death. Unprecedented heart-wrenching conditions were observed for patients outside hospitals, for medical remediation outside, and for funerals outside cemeteries. This dire situation is slowly receding, with statistics showing signs of another wave of corona sweeping the country.

Corona had raised concerns about the growing number of deaths in the country along with the outbreak. Four and a half thousand deaths were reported daily in the country. In a few weeks, the country averaged between three and a half to four thousand deaths a day. As a result, the health system was asleep. However, the number of patients is now slowly declining. Three 460 patients have died in the last 24 hours in the country. However, the death toll is still alarming.
The Center has now stopped the supply of antimicrobial drug to the states. Union Minister Mansukh Mandvi informed about this decision. "Since the states have sufficient reserves, there is no need for supply from the center now. Now the country also has adequate stocks of remedivir. We are cutting off the supply of remedicivir to the states as the supply exceeds the demand, ”he said.

Center's inefficiency causes oxygen shortage - Priyanka 
The government will have to answer to the people for the deaths caused by Kovid-19
New Delhi: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi-Vadera on Saturday blamed the government's inefficiency and lack of planning for the country's second wave of corona. She also said that the government will have to answer to the people for the deaths caused by Kovid-19.
Priyanka has launched a 'Who is responsible' campaign and is questioning the way the government has handled the Kovid-19 situation. He also accused India of increasing its oxygen exports by 700 per cent in 2020 and making no effort to import oxygen despite the country's second wave of demand for oxygen. It is clear that the shortage is due to inefficiency and lack of planning by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi government, she said.

States will no longer receive remedicivir injections from the central government; 'It' is because
Information of Union Minister of State for Chemistry Mansukh Mandavia
Although the second wave of corona was declining, the death toll was setting a record in the last two months due to the growing number of patients and inadequate medical equipment. Demand for oxygen and remedial injections also increased. This led to an increase in the black market for remedivir injections. Police raided several places and seized injectable remedesivir. However, due to declining production, it has become difficult to get Remedesivir injections. Therefore, the central government was supplying remedesivir injection to the states. But now the central government has made it clear that states should buy injections directly from the company. Union Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilizers Mansukh Mandavia has informed about this.
"I am happy to tell you that the production of Remedesivir injection has increased tenfold. This was made possible by the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. On April 11, 2021, 33,000 injections were being produced daily. Now this product has reached three and a half lakhs, ”tweeted Mansukh Mandavia.
There were 20 factories making Remedesivir injection. Since then, the number has risen to 60. As a result, there is more supply than demand. Therefore, the central government has decided to cut off the supply of remedicivir injection to the states, he added. It has also ordered the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Agency and CDSCO to monitor the availability of remedesivir.
The impact of the second wave is slowly diminishing in the country as well. 
 The number of discharged patients is higher for the 16th consecutive day than the number of infected patients.
Comfortable! Decline in the number of corona patients in Delhi
Delhi's step towards unlock?
The last few days in Delhi have seen a dramatic drop in the number of corona patients. In the last 24 hours, nearly 900 crore patients have been registered, according to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. This is the first time such a low number of patients has been reported in the second wave of Corona. At the same time, the death rate in Delhi has come under control. Therefore, there is a positive picture that Delhi is taking a step towards unlock.
Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal inaugurated the 'Drive Through Vaccination' at Chhatrasal Stadium in Delhi. Then Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal gave this information. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia was also present with him. Delhi currently has a lockdown till May 31. In view of the Corona situation in Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had extended the lockdown for the fifth time. Metro service has also been suspended during this period. So now the focus is on what Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal decides.
Although the number of patients in Delhi has come down, the vaccination drive has slowed down. Therefore, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has planned to buy vaccines from abroad. Delhi's health ministry has launched a global tender to procure 10 million doses. June 7 is the last date for submission of proposals for this tender.
The impact of the second wave is slowly diminishing in the country as well. For the second day in a row, less than two lakh Corona patients were found in the country. A total of 1.73 lakh new Corona patients have been found in the last 24 hours. This is the lowest number in the last 45 days. During this period, 3617 people have lost their lives due to corona. The number of discharged patients is higher for the 16th consecutive day than the number of infected patients. In the last one day alone, 2.48 lakh patients have been cured. With this, the recovery rate in India has now reached 90 per cent and is expected to grow rapidly. There are currently 22,28,724 active cases of corona in India.
IMA challenges yoga guru Ramdev Baba for open discussion!
The Uttarakhand IMA, outraged by the remarks made by yoga guru Ramdev Baba about doctors treating corona in the country, has challenged Ramdev Baba for an open discussion.
Yoga guru Ramdev Baba's statement about Karona's treatment in hospitals has caused a great deal of controversy in the country. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has strongly objected to Ramdev Baba's statement. The IMA has written a letter to the Center to protest the statement and a case has also been registered against Ramdev Baba. Against this backdrop, on the one hand, the central board of the IMA is demanding that Ramdev Baba withdraw his statement completely, but now the Uttarakhand IMA has directly challenged Ramdev Baba to have an open discussion. Ramdev Baba had announced a list of about 25 questions addressed to the doctors. Since then, this challenge has been given by Uttarakhand IMA.
In the viral video, Ramdev Baba said
A few days ago, a video of Ramdev Baba went viral on social media. In it, he claimed that a thousand doctors had died even after he had been vaccinated against both coronaviruses. "What kind of doctor is he who can't save himself?" He was also seen asking such a question.
After this video, another video of Ramdev Baba went viral. In it, “People sometimes run the trend of arresting Ramdev Baba on social media and sometimes Ramdev Baba runs the trend of being a thug. Keep going, but now we’ve learned these qualities as well, and the trends we run are also at the top. Even his father can't arrest him, "he said.
Demand to file a case of treason
Outraged by all this, the IMA, the apex body of doctors, sent a notice of Rs 1,000 crore to Ramdev Baba. He also apologized for his statement. Not to be outdone, IMA has also written a letter directly to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding that a treason case be filed against yoga guru Ramdev Baba .
"We don't bow to them"
Meanwhile, speaking about the complaint filed against Ramdev Baba, IMA central president Dr. G. A. Jayalal said, "We have nothing to do with Ramdev Baba. If Ramdev Baba withdraws his statement completely, we will withdraw our complaint. We think his statements can create confusion among the people. We are scared because we have so many followers. ”
Against this backdrop, now that Uttarakhand IMA has challenged Ramdev Baba for an open discussion, what steps will be taken by him will be important.

Full vaccination by December
Covishield and covacin vaccines are being used for vaccination.
Testimony of Union Minister Prakash Javadekar
New Delhi: Despite three per cent vaccination in the country so far, 216 crore doses of corona vaccine will be given by December, meaning 108 crore people will be vaccinated in the next six months, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said on Friday.
Replying to a question at a press conference after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi criticized the Modi government for not having a vaccination policy, Javadekar said, "If vaccination is really a concern, look at what is going on in the Congress-led states. These states have not even lifted the quota of vaccines given by the Center for the age group of 18 to 44 years.
Covishield and covacin vaccines are being used for vaccination. In addition, Zydus Cadila vaccines, NovaVax, Sputnik and Genova will be available. Foreign vaccines can also be found in the country. As a total of 216 crore vaccines will be produced, complete vaccination will be done before the end of 2021, said Javadekar.
Rahul Gandhi says vaccination is the solution, but we have been saying it since the first day of the Corona disaster. "India has become the second fastest and most vaccinated country in the world to vaccinate 200 million people," Javadekar said.
Discussions are underway to import vaccines from foreign companies Pfizer and Moderna, with Pfizer vaccines expected to be available in India by July. Referring to this, Javadekar said, "The availability of vaccines in the country will increase from August."
Addressing the Congress, Javadekar said, "It is now clear that you have created a toolkit. He no longer needs any evidence. The kind of language you are using and creating confusion and fear in people's minds is part of the same politics.
Who opposed Kovacin?
Rahul Gandhi said that the country has become the capital of vaccine production. Referring to it, he said, "Kovacin is a vaccine made entirely in India. However, Congress leaders were skeptical about the usefulness of Kovacin. People were misrepresenting that they should not take covacin. A Congress leader had even ridiculed this vaccine as 'Modi vaccine'. But Modi has taken the covacin vaccine, said Javadekar.
Everything according to the toolkit
According to the script of the Congress' Toolkit, Rahul Gandhi used the term 'habit of drama' for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. "It is an insult to the country to use abusive words against Modi while he is fighting against Corona," Javadekar said.

"Center creates artificial scarcity for the benefit of vaccine companies"; Serious allegation of 'you'
"Many countries around the world have allowed the use of different vaccines. So why is the emergency use of only three vaccines approved in our own country?
The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has accused the Center of creating an artificial shortage of vaccines for the benefit of vaccine companies such as Bharat Biotech and Serum. The Delhi BJP, on the other hand, has defended itself by saying that the allegations are baseless.
Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Atishi made this revelation while speaking at a press conference. She said the government's vaccination campaign has stalled in many places across the country. But vaccinations at different rates continue in private hospitals. In India, Serum Institute's Covishield and Bharat Biotech's Covacin vaccines are currently available in India. A small amount of Russian-made Sputnik V is also being given.
This is a very big racket. Young people are vaccinated free of cost at government vaccination centers. There is a shortage of vaccines, but Atishi has alleged that vaccines are being given at a higher rate in private hospitals. Why is the central government not allowing emergency use of more vaccines? He has also raised such a question.
“Many countries around the world have allowed the use of different vaccines. The Pfizer vaccine is approved by 85 countries and the Moderna vaccine is approved by 46 countries. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been adopted by 41 countries. So why was the emergency use of only three vaccines approved in our own country? If the World Health Organization approves these vaccines, why doesn't India? "It is clear that the central government is creating an artificial shortage for the benefit of Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech," he alleged.
Although both these companies do not have production capacity, other vaccines are not allowed by the central government. The central government is ordering states to buy vaccines from only these two companies, she said.
Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor has denied the allegations. The allegations are baseless and the government has not created such a shortage. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's specialty is to create scarcity and inconvenience the common man.
Corona is an orphan; Many pets and birds are homeless!
Due to the economic crisis, people are not able to take care of the animals.
We have all been hit by the Corona epidemic since last year. Corona bereaved her loved ones, orphaned many, and inflicted severe wounds on many. This corona did not leave the animals alone. Many pets have also become homeless and orphaned during this period.
Animal rights activists say many have left their pets and birds on the streets during the epidemic, while others have left them in shelters and orphanages for animals.
Abhinav Shirhan, an animal rights activist from Delhi, says, "We have seen many people leave their pets, especially dogs and birds, outside shelter homes. The lockdown also alienated those who cared for them on the streets. So these animals and birds are very sick. ”
He further says, “It is becoming difficult to reach the animals through the police as the activists of the organizations working for the animals are also being stopped. While trying to rescue a dog, I was stopped by the Delhi Police and had to pay a fine of Rs 2,000 despite having all the documents.
Experts say that many people have to give up their animals because of the financial loss. In the same way, the housemaids who came to the society were not allowed to give animals to them as they were banned during this period. ”
Kaveri Rana Bharadwaj, a animal rights activist from Greater Noida, said, “It is very sad to see so many animals being orphaned and homeless during this time. I urge the authorities concerned to consider these animals as well. ”
Crisil Report: Bicycle industry booms in Ain Karonakala! The biggest increase in a decade!
During the lockdown period, the last fiscal year saw a sharp decline in the bicycle industry, while other industries in the country saw a sharp decline.
Everyone knows that the Corona crisis has been raging in the country for the last one year. During this period a large number of restrictions were imposed on the public life of the citizens. The lockdown forced billions of people to stay indoors. Many states still have more or less lockdown restrictions. Against this backdrop, while the graph of many other industries is coming down, the days of harvesting for the bicycle manufacturing industry in India have come. In the last financial year, during the Ain Corona lockdown , the demand for bicycles in the country has increased by 20%! This is the largest increase in the bicycle industry in the last decade, according to figures released by Crisil.
Fitness and free time!
According to Crisil, the demand for bicycles in the last financial year was around 12 million. However, in the current financial year, it will increase to 1 crore 45 lakhs. Crisil's report also found that public awareness of fitness and the large amount of free time spent at home during the Corona period contributed to this.
Demand for premium-kids bicycles increases!
The bicycles produced are generally classified into 4 types. There are four types: Standard, Premium, Kids and Export. Of these, standard bicycles account for about 50 per cent of the total demand. These types of bicycles are purchased directly from the government and distributed in various schemes. After that, the demand for premium and kids bicycles is around 40 per cent. Demand for this specialty has grown significantly as a result of fitness and leisure time. After this, the demand for export and other types of bicycles is 10 per cent.
… So the bicycle industry booms!
According to Crisil, two factors contributed to the rapid growth of the bicycle industry. One is that the demand for premium and kids type bicycles has increased by as much as 50 per cent. Secondly, the demand for premium and kids bicycles does not fluctuate much depending on their price. Therefore, even if the price of raw material like steel, which accounts for about 60 to 65 per cent of the cost of production, changes, the producers have no problem in increasing the cost. This has helped to grow the business of bicycle manufacturers as a whole.
Sales will increase as soon as the lockdown opens!
Meanwhile, sales of bicycles have not grown as much as expected as all shops are currently closed during the lockdown. However, Crisil predicts that sales will increase significantly in the next quarter, with the number of patients declining and the number of vaccinations increasing in the three months from April to June.
With the help of yoga many countries overcame the corona; Statement of Union Ministers
"Prime Minister Modi made the world aware of ancient customs"
Union AYUSH Minister Shripad Naik has said that the Modi government's global awareness on yoga has helped many countries to fight against Corona. He was speaking on the occasion of distribution of 'AYUSH' 64 medicine used for corona treatment at Naik Panaji on Friday.
"Narendra Modi's government started celebrating Yoga Day globally on June 21 seven years ago. This has created a lot of awareness among the people about yoga, ”said the Union Minister. Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant was also present on the occasion.
“Many countries now understand the importance of yoga in combating coronation. Because they have been informed about the benefits, ”said Naik. Calling Modi a visionary leader, he lauded him for awakening the world to the ancient tradition of focusing on the physical, mental and spiritual aspects of human life.
The state government is seeking the help of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy) doctors in the treatment of Kovid-19, said Chief Minister Sawant. "AYUSH clinics have also been set up in government health centers in the state, where other health problems are treated after recovery from covid," Sawant said.
Meanwhile, doctors from the Indian Medical Association had demanded action against yoga guru Ramdev Baba for making controversial statements about allopathy. Since then, Union ministers have said that yoga has helped countries around the world overcome the Corona.
"India is not great because of Modi, India has become infamous"
Today, people abroad do not even want to sit in the cars of Indian taxi drivers
Former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath visited the homes of health workers who died of corona infection while serving at the Corona Center in Maihar and consoled the relatives. Later, in a press conference held at the Circuit House, Kamal Nath targeted the central government and the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in the state. Kamal Nath criticized India today for not being a great country but a notorious country. Kamal Nath also referred to the refusal of Indian taxi drivers abroad to travel in their vehicles.
He also blamed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the central government under him for tarnishing the country's image and the country's reputation around the world. The Modi government will complete its seven-year term on May 30. On this occasion, the Modi government should answer to the people whether the country will run only on announcements. What happened to the job seekers? Kamal Nath demanded that the Center should give an answer as to what happened to inflation.
In a press conference, Kamal Nath directly accused the BJP and BJP supporters and said that a cowardly mafia has been formed in Madhya Pradesh. I started a war for the pure against the Corona Mafia. But today BJP leaders are selling ventilators, beds, injections. Getting the state out of the pit in which it is being pushed is challenging. 70% of Madhya Pradesh's economy is dependent on agriculture. But in the current situation, the economic condition of the middle class has become worrisome. The lower middle class has now become poorer and the situation of the poor has worsened, said Kamal Nath.
Kamal Nath blamed the Center and the state government for the Karona situation. The second wave had been known for months, but no preparations had been made. Vaccines were announced during the election period but were not received later. Tola Kamal Nath accused the Center and the state government of talking about global tenders.
When asked, an FIR is lodged if the truth is shown, said Kamal Nath. Why Shivraj does not keep all the statistics in front of the public. Why doesn't he openly say how many people have been vaccinated ?, asked Kamal Nath. While answering another question, BJP has not been given the contract of religion. We are also religious but we do not show off. Kamal Nath also said that if I go to any religious place, BJP's stomach starts hurting.
Bank employee arrives at office on oxygen support; Shocking type in PNB Bank
Alleged forcing her to work even when she was having trouble breathing
The inhuman face of Punjab National Bank has come to light in Bokaro, Jharkhand. An employee of PNB has accused the authorities of harassment. After recovering from coronation, he has been accused of forcing her to work even when she is having trouble breathing.
The incident took place at Punjab National Bank in Bokaro's Sector 4. Arvind Kumar, who works in a bank, was infected with corona a few days back. He said that he recovered after 10 days of fever. After recovering from it, he started having lung problems. They have been on oxygen support ever since. He has alleged that even in such a situation, the bank officials called him to work. They also had a dispute over salary. No one accepted him after he resigned out of frustration.
A video of Arvind Kumar, who lives in Sector 2, Bokaro, has gone viral on social media. He had gone to the bank with oxygen support after repeated calls by the bank. He was accompanied by his family. Arvind had put an oxygen mask on his face. He then shouted out his problems. The screams made it difficult for them to breathe. Arvind then asked the authorities for an answer but no one said anything.
Meanwhile, PNB Bank officials did not respond to a request for comment. Everyone was silent after the question was asked.
Where did the four crore vaccines go ?; Large differences in production and vaccination statistics
No dose of covacin has been given in 14 states and union territories
In India, the supply of corona vaccines is a matter of contention between the state and the center. In many states, the vaccination process is slow due to lack of adequate vaccines. However, questions are now being raised about the number of vaccines manufactured by Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad. There are reports of discrepancies in the total production and supply figures of covacin produced by Bharat Biotech.
According to official figures, 21 million doses of covacin were administered by Thursday morning. According to the Times of India, there are now more than six crore vaccines available in the country. It also counts the number of vaccines for export. As per the information given by Bharat Biotech on April 20, 1.5 crore doses were prepared in March. It also said that two crore doses would be produced by the month of April. Krishna Ella, the company's chief executive officer, said the company's revenue from vaccines would reach Rs 3 crore in May.
That is why the company did not produce vaccines as expected, but by the end of May, five and a half crore vaccines should have been available. According to information provided by the Center on two separate affidavits, two crore vaccines were produced in a month. One of the affidavits has been filed before the High Court on May 24. According to Ella, who started the vaccination campaign in the country on January 5, the company had stocks of two crore vaccines before the vaccination campaign started. Considering these vaccines too, the total number of vaccines goes up to one and a half crores.
Considering the vaccine production figures for January and February out of this Rs 7.5 crore, the total number of vaccines is around Rs 8 crore. Vaccine production was lower in January and February compared to March and April. Some of these vaccines were exported under vaccine diplomacy. However, India sent a total of 66 million doses of vaccines abroad. The highest dose of this was Covishield vaccine. Assuming that the dose of covacin is two crore, there should be six crore vaccines available in the country at present. However, it is said that only two crore vaccines are available. From all these addition and subtraction, it seems that the calculation of four crore doses is not clear.
Delhi is one of the leading vaccinators in the country, accounting for 31 per cent of the total vaccines. No dose of covacin has been given in 14 states and union territories of the country. The other five states have less than five per cent of the total vaccination of covacin vaccines.
Delhi's mission unlocked; Chief Minister Kejriwal's big decision
The lockdown will be lifted gradually with some restrictions
Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has said that the lockdown in Delhi will be lifted gradually in the wake of the Corona outbreak. He said the decision was taken as the number of corona patients in Delhi was declining.
He informed about this in a press conference today. The lockdown was prompted by the growing number of patients in Delhi. However, now that the number of patients is declining, the lockdown in Delhi will be phased out. "We are going to gradually remove the lockdown in Delhi on the advice of the people of Delhi and experts," Kejriwal said. However, this time the number of corona patients will increase again or not will be taken care of.
Chief Minister Kejriwal further said that the number of corona patients in Delhi is now declining drastically. In the last 24 hours, the incidence rate has come down to 1.5 per cent and about 1,100 patients have been found infected. The hard work of Delhiites in this battle against Corona is bearing fruit. The situation in Delhi is improving. And so Delhi is now ready to unlock. Construction sites and factories will start from Monday.
Kejriwal said, "We have to remember that the corona has just gone down, not gone." That is why we are slowly unlocking Delhi. Getting up at once can increase the risk of infection. For this unlock, we have put in front the wage earners, the poor people.
 Doctors, staff beaten to death after death of patient; Passing relatives carrying bodies
Shocking incident in the capital of Uttar Pradesh
Although the number of new patients with corona has decreased over the past few days in the second wave of corona, the number of deaths due to corona is worrying. The corona kills more than 3,000 people a day in the country. In some places relatives have been seen expressing anger at doctors after a patient died of coronary heart disease. In the last few months, there have been reports of attacks on doctors and vandalism of hospitals in different parts of the country. Recently, a case came to light in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh. At a hospital here, a young woman died of corona after her relatives beat up doctors. Not only that, but the relatives passed by throwing the body of this young woman in the car violating the rules regarding corona.
A man named Sunil Mishra had taken his wife Shaila Mishra to the Advanced Neuro and General Hospital in Lucknow for treatment. Shaila's condition was so worrying that after her test, her CT score was between 25 and 22. In such a situation, Shaila was earlier refused admission. However, according to the rules for admitting corona patients, the doctors treated Shaila. However, Shaila died on May 25. After receiving the news of Shaila's death, her relatives went to the hospital and caused a commotion. The relatives beat up the doctors, cleaners and nurses at the hospital. They also argued with the hospital receptionist. Considering the seriousness of the case, the hospital administration called the police.
According to the hospital administration, police arrived at the spot but did not take any action. The hospital administration alleged that the police were only standing and watching the incident and the relatives of the patient were making a fuss. The shocking thing is that after such a commotion, the relatives took Shaila's body out of the car with them. Shaila's body was not sealed according to Corona rules. However, his relatives violated all the rules and took the body and fled the scene. Police have registered a case against Shaila's relatives in this regard. A case has been registered against 24 people for assaulting a doctor and police have launched an investigation. Police are investigating with the help of CCTV.
The hospital administration claimed that many of Shaila's relatives had been drinking. It is said that these people beat him up under the influence of alcohol. The hospital staff said that after 13 days, they threatened to come again and beat us up.

Why are so many children dying in this country because of covid?
It has been more than a year since the coronation began.
However, the situation is not under control.
Corona deaths are currently on the rise in Brazil.
There is ample evidence that the corona virus reduces the mortality rate of young children and adolescents.
But the situation is a little different in Brazil.
Corona has so far killed 1,300 children in Brazil.
A doctor had refused to see Jessica Ricerte's one-year-old son.
He said at the time that the child's symptoms did not match Corona's.
But within the next two months, the boy died of coronary heart disease.
Jessica, who is a teacher, had a miscarriage after two years of infertility treatment.
She says, "Our child was a ray of hope for us.
He brought light into our dark lives.
He gave us so much joy that we never imagined."
Jessica's son was named Lucas.
Lucas first had a problem with loss of appetite.
He used to eat well.
At first, Jessica thought that this was likely to happen because of teething.
Then Lucas began to have a fever.
He started having trouble breathing.
Problems increased by not testing the covid
Jessica took Lucas to the hospital.
According to Jessica, the doctors checked the oxygen level in Lucas' body.
This level had dropped to 86 percent.
It was then that I realized that things were going well.
Lucas didn't have much fever.
The doctor said, "Don't worry.
Covid doesn't need to be tested.
He's having a sore throat."
Doctors told Jessica that covid-19 is extremely rare in young children.
The doctor gave Jessica some antibiotics and sent her home.
“We completed a 10-day course of antibiotics prescribed by a doctor,” says Jessica.
On the last day, Lucas' symptoms subsided.
But his fatigue persisted.
This made me more concerned about the corona virus.
“I sent several videos of him to his nurses, relatives, mother-in-law and others,” she says.
But many told me that I was thinking too much.
They advised me to avoid watching the news.
They thought that I was afraid of all these things for no reason.
But I knew my son was really having trouble breathing.
This is the story of May 2020.
By then, the corona virus had begun to spread.
Two people were killed in the city of Sierra in the Tamboril area in northeastern Brazil.
At that time, the whole city was shocked.
Jessica's husband, Israel, feared that Lucas and Jessica could be infected with the corona if they were taken to another hospital.
But for the next few weeks, Lucas slept a little more.
Finally, on June 3, after the meal, Lucas began to vomit again and again.
Jessica was rushed to a local hospital for a corona test.
His nurse said he tested positive for corona.
MIS status in most children
The hospital did not even have a rescuer at the time, Jessica said.
Lucas was sent to the pediatric intensive care unit in Sobral.
It was two hours away.
After moving there, Lucas realized that he was suffering from Multi-System Syndrome (MIS).
MIS is a condition in which your immune system is active beyond its limits.
This causes swelling in the vital organs.
According to experts, this condition is more likely to develop in children over six weeks of age after a corona infection.
But it is also said to be extremely rare.
Dr. who works as an accompanying pathologist at the University of So Paulo.
They have seen the most cases of MIS during corona outbreaks.
However, in all the cases, the children did not die, he said.
When Lucas was admitted to the hospital, Jessica was not allowed to stay in his room.
Jessica called her niece there.
She says, "We could hear the beep-beep of the machine.
The sound kept coming until the machine stopped.
It predicted the death of the person.
The machine stopped for a few minutes and started again.
We both started crying when we saw it."
Lucas had a heart attack.
But he was rescued, doctors said.
Pediatrician Dr. Manuela Monte had treated Lucas in Sobral's ICU for a month.
Lucas's condition was very serious.
But I was worried about him because there was no reason for him to have such serious symptoms, she said.
According to Lohona Tavarez, a pediatrician at the Albert Sabin Children's Hospital in Fortaleza, the state capital, the majority of children infected with corona have other illnesses, such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity.
But that was not the case with Lucas.
Lucas remained in the ICU for 33 days.
Jessica was only able to meet him 3 times during that period.
Lucas needed immunoglobulin medication to treat his heart.
This drug is very expensive.
But fortunately one patient gave a dose of this medicine to the hospital.
Lucas was in critical condition and needed another dose of immunoglobulin.
Red spots began to appear on his body now.
He developed a fever.
He needed an artificial system to breathe.
Lucas' health improved slightly.
He began to breathe on his own.
So the doctor removed the tube.
After regaining consciousness, he made a video call to Jessica and Israel so that Lucas would not feel alone.
“He started crying when he heard our voices,” Jessica said.
That was our son's last reaction to our talk.
In the next video call, however, he felt as if all the energy in the boy was gone.
The doctor told us to have a CT scan.
It turned out that Lucas had a stroke.
Jessica-Israel, on the other hand, was told that Lucas' health was improving.
He will be taken out of the ICU and placed in the general ward, doctors said.
Jessica says, "I kept my mobile silent that day.
Lucas came in my dream too.
He was kissing my nose.
It was a feeling of love and devotion for me.
I woke up very happy the next day.
Doctors said after Jessica's call, "Lucas's heartbeat and oxygen levels were dropping very fast.
Awareness from Jessica
Jessica still thinks that if Lucas had undergone a covid test in May after his first visit to the hospital, he would be alive today.
Corona, Brazil
She says, "If the doctor doesn't confirm that you have covid, you should have a corona test to confirm it.
Lucas's health deteriorated to such an extent that it was only because of the delay in proper treatment.
Dr. "It's very difficult to stop MIS," says Monte.
Jessica is now raising awareness by telling the story of Lucas.
I would have been more careful if I had known, she said.
How low is the risk of covid in young children?
Dr. Fatima Marinho says, "There is a misconception that there is no risk of covid in young children.
A report has found that young children also have a high incidence of corona infection.
According to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, between February 2020 and March 15, 2020, Kovid-19 killed 852 children under the age of 9 and 518 children under the age of one.
Dr. According to Mourinho, the figure could double.
Meanwhile, deaths due to unspecified acute respiratory syndrome have also increased compared to last year.
The corona virus has claimed the lives of 2,060 children under the age of 9, including 1,302 children.
What is the reason for this?
Experts believe that the number of corona infections in the country is higher because of the high incidence of corona infection in children in Brazil.
Renato Cafuri, president of the Scientific Department of Immunization at the Brazilian Society of Pediatrics, says, "Our country has a high incidence of coronary heart disease.
The number of corona sufferers was second only to the number of days Brazil went to before India overtook them.
There is a shortage of oxygen in the whole country.
There is also a shortage of medicines.
Many hospitals in the country are short of ICU beds.
Brazilian President Zaire Bolsonaro has opposed the lockdown.
A new variant called P.1 has also been found in the country.
This variant is considered more contagious.
Corona deaths have more than doubled in the past few days compared to the first wave of the epidemic.
The prevalence of corona in young children has increased due to less testing.
Mourinho says young children become aware of their corona infection only after they become seriously ill.
There are difficulties in identifying patients.
Not testing the right amount.
This leads to late detection of infection.
As a result, treatment is delayed. "
The lack of tests alone is not the only reason why children develop coronary heart disease.
But other problems that are found in children, different symptoms at different ages also cause many problems.
She says, "In addition to the symptoms of normal covid, children have problems with diarrhea.
They have pain in the abdomen and chest.
Moreover, poverty and lack of health facilities are also considered as a factor.
A study was conducted on 5,857 coronaviruses under the age of 20 years.
Other illnesses and socio-economic problems are also a factor in the deaths of children from corona.
Most of the patients are from black and poor families.
Help cannot reach them.
These children are at high risk of death.
People living in small houses do not observe social distance.
They do not have access to ICUs early, Marinho said.
In addition, these children are more prone to malnutrition.
Therefore, these children have very low immunity.
Mourinho says, "Covid has caused a lot of financial hardship.
In one year, 7 million to 2.1 million people could fall below the poverty line.
People are suffering from malnutrition.
Brian Susa of the Sओo Paulo School of Medicine has done some research on this.
According to him, a group of children is at higher risk of corona.
This should be considered when vaccinating covid.
There is currently no vaccination system for children under 16 years of age.
Death in the absence of parents is unfortunate
Relatives cannot visit children in the ICU for fear of corona infection.
Cinera Kaineiro says, "This situation is very challenging.
Only parents can tell their children how they feel.
Only parents can understand their children's grief.
Parents are very stressed when they hear about their children's health.
They want to spend time with their children.
It is very unfortunate that children die in the absence of their parents, said Dr. Carneiro thinks.
According to scientists, the risk of death in children in this age group is still extremely low.
According to current statistics, 3 lakh 45 thousand people have died due to corona in Brazil so far.
Of these, 0.58 per cent are in the age group of zero to 9 years.
That number is more than 2,000.
Corona: Why do Indians go to Nepal to get the Chinese vaccine?
April 14, 2021 Medical staff at Teku Hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal's capital, were shocked to learn of some of the people who had come to get the vaccine.
These people had big bags.
Sagar Raj Bhandari, director of Teku Hospital, told BBC Nepali: "It is because of these people that we know that corona vaccine is being used like this.
In a way, it is like abusing corona vaccine.
We told them that we cannot vaccinate you.
Some even put pressure on us in various ways. "
The Chinese embassy in Nepal said on its website that visas are issued by China to those who have been vaccinated in China.
Nepali officials suspect that Indian businessmen are coming to Nepal to get business visas to do business with Chinese companies and injecting Chinese-made vaccines.
Covacin and covshield vaccine are being produced in India.
Russia's Sputnik V vaccine has also been allowed in India for emergency use.
India has set an age limit for vaccination.
The vaccine is not made available to everyone.
Dev Chandra Lal Karna, spokesperson of Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport, said that a large number of Indians have been arriving in Kathmandu in the last few days.
Indians are allowed to travel from Nepal to other countries.
It requires a no-objection certificate.
Many Indian travelers have such letters, says Dev Chandra Lal Karna.
At present, only two airlines are operating in India and Nepal.
It has also been asked to continue with the air bubble system.
Air traffic between Nepal and China continues.
The number of no-objection certificates issued by the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu has increased in the last few days.
What is the status of vaccination in Nepal?
In Nepal, people between the ages of 40 and 59 are being vaccinated between March 31 and April 19, 2021.
In addition, people who travel to China for business or family reasons or for medical reasons are also vaccinated.
According to the Government of Nepal, more than 50,000 people have been vaccinated in the first 10 days.
Joint Spokesperson of the Health Department of the Government of Nepal, Dr. Sameer Kumar Adhikari said, "Initially, we had asked people to see their identity cards.
Now, the district health officer has been told in writing that the inquiry into identity cards should be made mandatory."
Meanwhile, Nepali officials have said that Indians living in Nepal and involved in small businesses here will be vaccinated.
Corona: Nawab Malik says Center orders companies not to supply drugs to Maharashtra
NCP spokesperson and minister Nawab Malik has strongly accused the central government of ordering companies not to supply medicines to Maharashtra.
Nawab Malik has made these allegations through social media.
Nawab Malik said, "When the Maharashtra government asked about 16 exporting companies about Remedesivir, they got shocking information.
The central government had ordered these companies not to supply drugs to Maharashtra.
In today's scenario, the Maharashtra government will have no choice but to confiscate the stock of remedicivir from these companies and deliver it to the needy, Nawab Malik said.
After these serious allegations of Nawab Malik, reactions have started coming from Maharashtra BJP.
BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhyay said, "Instead of making such baseless allegations, Nawab Malik should give evidence if he has any.
Is the allegation made by Nawab Malik the role of the Maharashtra government?
If so, then Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray should come forward and clarify the truth.
Or these ministers should be stopped from making irresponsible and baseless allegations.
Meanwhile, it will be important to see how the central government reacts to Nawab Malik's allegations.
At present, there are signs that the allegations between the BJP and the Mahavikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra are about to change.
Corona: Actor Sonu Sood positive, gave a 'yes' message to the fans
Actor Sonu Sood has contracted the corona virus.
Sonu Sood tweeted, "Hello friends, I want to let you know that my corona test came back positive.
So I quarantined myself."
Also, "There is no reason to worry.
On the contrary, I will have more time to solve your problems.
Remember, if there is any problem, I am with you," Sonu added.
Sonu Sood actor's leader?
Meanwhile, after the nationwide lockdown was announced last year, many extended a helping hand to the needy in various ways.
But the most talked about was the relief work done by actor Sonu Sood.
Sonu was praised for her words in movies, from villain to real life.
But Sonu Sood's help is now in dispute.
For the past two months, actor Sonu Sood has been working to bring home workers trapped in Mumbai due to a lockdown.
Sonu sent home workers from Bihar, Assam, Uttar Pradesh and many other states.
People tweet to Sonu Sood for help.
Many have even tweeted a list of people going out of town.
Even when the government did not start trains, Sonu Sood was planning a bus to send the workers home.
Sonu's 'film' career
Sonu Sood has worked in Hindi, English, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Punjabi and Chinese cinema.
He started his career in 1999 with the Tamil film 'Kallazhagar'.
Sonu Sood is originally from Punjab and has been living in Mumbai for the last few years.
His father had a business and his mother was a professor.
Sonu graduated from the Engineering College, Nagpur.
Sonu then moved to Mumbai to work in modeling and cinema.
The struggle for a job started in Mumbai.
At that time, Sonu was struggling to get a job in cinema.
But Sonu got her first opportunity in Delhi for an advertisement.
He then landed a role in Tamil cinema.
He then started acting in Tamil, Telugu and Kannada movies.
For that he had to learn these languages.
Sonu made her Bollywood debut in 2002 with the Hindi film Shahid-e-Azam.
After that, he acted in some Hindi movies like Yuva, Aashiq Banaya Aapne, Shoot Out At Wadala, Jodha Akbar, Dabangg, Happy New Year, Paltan, R Rajkumar.
Work in Chinese cinema
Sonu Sood has also acted in Chinese language movies.
Sonu has acted in the movie 'Kung Fu Yoga' in 2017.
For this, he had trained in China with Jackie Chan's son.
Jackie Chan along with Sonu had also done promotions in India for this movie.
In 1996, Sonu married his girlfriend Sonali.
Sonu and Sonali met while studying in Nagpur.
They have two children, Ishant and Ayan.
This is not his first social work, though it has come to light thanks to the help of actor Sonu Sood
Sonu also provides financial assistance to victims of acid attacks.
He has been receiving treatment and helping his family.
Moreover, he also helps the poor in gurdwaras.
Madhu Pal, a journalist covering Bollywood, said, "Sonu Sood always behaves in a simple manner.
If there are journalists and photographers outside his house, he invites them home.
He also invites journalists standing under the house to cover Ganeshotsav.
His nature has always remained the same."
Why are the tweets of Sonu's Twitter account being deleted?
If anyone wants to return home from outside the state, that person tweets Sonu Sood.
Seeing the tweet, Sonu also replies that 'you will be home tomorrow'.
But now it has been revealed that many tweets are missing from Sonu Sood's Twitter handle.
A visit to his Twitter account reveals that many people had tweeted but now they have been deleted.
However, Sonu's reply is the same.
Political debate
Hundreds of laborers have been evacuated even under adverse conditions, prompting allegations that Sonu Sood's help was politically motivated.
Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut has said that Sonu Sood will be seen as the BJP's star campaigner in the elections.
In the Shiv Sena's mouthpiece 'Saamana', Sanjay Raut has raised questions about Sonu's relief work.
Sonu Sood is a good actor.
What he is doing is good.
But there is a possibility of a 'political director' behind it, Raut said.
This is the beginning of a political debate.
Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam on Sanjay Raut's objections to Sonu Sood's work
Has retaliated.
Instead of praising him with a big heart, Shiv Sena is criticizing him.
Nirupam tweeted that there is no need to go to such a low level to hide our failure on the part of migrant workers.
Manesena has also jumped into this controversy.
What did you do beyond writing the headline? This question has been asked by MNS Chitrapat Sena president Ameya Khopkar.
Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council Pravin Darekar said that Shiv Sena's criticism is an attempt to stay in the discussion.
Sonu Sood had met Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari a few days back.
After the criticism from 'Samana', Sonu also met Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.
Sonu also mentioned this in one of her tweets.
Many people delete a tweet by requesting a tweet.
Therefore, it is estimated that many people's tweets are fake, Sonu said in her tweet.
Sonu's political affiliation
In 2018, the then Forest Minister and BJP leader Sudhir Munganti had attended one of its events.
Sonu Sood was present at the Guardian Minister's Cup prize giving ceremony at Chandrapur.
He handed out prizes to the winners.
Sonu had also met Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh a few days back.
He tweeted his photos.
But according to reporters covering Bollywood, Sonu Sood was never interested in politics
I don't think Sonu Sood will go into politics.
He has no political affiliation with anyone.
Even if he gets offers, I don't think Sonu will accept.
He is satisfied as an actor, journalist Parag Chhapekar told BBC Marathi.
Bollywood journalist Pooja Samant thinks that there is a politics behind this.
Speaking to BBC Marathi, she said, "Sonu's work is appreciated.
But we can't say what the political threads may be behind the scenes.
But the Shiv Sena's criticism of Sonu Sood cannot be ruled out.
Even though Sonu Sood has done independently what he did not get despite being the Shiv Sena's chief minister, the Shiv Sena may have a problem.
Political controversy is likely to start as he is getting all the credit, said Pooja Samant.
Sonu Sood's name in Cobra Post's sting
During the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Cobra Post claimed to have 'exposed' some celebrities.
It also had gold interest.
At that time, Sonu Sood was also the goodwill ambassador of the Modi government's 'HumFitTohIndiaFit' campaign.
At the time, Sonu Sood was reportedly ready to post on social media handles that the BJP would benefit, according to a report in the Cobra Post.
Attempts are being made to misinterpret it by cutting it out in editing. "
Corona virus: What are the symptoms of Covid-19 in children?
The second wave of Covid 19 also increased the risk of coronavirus infection in young children.
Symptoms appear in children during this wave of infection.
During the first wave of corona virus, the incidence of covid-19 in young children or adolescents was low.
But during the second wave, the number of patients under the age of 18 seems to have increased.
Experts say that the new strains of the corona virus, the declining number of patients, the children being out of the house to play, the offices started by the adults in the house and the resulting travel are the reasons behind this number of patients.
What are the symptoms of corona virus in children?
In addition to the usual fever and sore throat, children with corona virus have other symptoms.
Pediatricians say that these symptoms are similar to the usual stomach upset and vomiting in children.
So keep in mind that if a child has a stomach upset or pain, vomiting can also be associated with corona.
If children who are unable to speak are constantly irritated, crying uncontrollably, or suffering, this may be a sign of pain in their limbs.
Consulting Pediatrician of Bombay Hospital Dr. Mukesh Sankalecha has a study on infectious diseases in children.
Talking to BBC Marathi about the symptoms found in children, Dr. "Children are more likely to be infected with the corona by their parents or family members.
Most of the children have mild symptoms.
Some have been diagnosed with high fever.
Children will not be able to tell if the taste in the mouth has gone or the smell has stopped.
But a sudden loss of appetite for children may be a sign that they are eating less.
But children recover quickly.
Young children are not allowed to be admitted to the ICU like adults. "
Common symptoms
Heat
Dry cough, sore throat
Shortness of breath
Taste in the mouth, stop smelling
Different symptoms found in young children in the second wave
Stomach upset
Vomiting
Headache
Fainting
Persistent irritability, harassment (even in young children)
Acne
Red eyes
Bluish covering of fingernails or toenails.
This is called 'Covid Toes'.
When to test children's covid?
Dr. "If one of the parents is positive, the child is more likely to be positive, because even the youngest children are around the parents, especially the mother.
We focus on testing the adults, because if their health deteriorates, their treatment may need to change," says Sanklecha.
When it comes to young children, most children do not need a separate treatment.
So there is no serious need for their testing.
But often parents also test their children when there are no symptoms so that things can be clear.
Although the test was positive, the children did not need much treatment.
But if a child goes out and plays and goes to a friend's house, their parents are at risk of contracting the corona virus. "
Children's corona test
But if the child shows symptoms, they should be tested.
Precautions to be taken if children have symptoms
If children have a fever, keep them at home.
Do not send to play when the fever subsides.
The fever may be due to climate change, but it may also be a symptom of corona virus infection.
Contact a doctor immediately.
Do not leave the house if children have corona-like symptoms.
Many doctors have once again started consulting through video calls.
Taking a child to a clinic with symptoms of corona can be dangerous for other children.
Go to the clinic only if the doctor calls for a physical examination.
If a child develops a fever or other symptoms, make a neat chart and record it.
Keep records of date, time, fever, SPO2 (blood oxygen level), pulse rate every 7-8 hours, about three times a day (morning - afternoon - night).
If children are moving their hands, check that the pulse oximeter is sitting on their finger properly
Contact your family doctor / pediatrician immediately if the oxygen level on SPO2 is below 94.
If a child is positive, it is difficult to keep them in a room for quarantine.
If there are grandparents in such a house, they are also at risk of getting this infection.
In this case, the grandparents should be confined to one room for this period, they should be quarantined in one room, and the child should be allowed to roam in the house.
If a baby or toddler falls ill, one of the parents should take care of him.
This can reduce the risk of corona infection spreading to other members of the household.
A parent with a sick baby should wear a mask.
If the sick child is older than 2 years, they should also wear a mask.
Although the incidence of corona symptoms has increased in children, doctors say there is no need to panic as children recover faster.
What if the breastfeeding mother is positive?
This can be decided by talking to your baby's doctor.
But if the woman has mild symptoms, she can wear a mask and breastfeed.
If your baby is younger than 6 months, ask your doctor if it can be quarantined with the mother.
This is because when the mother breastfeeds the baby and gives it back to the grandparents or other family members outside the room, the infection is more likely to spread among the seniors in the house.
Dr. Mukesh Sankalecha says, "Breastfeeding should be continued even after the mother is positive.
And the nutritional benefits of breastfeeding are many times greater than this small risk."
Take this precaution:
External massage to massage small babies can be a means of infection.
Therefore, on the advice of a doctor, massage the baby at home for some time.
Keep baby soap, combs and other things separate.
Wash hands before feeding, feeding, or changing baby clothes.
If using a car, sanitize the car from time to time.
Sanitize children's toys.
Ask the children to sing 'Happy Birthday' twice while washing their hands so that they have enough time to wash their hands.
Do not give multivitamin medications or protein powders directly to children.
Start supplements on the advice of a doctor.
This is because the amount of medication varies according to the age and weight of the child. E.g. Doctors determine a child's daily intake of zinc or vitamin-C based on his / her age and weight.
What is MIS-C?
MIS-C stands for Multi-Inflammatory Syndrome in Kids.
Mumbai-based pediatrician Dr. Gitanjali Shah says, "Symptoms of this syndrome appear in young children 2 to 4 weeks after the onset of covid 19.
These children have antibodies to covid in their body and this condition occurs due to over-activation of their immune system.
This story is very rare so parents do not have to panic.
But they should know about it.
It is important to remember that this can happen.
So don't go for less that your full potential. "
These include inflammation of vital organs in children, stomach upset, abdominal pain, vomiting, acne, red eyes, fever, and redness of the tongue and throat.
It can affect the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, eyes, skin, stomach and intestines.
These symptoms are similar to those found in children with Kawasaki syndrome.
Kawasaki syndrome is found in children under 5 years of age.
MIS-C needs immediate treatment.
For this, if the child has these symptoms, it is necessary to tell the doctor whether he has got covid in the past.
If the child's covid has not been tested, give the doctor an idea of ​​if anyone in the household has had a covid positive some time ago and as a result the child is also likely to be asymptomatic during this period.
If the symptoms in the child are not related to any other disorder, the child may have been diagnosed with covidosis by an antibody test.
Dr. "A few months ago, we had a 12-year-old boy who was admitted to the hospital.
In those previous months, he did not have any problems.
He had to be admitted.
We checked his covid antibodies but he had a lot of antibodies in his body.
Such symptoms require immediate treatment.
Otherwise, it can lead to heart failure and can be fatal. "
Various drug companies around the world have started testing vaccines for this age group.
During the tests, the vaccine proved to be 100 percent effective for the 12- to 15-year-olds, and Pfizer said at the end of March that it had a good immune system.
The test was performed on 2,260 children in the United States. Pfizer - Bioentech vaccine will now be tested on children under 12 years of age.
AstraZeneca has also announced that it will conduct vaccine tests in the UK between the ages of 6 and 17.
Corona virus: What are the symptoms? How to protect from Covid-19?
There are three main symptoms of corona virus.
Even if one of these starts to bother, testing is necessary.
The second wave of corona virus is seen in many places around the world.
Therefore, it is necessary to immediately identify and test the symptoms of corona virus.
What are the symptoms of corona virus?
Non-stop cough - Sometimes this cough can last for more than an hour.
Or a cough may occur three or more times in 24 hours.
Fever - Body temperature 37.8C is higher than 100.4F
Changing the taste in the mouth , the ability to smell - your mouth tastes completely gone, things don't smell.
Or it may seem different.
According to a recent survey by the ONS, people who are infected with the new variant of the Corona experience more severe coughing and sore throat, fatigue and muscle aches than those who are infected with the older variant.
It is important to get tested as soon as any of these symptoms appear.
Also do not leave the house for any reason until the test report is received.
It is advisable for your family or roommates to stay home until the test results are available.
According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), colds, nausea, muscle aches, and sore throats can also be symptoms of corona virus infection.
It takes about 5 days from the onset of infection to the onset of symptoms.
But sometimes it can be up to 14 days, according to the World Health Organization.
If your test is positive, the person should stay in isolation and consult a doctor for further procedures.
Others in the household also need to be quarantined.
Here's what to look for and tactics to help ease the way .

Read on for more information - What are the symptoms of Covid-19 in children? What is MIS-C?
What to do if covid test is positive?
If the covid test is positive, your lab informs you as well as the health system.
After receiving this information, the local health system or the municipality will contact you.
But until then, it is important that you stay in isolation.
The family of a positive person should also be quarantined.
If the symptoms of a positive person are mild and there are no other disorders, they can stay at home for 10 days in isolation as advised by the doctor and the health system.
Medication should be taken at home on the advice of a doctor.
Corona caution
Other members of the household should not leave the house to stay away from others for 10 days.
Here you can read about what to look for in a home isolation or home quarantine .
If you have mild symptoms, you may feel better by taking a medicine like paracetamol, taking plenty of rest and fluids.
But for this, you should not go out to go to the General Practitioner - Family Doctor or Chemist.
The doctor can give you advice over the phone.
But if the positive person has moderate or severe symptoms, they will be admitted to the covid center or hospital as per the advice of the health system.
When should people go to the hospital?
Most people infected with the corona virus have been cured of body aches, colds and fevers with paracetamol.
But, when breathing becomes difficult, the level of oxygen in the body decreases, then you should go to the hospital immediately.
The doctor then takes an X-ray of the patient's chest to see how much phlegm has accumulated in the chest.
It is then decided whether to supply the patient with oxygen or to place him directly on the ventilator.
If you have difficulty breathing, call the National Helpline number for Covid-19 immediately.
Or you can call 1075.
Also, the pathology report revealed that the corona was obstructed.
What do you do if you have symptoms of corona virus?
What exactly happens in the ICU?
Extremely critically ill patients are treated in the ICU.
Patients with corona get oxygen through oxygen masks.
If it is not possible for the patient, a tube is also delivered to the nose.
If a patient's condition worsens, he is placed on a ventilator in the ICU.
A tube is inserted directly into the body through the nose or mouth.
A large amount of oxygen is delivered directly to the lungs through this tube.
You will find detailed information about the ventilator in the next news.
What are ventilators? Why are they so important in the battle of Corona?
How to protect from corona?
Recent research has shown that the corona virus is spread through small drops that come out of a cough or sneeze, or when a hand touches the area where the drops fall, touching the nose and mouth.
Also, experts have repeatedly said that the risk of such an infection is high in crowded places.
To prevent corona infection, do the following regularly -
Don't go too close to sick people.
Do not touch mouth, nose, eyes, ears without washing hands.
Use tissue paper when sneezing and coughing.
Wash hands regularly with soap.
The WHO has yet to say for sure whether the use of masks can actually prevent corona.
But if you are going to a crowded place then definitely use it.
Older people or people with pre-existing respiratory asthma, diabetes and heart disease are more likely to become seriously ill if they are infected with the corona virus.
Treatment of such patients helps them to breathe and tries to boost the body's immunity.
Corona virus vaccines are now available in many countries.
If you come in contact with an infected person, you should be separated from others for a few days.
Such people should also avoid going out of the house for doctors or medicines.
Inform the local health care officer or municipal staff after you have any symptoms.
If you are positive, you need to have a contact tracing of who came in contact with you.
If symptoms appear, do not wait until the report is received.
Vaccination campaigns are underway in many countries of the world, including India, to curb the global outbreak of Covid 19.
Information about this vaccine, from time to time, may confuse you.
So here are some important things that can help you understand how a vaccine works.
What is a vaccine?
Vaccines teach your body how to fight an illness or a viral infection.
A vaccine is made using a weak or inactive fraction of a virus that causes a disease.
This allows the immune system to recognize the virus that has entered the body and to make antibodies to fight it.
Very few people have the negative or side effects of the vaccine, while some people have the side effects of the vaccine.
Many get a slight fever or rash after being vaccinated.
Vaccines teach your body how to fight an illness or a viral infection.
Immediately after the injection, your body begins to develop an immune system to fight the disease.
Medications treat the disease.
But the vaccine is more effective because it prevents the spread of a disease, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Is the vaccine safe?
Researchers in China discovered the early stage vaccine in the 10th century.
But in 1796, during the company of the goddess, Edward Jenner made a great discovery.
There is a dose of mild infection of the goddess, they found that it protects the goddess from serious infections.
He did research on it, tested his own theories And two years later, their findings were published.
The word vaccine was born at the same time.
It is related to the Latin word Vacca meaning cow.
Vaccines are considered an important discovery in modern medicine.
The World Health Organization estimates that the vaccine kills between two and three million people each year.
The CDC said that the vaccine was being thoroughly tested before it was brought to the market.
It is first tested in a laboratory and then in animals.
This was followed by a human trial of the vaccine.
The disease of the Goddess, which has claimed the lives of millions around the world, has now been eradicated from the world.
The disease of the Goddess, which has claimed the lives of millions around the world, has now been eradicated from the world.
In most countries, vaccinations are started after permission from local drug regulators.
Like other drugs, vaccines carry some risks.
But given the benefits, the risks are small.
For instance, a generation has been vaccinated against the common diseases of childhood.
The disease of the Goddess, which has claimed the lives of millions around the world, has now been eradicated from the world.
But it takes decades to succeed.
Africa was declared polio-free 30 years after vaccination began.
But this period is too long.
Experts warn that it will take months or even years for adequate vaccinations for Covid 19 to occur worldwide, after which life may return to normal.
How are vaccines made?
When a new pathogen, such as a bacterium, virus, parasite or fungus, enters the body, it is called a sub-part of the body, the antigen.
And to fight it, the body begins to make antibodies.
Vaccines contain some weak or inactive components of a bacterium that causes disease.
The vaccine helps to identify the virus that is attacking the body's immune system.
And the body makes antibodies to prevent this attack from outside.
And the body develops immunity against that disease.
New methods are now being used to develop vaccines.
Some of the vaccines on the corona have been developed with similar new methods.
Comparison of covid 19 vaccines
Pfizer - Bioentech and Modern's Covid vaccine are both Messenger RNA vaccines.
A portion of the virus's genetic code is used to create this.
Instead of using the weak or inactive part of the antigen, the vaccine teaches the body how to make the spike protein found on the surface of the virus that causes covid 19.
Covid vaccine comparison
The Oxford and AstraZeneca vaccines are different.
In India it is available under the name Kovishield.
To make this vaccine, some changes were made to a virus that infected chimpanzees, and a part of the genetic code of the corona virus was added to it.
All three vaccines have been approved for use in emergencies by some countries around the world, including the United States and Britain.
What other vaccines are there?
Chinese drug company Synovac has developed a vaccine called 'Coronovac'.
The vaccine is available in China, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.
The vaccine has been developed in the traditional way using the inactive part of the virus.
But questions have been raised about how effective the vaccine is.
The vaccine was tested in Turkey, Indonesia and Brazil.
Researchers had said that the vaccine was only 50.4 percent effective.
Two vaccines have been developed in India.
Oxford - AstraZeneca vaccine is available in India under the name Covishield.
The vaccine is produced by the Serum Institute of India in Pune.
The second vaccine is a covacin made by an Indian company called Bharat Biotech.
Russia has developed its own vaccine called Sputnik-5.
The vaccine was developed by modifying the virus.
The same vaccine is used in Argentina.
Argentina has ordered 3 million doses of the vaccine for their vaccination.
The African Union has also ordered millions of doses of the vaccine.
Pfizer, AstraZeneca (via the Serum Institute) and Johnson & Johnson have been ordered to vaccinate.
Should I get vaccinated?
Vaccination for Covid 19 is not mandatory.
But it is recommended that as many people as possible get the vaccine.
Exceptions are made for people with health problems.
The CDC says the vaccine will protect not only you but others from covid 19.
Moreover, it is an effective way to curb global warming.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says at least 65 to 70 percent of the world's population needs to be vaccinated to control the disease.
This means that more people need to be motivated to get vaccinated.
But the speed with which the vaccine for Covid 19 has been developed has raised doubts in the minds of many.
While it would take ERV researchers several years to develop a vaccine, this research has been accelerated to find a solution to the coronary artery.
The World Health Organization is working with researchers, companies and health organizations from around the world.
In short, after the vaccination of billions of people, the infection of Covid 19 will stop and the world's herd immunity will increase.
Experts say that this is the way life in the world can be restored.
Corona vaccine: Why is there a gap of 6 to 8 weeks between two doses?
In India, the Covid-19 vaccine is currently given to citizens over 45 years of age.
About 8.7 crore people have been given the first dose of the vaccine so far, according to government figures.
It was earlier decided that there should be an interval of 4 to 6 weeks between the two doses of Covishield vaccine.
But scientific research has shown that the difference between the two doses of covshield vaccine has been increased to six to eight weeks.
This time limit is for covachield only, not for covacin.
But one question is many, why do I have to wait a few days to get another dose?
Before finding the answer to this question, let's find out how vaccines provide protection.
After taking the first dose of the vaccine, it takes a few days for the body to produce antibodies.
Antibodies are slowly formed after the first dose.
It is the body's primary immune system.
But after the second dose, which is called a booster dose, your immune system works faster.
There are also some side effects.
This is a sign that the vaccine is working.
After taking the second dose, not only do antibodies build up in the body, but the body stimulates the lymph nodes as well as other organs to respond.
In many countries, the difference between the two doses is two to three months.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended a two-and-a-half month interval between two doses of covshield vaccine.
There is a debate in many countries as to whether this gap should be short or long.
The British Medical Association says that there should be a gap of 6 weeks between the two doses of Pfizer vaccine, not 12 weeks.
In February, the medical journal The Lancet reported that the Covishield vaccine, produced by the Serum Institute in Pune, is 55.1% effective if the two doses are less than 6 weeks apart, and 81.3% if two doses are given 12 weeks apart. Was found.
In India, the gap is now 6 to 8 weeks.
What is the reason for this? How much of a difference can there be between two doses of vaccine?
Can corona be infected after taking the first dose of vaccine?
The possibility of this cannot be ruled out and therefore you should continue to carefully follow all the instructions given to prevent infection.
Use of masks, social distance etc.
Infection can occur even after a second dose of the vaccine, but it is extremely mild and less likely to be hospitalized.
A second dose is needed because many vaccines work at full capacity only after a booster dose.
Take the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine.
The vaccine is given to children to prevent measles and mumps.
There are two doses of this vaccine.
Statistics show that only 40 percent of children who take the first dose are not protected from these three viruses.
But only 4 percent of children who take both doses are at risk.
This also shows that no vaccine is 100% effective.
After taking the second dose, you are safer than people who have not been vaccinated or who have taken only one dose.
Therefore, it is important to complete the vaccine dose.
Which vaccines are given in India?
Both the Oxford-AstraZeneca covshield vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and the all-India covacin vaccine manufactured by Bharat Biotech have been approved by the Comptroller General of Drugs of India.
Will the first dose of one vaccine and the second dose of the second vaccine work?
This is a question for many. For example, will it work if I take the first dose of Covishield and the second dose of Covacin?
So it cannot be done in India.
It is mandatory to take both doses of the same vaccine.
But research is underway in the UK to study the effects of two doses of two different vaccines on the effectiveness and protection of an individual.
But at the moment, I have been told to take both doses of the same vaccine.
How long is the protection after vaccination?
Covid's vaccines were completed a few months ago, so this question cannot be answered right now.
Research is ongoing.
Current information suggests that antibodies in the body of a person infected with covid protects them from re-infection for some time, but no concrete information is available on how long this will last.
Are covid vaccines effective?
No vaccine is 100 percent effective, and covid vaccines are no exception.
As a result, some people may not develop immunity to the vaccine.
But covid vaccines are said to be very effective.
The vaccine is claimed to be 81 percent effective.
So what is the need to get vaccinated?
The Government of India has not made vaccination mandatory.
It is up to you to decide whether or not to get vaccinated.
Vaccines approved for vaccination are said to reduce the risk of infection.
It also makes you less likely to infect others.
Read this again on the go and remember that even after taking the first dose of the vaccine, all precautions need to be taken.
Do not assume that you are completely safe from infection even after taking the second dose.
Corona vaccine: Halfkin year-round vaccine production effort - Dr. Sandeep Rathore
Corona's havoc in Maharashtra is increasing day by day.
Experts believe that vaccination is an important measure to control the rapid spread of coronavirus across the country.
Following the demand of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, the Center has given permission to the Halfkin Institute to manufacture Covacin vaccine on a transfer basis from Bharat Biotech.
Secretary, Department of Science and Technology, Central Government, Dr. Renu Swaroop has written a letter to Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte informing about this.
How will covacin be produced in Halfkin Biopharma? How long is it likely to take? The BBC quoted Huffkin Biopharma's managing director, Dr. Discussed with Sandeep Rathore.
It is estimated that it will take at least a year for the vaccine to be developed.
But, with all the necessary permissions, we are trying to produce the vaccine within a year by signing a memorandum of understanding with Bharat Biotech as soon as possible.
We have received permission from the Department of Biotechnology under the Covid Security Scheme of the Central Government.
Q. How many vaccines will be made per year in Halfkin?
We have the capacity to produce 22.8 million doses a year once vaccine production begins in Halfkin.
The vaccine will be manufactured at Halfkin Biotech's Parel headquarters.
It is yet to be decided how many doses the state will get and how much will be given to other states once vaccine production starts.
This is an ambitious project.
There will be an internal team for this.
A technical team will be formed.
Vaccine production has two stages.
The raw material for vaccination and filling in the bottle after vaccination.
Security is very important for this.
Safety requires a three-level lab.
The raw material for the vaccine will be prepared in a ready BSL-3 lab. 
It will take six to eight months to build.
 This lab has to be built using very high quality technology.
 For this, we will take the help of scientists and technology experts.
Is safety important to keep the quality of the vaccine good?
Once the vaccine is prepared, it will be validated. 
The safety of the vaccine is paramount.
Special attention will be paid to safety at various stages to maintain the quality of the vaccine. 
This will be checked by experts from time to time.
Will Halfkin's vaccine be affordable?
As Halfkin Biopharma is a public sector unit, our vaccines are available at affordable prices. 
This vaccine will not be expensive.
This will be of great benefit to the state once the vaccine is manufactured.
Corona Maharashtra: Government announces help to tribals, but what happened to last year's financial aid?
On 13 April 2021, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, while addressing the people, again announced the lockdown.
While the lockdown was taking place, the government announced a Rs 5,400 crore aid package for the needy.
Rs 1500 will be provided to rickshaw pullers, registered peddlers and laborers.
Wheat and rice will be provided free of cost under the Food Security Act.
Besides, Rs. 2000 will be provided to 12 lakh tribals under Khawati scheme.
Opposition groups called for the beleagured PM to resign.
It was decided to give Rs. 4000 to the tribals under Khawati scheme.
But there are many complaints that last year's help has not yet been received.
This report presents the government's announcements, announced plans and the current situation.
'I heard that I will get help, but ...'
There are 7-8 people living in the house.
We are husband and wife, our old mother and five children ... We used to get up in the morning and work in the fields.
I had to go to sleep, said Chander Balu from Saparunga village in Wada taluka.
The grasses of the Katkari community are agricultural laborers.
I don't get a month's salary like the people in the city.
I used to postpone my daily routine.
I drank water for several days in a month in the back lockdown.
There was no food particle in the house.
Wheat and rice are available on ration.
But where will you get other spices to cook it?
Last time, it was heard that the government would pay Rs 4,000.
But nothing was found.
Now back to work.
The government has said it will help.
We don't get any help.
How many days do you want to starve? "
The situation of Surekha Pawar from the same village is worse than that of the grass family.
Surekha has a six-month-old son.
Before giving birth, Surekha and her husband used to work in the fields.
But now that there is no work, his family is struggling to make ends meet.
Says Surekha, "Sometimes I go to catch fish except for Pora.
If I get it, I sell it and get paid for that day.
If my mother-in-law gets a job in the laundry one day,
she gets Rs 100-150.
We do not have a ration card.
So there is no grain.
Last time, when the government closed everything, the ration card was removed.
But it was not sealed.
There is no money to go to the taluka for that.
The villagers were saying that they would get Rs 4,000 at the last closing time.
But some four thousand have not been seen to date.
We hear everything.
Nothing falls into place. "
What is Khawti Yojana?
The loan scheme was launched by the state government in 1978 for the economically disadvantaged tribals.
The scheme provided assistance to the tribals from the state government.
However, in 2013-14, the scheme was closed.
During the Corona period last year, the employment of tribals engaged in agricultural labor ceased.
The decision to provide financial assistance to them was taken by the state government at a cabinet meeting.
A ruling in this regard was issued on 9 September 2020.
As per the decision, the government agreed to provide Rs 2,000 in cash and Rs 2,000 worth of groceries like Matki, Chawli, Gram, Pea, Uraddal, Turdal, Sugar, Peanut Oil, Salt, Tea, Spices to the tribals under the Khawati scheme.
'Give back first, then speak now'
In the last lockdown, many organizations started agitation demanding help for tribal and Katkari families.
The support went to the labor union in the High Court.
Vivek Pandit, president of the Samarth Shramjivi Sanghatana and a tribal leader, said, "The government had agreed in the High Court on May 15, 2020 to provide foodgrains and other materials.
He decided to give Rs 2,000 in cash and Rs 2,000 in materials.
The ruling was issued in September.
But it was not until December that all this process was completed.
Many families were migrating then.
So how to deliver the material?
But since then, the government has taken no action.
So give it a go before you make a new announcement and then make a new announcement. "
Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis also told the media that the government's package was "dust-throwing".
He said, "The grant of Rs 2,000 announced in the Khawati scheme is going to wipe the mouths of the tribals.
Last year, the finance secretary had asked for it.
But the ministers did not give it as they wanted to buy materials.
Last year's Rs 4,000 grant has not been received yet."
Last year's Rs 482 crore will be distributed in two days
We sought the government's response to the opposition's allegations.
Why haven't the previous year's money been paid yet?
Will the same money be distributed or will tribals be paid as per the new package?
In this regard, we asked the state's Tribal Development Minister K. C. Asked Padvi.
He told BBC Marathi, "For a long time last year, a survey was conducted of the tribals living under this scheme.
There were some technical issues.
We have held review meetings in this regard in the last two days.
Now the technical issues have almost been resolved.
Therefore, in the next two-three days, 7 lakh tribal families will be given a cash grant of Rs.
The government will disburse the grant of Rs 482 crore.
The Rs 2,000 announced by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.
There is also provision for that money.
They will be categorized according to need. "
Corona: How do you explain to children about infections, immunity, vaccines?
Does your hand hurt when you get vaccinated?
Yeah ... a little ...
Then why do you get vaccinated? I don't like ... pierced ...
This question of a six-year-old boy, everyone is asking.
Children in your home may have similar questions, so I try to answer them in simple terms.
What is an infection?
There are two types of cells in the blood.
Red cells and white cells.
These white blood cells are the protective forces of our body.
A very clever organization that has assimilated all the guerrilla warfare like Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's Mavals!
Some of these cells are trapped in all parts of the body and are called "antigen presenting cells" (cells that stimulate the blood to produce antibodies).
The whole body is surrounded by skin.
If a germ (bacteria / virus / any other) accidentally penetrates through this wall, it cannot escape the gaze of these mammals.
Their first purpose is to catch him.
The cells capture and kill the germs and carry them directly to the commander.
These "lymph nodes" are called lymph nodes because there are different camps for these soldiers coming from each area.
(Fever, sore throat, lumps in the throat are the same!) Here the soldiers who bring germs meet the commander called "T cell".
They investigate the brought prisoner.
Is it dangerous?
What kind of power does he have?
What weapons?
This is how it is thoroughly scrutinized.
And all this information is given to the army.
In the army of "T cell" there is a special soldier called "B cell" who has the skill to make various weapons "customized" to suit every enemy.
Using this power, this weapon is the five types of "antibodies" (IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE and IgD) (the same ones that are tested in the lab!).
These five types of weapons have very specific functions.
If the enemy in front has a sword in his hand, then you have to have a shield in your hand, the tigers are useless there !!
The B cell is the weapon that makes up the bulk.
Another important task is to keep the enemy in good memory.
It's like taking a photo of the enemy and putting up a poster of "Wanted" all over the village to keep all the soldiers alert!
The next time the same enemy comes again, he does not panic!
These 'T cells' and 'B cells' combine to fight the forces at the very front, the "phagocyte" (a type of white blood cell that destroys microorganisms that enter the body) and literally devour the germ.
Such an encounter with any type of germ is called an infection.
What is immunity?
All of the above processes are constantly going on in our body because we are constantly exposed to one or another germ.
This power is innately inherited from our parents.
But she is born naive.
As we get older and more and more germs are exposed, these cells are formed.
And this fighting force keeps getting bigger and stronger.
This army, formed from birth in the mother's body, lends some weapons to the newborn baby.
In the process of a little birth and a little milk.
Breast milk contains natural immune-boosting ingredients.
When this army is ready, if an enemy enters through the coast, antibodies capture it and eat the phagocytes.
And even if there is an infection, there are no symptoms, or you are not bothered.
What is a vaccine?
Simply put, a vaccine is a dead germ! The dead / disarmed / depleted germ is injected into the body and realizing that the enemy has indeed arrived, our protective army is ready, armed with all the above processes.
That is, when a real enemy comes, he is killed before he can injure the body.
We have the gift of a brilliant scientist named Edward Jenner.
Vaccines are of many types, killed (killed germs), inactivated (deactivated germs), live attenuated (living germs that have been removed), subunit (only germ remnants).
How does the vaccine work ?
The same process as described above takes place in the body after vaccination.
All of these do not have a magic wand, so it takes four to six weeks for antibodies to form after a single dose.
After taking the next dose, it takes another three to four months.
The germs never come alone, they also have an army, the distance between two doses and the time after the last dose is very important to produce enough antibodies to fight that whole army.
This is called 'Siro Conversion'.
Sometimes, after many years of taking the dose, both the capacity and the level of antibodies produced are reduced, so vaccines like tetanus and typhoid need to be taken more frequently.
Just as our army is clever, sometimes the germs are twice as smart, changing their form, changing their weapons and tactics.
New mutations are needed every year for such mutations.
The flu virus is this type of germ.
Fever and body aches occur after taking the dose as the vaccine is also a type of infection.
It is a kind of acknowledgment that the body's fighting cells are ready to fight back.
Immunity is a natural strength given to everyone.
It cannot grow or strengthen overnight by taking any extract, turmeric-milk medicine or powder.
Proper square diet, adequate exercise, proper incorporation of micronutrients i.e. vitamins and minerals and positive attitude have benefits if included in the lifestyle for a long period of time (two days, not four weeks).
No matter how powerful this body structure is, it has limitations.
Avoiding exposure is the best way to treat epidemics.
Following the current corona outbreak, frequent hand washing with soap and sanitizer (corona virus is 'enveloped').
In soap and sanitizer, the shell dissolves and the germs die, not alone but there are many viruses), masks (on the nose).
Vaccine Preventable Diseases is a sure cure for diseases that can be controlled by taking a dose, so do not miss this dose.
In the end, it is true that "the living son of man is dependent".
We have a big hand in keeping our children healthy in the future.
To date, this world-changing technology has overcome incurable and chronic diseases, such as polio, measles, mumps, measles, mumps, rubella, and so on.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.
But the vaccine is a ray of hope.
These "armor coils" created by the brilliant scientists of the last century will surely be a gift to the next generation as well!
Pankaja Munde-Dhananjay Munde tweet over corona vaccine
In Maharashtra, on the one hand, the prevalence of corona vaccine is increasing rapidly, on the other hand, the shortage of corona vaccine is also increasing rapidly and political allegations against these issues are also increasing.
The latest allegations by the Munde brothers and sisters in Beed have now sparked controversy.
It started with BJP MP from Beed Dr. Performed by Pritam Munde.
Dr. In a tweet, Munde addressed Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and the Health Minister, saying, "Out of the 2 lakh vaccines received from the Center for the state, only 20 vaccines were distributed to Beed.
This is reprehensible.
We must rectify this imbalance."
From the same tweet, Dr. Pritam Munde also targeted Dhananjay Munde without naming him.
Dr. After this tweet of Pritam Munde, Dhananjay Munde has done a few tweets one after another.
In his very first tweet, Dhananjay Munde said, "After months of rest, I woke up suddenly and didn't know much about the outside world.
The 2 lakh vaccines given to the state by the Center are for the second dose of covacin.
Will not be. "
In particular, Dr. Dhananjay Munde. This tweet has also been tagged on Pratim Munde's Twitter handle.
Therefore, Dhananjay Munde directly asked Dr. It is clear that these answers were given to Pratim Munde.
Dr. Dhananjay Munde replied to a total of 6 tweets. Given to Pritam Munde.
In one of the tweets, Dhananjay Munde said, "Instead of writing a letter to Tai Saheb, Hon'ble Chief Minister and Hon'ble Health Minister, send a letter to Hon'ble Prime Minister with full information and insist on increasing the supply of vaccines so that we can really help in this fight against Corona!"
Furthermore, in a recent tweet, Dhananjay Munde tweeted a photo of the vaccine statistics table, saying, "We are giving you detailed statistics of the remaining 2 lakh vaccines received and required with the distribution of the newly acquired vaccine vaccine!
Jalna-Solapur is zero in the list of 20 vaccines you have shared.
Shouldn't we have the simple question of getting a vaccine in our own district? "
Tweetwar' is only for Beed MP Dr. It is not limited to Pritam Munde and Dhananjay Munde, the Guardian Minister of Beed.
Because BJP leader and former Women and Child Development Minister Pankaja Munde has also jumped into the controversy.
Pankaja Munde's sister Dr. Pritam rushed to Munde's aid.
He tweeted a screenshot of Dhananjay Munde's tweet saying, "For the good of the state, I will write this letter to the PM, the CM of the district and Pawar Saheb!
Do the old fund work, inaugurate it, you have the right, brother! "
Overall, there has been a good 'tweet war' among the Munde brothers and sisters over the supply of corona vaccine in Beed.
Why was Uddhav Thackeray humiliated to lockdown again in Maharashtra?
All viruses mutate, altering their own structure.
This process is done by them to survive in adverse conditions as well as to increase fertility.
The survival of the corona virus is forcing him to change himself.
But this struggle to change oneself is not seen in any government in India or in the people.
Otherwise, it would not have been a disgrace to impose lockdown for the second time in a year in Maharashtra.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has imposed a 15-day lockdown in the state from 8 pm on April 14 due to rising corona infection in Maharashtra.
Even while announcing this, Uddhav Thackeray did not call it a lockdown.
But it's a little more than a curfew and a little less than a lockdown.
In March last year, a nationwide lockdown was announced just hours before the announcement.
This was opposed by many political parties at that time.
The Maharashtra government was also involved.
He was backed by the central government and several doctors in the country, saying the lockdown was justified.
This, he argued, would break the chain of infection and give enough time to equip health facilities.
But a year later, the state chief minister is once again announcing a lockdown for 'Break the Chain'.
So the question arises as to why this time has come.
The question is whether we have not learned anything in one year.
Even after last year’s lockdown, there was no preparation to address the drug shortage.
What happened to the hospitals that were built during this period, ventilators were purchased, ICU beds were increased in one year?
To take stock of how much the situation has changed in the state in the last one year, the BBC has asked the Indian Medical Association's Maharashtra division's 2020 president, Dr. Interacted with Avinash Bhondwe.
According to him, whatever the government did last year.
It seems that the government has forgotten to learn from it or the people have forgotten it.
The remaining debris was filled by further disruptive planning.
He says, "People are disconnected from wearing masks, washing their hands and observing social distance.
Fever is ignored.
As a result, people are admitted to the hospital late.
Dr. Bhondwe raised a number of issues one after the other.
He said that it is necessary to learn a lesson from the following topics.
The points made by Bhondwe are as follows -
Lesson 1: Provision of Funds in Health Sector
Expenditure on health facilities in Maharashtra is only 0.5 per cent per annum.
It increased after the Covid-19 outbreak.
However, its share in the state government's budget did not reach 1 per cent, says Bhondwe.
An increase of Rs 500 crore has been mentioned in this year's budget.
But considering the epidemic, the figure is very low.
The IMA estimates that the health sector should account for at least 5 per cent of the total state budget.
Bhondwe also said that no new government hospital has been started in the state in a year during the outbreak.
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Ajit Pawar, while presenting this year's budget , has allocated Rs 7,500 crore for healthcare.
Lesson 2: There is still a shortage of hospitals, doctors, nurses and technicians
Dr. Bhondwe says, "Government hospitals in Maharashtra have only 10,000 beds.
As a result, most people are waiting for private hospitals.
During the Kovid-19 outbreak, 80 per cent of the burden is borne by private hospitals, while 20 per cent is borne by government hospitals."
The number of government hospitals equipped with all facilities is very low.
The number of hospitals with bypass surgery, cardiology, good operating theaters and ICU facilities is not even measurable.
But the current government is not the only one responsible for this, he explained.
These things have not been taken care of in the state for years.
There are no good government medical colleges or nursing colleges in the state.
The same is true of technicians working in the laboratory, says Bhondwe.
The number of registered doctors in the state is 1 lakh 25 thousand.
But there is a double need for doctors.
Last year, there was a shortage of nurses in the state.
The situation is still the same in Maharashtra.
The state has a 40 per cent shortage of nurses more than required.
This means that government hospitals cannot get even three nurses a day for each shift.
According to the new state law, such a quantity is required.
The situation is further exacerbated by the shortage of lab technicians working in the dialysis center, ICU, ventilator.
All these shortcomings cannot be filled in one year.
The government could not rectify the situation.
Even today, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is appealing to young doctors and nurses to join him.
Lesson 3: Planning a Trial
Even after a year has passed since Corona came along, people still have to wait a few days for the test results to come out, such complaints are being found on a large scale on social media.
It is now common for tests to take 2-3 days to arrive.
Last year, there were only 60 government and private testing centers in Maharashtra.
Also the number of laboratories was limited.
After one year, the number of test centers increased to 523.
But the number of laboratories did not increase as much as it should have.
The state has been seeing more than 57,000 patients daily since last week.
Although the number of tests per million has increased, it is not enough considering the number of patients per day.
The health secretary of the central government also agreed.
The proportion of RTPCR tests in the total tests is extremely low.
This test is considered extremely important for the corona.
There is no denying that corona proliferation is currently gaining momentum.
In many places whole families are seen to be positive.
In such cases, contact tracing has to be done more.
Tests are also becoming more frequent.
As a result, the load on the testing system is increasing.
Lesson 4: The Most Needed for Oxygen and Medicine
On Tuesday, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said, "There may be a shortage of oxygen in the state in the next few days.
But there may be delays in bringing oxygen from other states by road.
Delays in bringing oxygen from states more than 1,000 km away can be dangerous."
The Air Force should help us in this work.
According to experts, everyone knew that there would be another wave of corona infection.
The Director of Medical Research at Jaslok Hospital, Mumbai, Dr. Rajesh Parekh has written two books on corona, 'The Corona Virus Book' and 'The Vaccine Book'.
He says, "I wrote in my first book about the second and third corona waves.
We need to be prepared for that.
If the first wave sees 30,000 new patients every day in the state, 10 per cent of them would need to be hospitalized.
The state government should have statistics on the need for ICUs, oxygen and ventilators.
The same applies to remedivir.
In the coming wave, the state government had to prepare for 60,000 patients per day.
But we didn't think about it.
In other words, if the planning had been done twice a month after the first wave, the announcement made by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Facebook Live on April 13 would not have been needed.
It was clear from this that the disgrace of lockdown would not have been inflicted on Maharashtra.
Lesson 5: Accelerated Vaccination
Another thing related to future planning is vaccination.
We are producing vaccines for the whole world.
But we are constantly ignoring the situation in our home.
According to experts, a lockdown should be imposed to control the second wave, otherwise the vaccination campaign should be carried out expeditiously.
So far 1 crore citizens have been vaccinated in the state.
Dr. Rajesh says, "The polio and small pox vaccines were delivered door-to-door in India.
Some more measures need to be taken to expedite vaccination in the state.
Otherwise, these restrictions may need to be increased again and again.
Neither the state government nor the Indian government has learned from other countries."
Lesson 6: Migration of Foreign Workers
Dr. Rajesh says, "Last year saw a huge migration of foreign workers.
But the government has not learned anything from it.
Now it is seeing the same pattern for the second time.
A similar picture is emerging from many places in the state.
The state government cannot plan it properly. This shows.
The situation does not improve with the announcement on TV the day before.
Last year, the government had given only four hours.
At this time, the state government gave a period of 24 hours.
In such a short period of time, the situation may get worse.
There is a question of employment for the people who have returned to their respective villages.
The government had to guarantee their employment.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has planned to spend Rs 5,476 crore separately for the economically weaker sections as well as for the health sector.
But people should not be fired, rent should not be demanded, so some planning was needed, said Dr. Parekh thinks.
Chapter 7: Jumbo Covid Center closed
In the first wave of corona infection, several temporary jumbo covid centers of 1 to 2 thousand beds were started in India.
In many places the state government gave it to other institutions to run.
However, since September last year, the number of patients has been declining, with 100 or fewer patients being admitted per day.
So this Covid Center was closed.
The contract of the contracted doctor was also canceled.
This was a big mistake of the state government, said Dr. Bhondwe thinks so.
Now the state government will have difficulty in getting doctors again.
He also gave the example of a jumbo covid center in Pune.
The Municipal Corporation stopped paying the electricity bill due to urgency.
But now it's time to start again.
It is clear that the situation would not have been so bad if the government and the people had not forgotten the lessons learned from last year's wave.
Government of Maharashtra
The state government and the central government have often come face to face in handling the cowardly situation.
While the Center has lashed out at the state for a number of issues, including supply of vaccines and shortage of medicines, the state government has blamed the Center for not helping.
Now, when it comes to handling covid, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has claimed that the facilities have been increased in the last one year.
In his inaugural address, he said, "The number of coveted care centers in the state has increased by 1,500 from 2,600 last year.
Last year, there were 3,25,000 lakh beds, but now the number has gone up to 3,50,000."
On the same day, at the Central Government's regular press conference on April 12, Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan blamed the Maharashtra government for the waste of work.
He said, "The average number of patients in Maharashtra in 24 hours is increasing every week.
Now it has gone up to 57,000.
Infection is on the rise, but the rate of RTPCR tests in the state is low. "
In short, the central and state governments are facing each other here.
Even so, the state's health system is really capable of handling Corona's condition and the work she has done so far has been discussed by BBC Marathi with the head of the covid department at Fortis Hospital in Mumbai. Learned from Farah Ingle.
Maharashtra has been hit the hardest by the second wave.
We have to fight on two fronts.
To save the lives of those affected by the corona and to vaccinate people to protect them from the corona.
We have managed the two fronts competently.
Doctors, health workers, the administration, the government and the people of the state are working together to tackle the crisis.
The number of patients recovering every day proves that we are succeeding.
Maharashtra Corona: Read this before going out in the lockdown
Strict restrictions have been imposed in the state for the next fortnight.
However, during this time you will have many doubts about which services will be on and which will be closed.
Here are the answers to 7 such selected questions.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had said that some strict restrictions have to be imposed across the state for the next fortnight.
The decision to implement Section 144 across the state has been announced.
The Chief Minister has avoided calling it a lockdown.
He described the "Break the Chain" campaign as "strict restrictions" again.
Article 144, What exactly is a curfew?
What work can we go out for?
You have many such questions in your mind.
Here we will try to answer 7 such important questions.
First of all, these strict restrictions apply from time to time, from 8pm on Wednesday 14th April to 7am on 1st May.
Section 144 will be applicable during this period.
In other words, it can be said that there is a curfew and a curfew in the state.
Section 144 of the Indian Penal Code was enacted in 1973 and may be enforced by the administrative head of a state or a particular province.
According to this section, 4 or more people cannot come together or communicate together during this period.
Violators can face criminal charges.
Essential service movements are excluded.
This clause is used in case of erv communal riots or social outbreaks.
But, now this clause is being used for the second time during a health emergency.
The state government has published a detailed plan of which services and offices can be maintained in the time of these restrictions.
Detailed news based on it is also available on BBC Marathi website.
But even after that, you still have many doubts about it.
And that's what you ask on social media pages.
Let's see the answers to the selected questions now.
1. Can I go out to the grocery store to buy vegetables?
The answer to this is actually given by the Chief Minister himself in his speech.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray says, "All the shops providing essential services and food as well as food items will remain open during the period of restrictions."
Shops for food and raw materials are open during this period.
So you can go out and do the market as you need.
Meat and mutton shops will also continue.
However, if you are in a containment zone or if your building is sealed due to more than five corona patients as per the previous rules, the municipal administration will facilitate the delivery of these items to your area.
But, you also have to be careful.
Store a few days of groceries and vegetables at the same time without going out every day.
Don’t forget the mask when you go out.
And avoid eating vegetables during rush hour.
You can also order vegetables and groceries online these days and don't forget that it is allowed.
Can a housemaid helper come home?
This is the current million dollar question.
Unfortunately, the answer is yes only under certain circumstances.
That is, you will guarantee that the person will be brought to your home safely, that is, you will provide 'corona-free' transportation of the person, if your society allows you to do so, and only then you can invite anyone to do the housework.
But the government is also adamant that houseworkers are not getting some essential services.
Can I go out for take away / parcel?
The answer is yes.
Parcel service is allowed to continue from the food vendor on the street to the hotel so as not to inconvenience anyone's meal.
Bakery or tea stalls will also continue.
But, you can't stop there and eat this food.
You have to bring the parcel home.
If there is a valid reason, you can opt out. What is the valid reason?
If you have health problems at home, need help with it, or if you do, that's a valid reason.
All industries related to essential services are in operation, or the rainy season has not stopped.
It is valid if you are going out for such work.
If your company facilitates your transportation, such companies can also work.
If you go out of the house then it will work.
Such people can also work if you are accommodated in the workplace.
Director General of Police Sanjay Pandey has said that the police will not harass you if you go out for urgent work.
Pandey said, "Police will not harass those who go out for urgent work.
However, if they go out without any reason and violate the rules, the police will take action."
Passes are not required for essential traffic.
No more than five people should leave after section 144 comes into force.
Lockdown is for the public, Pandey added.
He further added that if anyone violates the rules, they should not use sticks.
Rely on public transport only?
No. Rickshaws and taxis will also continue during this period.
But there are some rules to follow when traveling.
Fifty percent of the capacity of public buses is seating and standing is not allowed.
The taxi can accommodate two more people besides the driver.
The rickshaw can also accommodate two people including the driver.
You only want to get out if you need to.
Is it possible to move from one district to another district or state?
Yes. If you are traveling for work and you follow the rules of corona, negative covid report and mask, social distance, then there are no restrictions on such travel at present.
Many of you have asked if your train ticket has been issued, then you can go.
But, if there is such a solid reason for it, then we should come out.
Will industry, construction, offices continue?
The answer depends on what industry you work in.
All industries such as food, essential services, health are allowed.
But, there are some restrictions for the construction and manufacturing sector.
You need to prove that your company cares about the health of its employees. T
his means that either the employees have to live in the same colony, from where the company has to make arrangements to bring them directly to the company.
Otherwise the company or office may continue to operate in a place where the company has made complete arrangements for the transportation of employees.
In the construction sector too, if the construction site is fully staffed, it can be continued.
But, for that, employees or laborers will not be able to go out freely.
Even so, owning one is still beyond the reach of the average person.
Some have asked if the liquor store will continue.
No, that's the answer.
How did China's economy grow after the outbreak of the corona virus?
China's GDP has risen sharply in the wake of the Corona outbreak.
In the first quarter of 2021, China's economy grew by 18.3 percent year-on-year.
China has been recording quarterly records since 1992.
This is the highest increase in the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) since then.
According to Reuters, China's economy is expected to grow by 19 percent.
But in reality the growth was a little less than expected.
Last year, China was hit by a major financial crisis.
Compared to him, these numbers seem to be higher.
But the increase is said to be unexpected.
In the first quarter of 2020, a national lockdown was declared in China.
China's economy was hit hard during that period.
At the time, China's GDP had shrunk to 6.8 percent.
The situation in China last year was basically dire.
Therefore, according to the statistics released now, it seems that China has returned.
Industrial production rose 14.1 per cent year-on-year to March.
Retail sales also grew by 34.2 per cent.
China's economy is heavily dependent on exports.
Currently, factories are focusing on orders for overseas products, so the picture above is said to have emerged.
Also, domestic business is slowly growing.
Some experts believe that this will fill the void left by the corona.
Even before the Corona outbreak, the Chinese government was trying to boost the economy.
It was trying to increase the percentage of citizens spending on personal use.
But they succeeded to some extent.
After the Corona outbreak, the problems facing the government increased, he said.
In the last quarter of 2020, China's economic growth rate was 6.5 percent.
These figures also show that China has maintained the same pace.
China's economy slowly picked up speed after the Corona outbreak hit.
Proper planning was done to prevent the spread of the virus, as well as emergency assistance to the industry.
Despite the poor performance in the first quarter of 2020, China's economy continued to grow rapidly.
China was the only economy in the world to record economic growth in 2020.
China, the world's second-largest economy, grew by 2.3 percent in 2020.
This is the lowest number in the last several years.
After the crisis last year, China aims to maintain 6 percent economic growth in 2021.
Corona: Why did Denmark stop giving AstraZeneca vaccine?
Denmark has suspended a vaccine against the Oxford-AstraZeneca corona virus.
Denmark has become the first European country to do so.
The postponement was due to complaints of blood clots forming after receiving the vaccine.
But such complaints are rare, just as important.
Denmark's decision could have an impact on its vaccination campaign.
The European Medicines Agency, which monitors drugs in Europe, said last week that blood clots could be linked to the vaccine.
But the risk of death from Covid-19 is many times greater.
Some countries in Europe have already stopped using the AstraZeneca vaccine for some time.
AstraZeneca vaccination is being implemented in most European countries.
But there are some restrictions on the use of this vaccine in the elderly.
On Tuesday, the United States, Canada and the European Union banned the use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for similar reasons.
In South Africa, Johnson & Johnson's vaccine use was suspended for the same reason.
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was effective on the South African variant of the corona virus.
It is a popular vaccine in South Africa.
However, its use was postponed, it is special.
The AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines work the same way.
They are called adenoviral vectors.
Why did Denmark bring a moratorium?
Until further notice, we are withdrawing all 2.4 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, Danish officials said.
According to local health officials, one person in every 40,000 suffers from blood clots.
According to an AFP report, the vaccine was found in two cases of blood clots in Denmark.
It also killed a 60-year-old woman.
The company's director general, Soren Brostrom, commented.
The decision was difficult for the government.
But Denmark has other vaccine options available.
At present, the corona epidemic in the country is under control, he said.
He added, "The risk of covidosis in the country of those who will be vaccinated with corona has been reduced many times over."
Officials have not ruled out the possibility of the AstraZeneca vaccine being used again in the country.
About 1 million people in Denmark have been vaccinated so far.
One and a half million of them have been vaccinated against AstraZeneca.
Vaccines from Pfizer Bioentech and Modern are also being used in Denmark.
Emergency service vehicles to get 'color code' in Mumbai
In Mumbai, caller codes will be issued to vehicles providing essential services during lockdown.
Mumbai Police is trying to reduce the number of vehicles on the roads during the lockdown.
Red color for vehicles of medical staff, medical services
Green for vegetables, groceries, fruits and dairy carts
Yellow for essential service
These will be 6 inch round stickers affixed on these vehicles.
These stickers will be affixed on the front and rear windows of the vehicle.
The stickers will be obtained from the police at some toll plazas and blockades.
The order was issued by Mumbai Police Commissioner Hemant Nagarale himself.
Doctors, ambulances and medical vehicles are getting stuck due to checkpoints at toll plazas.
A color code policy is being introduced for this.
Emergency service people will have to affix stickers on the vehicles, said Hemant Nagarale.
Police, corporations, journalists, doctors, some are taking advantage by putting up posters like this.
Therefore, the Mumbai Police is investigating whether the employees in the vehicles are working for essential services.
We want to carry out the lockdown announced by the Maharashtra government well, said Hemant Nagarale.
On the other hand, Mumbai's Guardian Minister Aslam Sheikh said, "The vegetable market is not overcrowded.
If it is overcrowded, it will be closed in a day or two."
Corona virus statistics: How many corona patients are there in Mumbai, Pune, Maharashtra today?
In Maharashtra today (April 17) 67 thousand 123 new cases of corona were found, while 419 people died due to corona today.
The number of active patients infected with corona virus in Maharashtra has now reached 6,47,933.
Today (April 17) 8811 patients were found in Mumbai Municipal Corporation area, 1593 in Thane Municipal Corporation area, 6084 in Pune Municipal Corporation area and 5126 in Nagpur Municipal Corporation area.
In Maharashtra today (April 17) 56 thousand 783 patients recovered and returned home.
The recovery rate of the state is 81.18%.
Corona killed 419 people in Maharashtra on Friday.
To date, 59,970 people have died of corona in the state.
The health ministry, meanwhile, put the death toll at 419, up from 220 in the last 24 hours, 102 in the previous week and 97 in the previous week.
Corona drugs: How much is the sale of essential drugs on the black market?
Last Thursday, Akhilesh Mishra started getting fever.
They also had a little cough.
They thought it must be the flu.
But after his father - Yogendra Mishra started having the same problem, he started worrying.
Both of them decided to do RT-PCR test for Covid and consult a doctor.
Everywhere he was being given an appointment three days later.
They finally got a Sunday slot at a hospital.
Meanwhile, Yogendra Mishra's health started deteriorating.
Fever rate increased.
The doctor told him to be admitted to the hospital as soon as possible.
But that was the biggest challenge.
Many hospitals in Noida, including the capital Delhi, rejected him.
He was finally admitted to a private hospital in Delhi.
Akhilesh says his father's health has improved.
But for a moment, they were afraid that something bad would happen.
He says, "I was getting depressed.
I thought if something bad happened to them because I didn't get treatment ... the situation I went through shouldn't happen to anyone.
Everyone should get treatment."
But this is not their only story.
Many families in India are currently looking for hospital beds, life-saving medicines or oxygen cylinders.
In some cities in India, there are reports of declining mortuaries.
Reports of covid tests also have to wait for hours.
Many labs do not report before 48 to 72 hours.
A 35-year-old man I met outside a private lab in Noida told me, "I've been experiencing symptoms of covid for the last three days, so I'm worried.
But I'll have to wait 2-3 days for a report."
The black market of drugs
In the last few days, many posts have been appearing on social media in search of essential medicines.
Many have said that they do not have access to drugs such as remedicivir and toxilizumab.
The use of these two drugs for the treatment of Covid 19 is being discussed around the world, but some other countries, including India, have allowed the use of both drugs in case of emergency.
That is why there is a lot of demand for Remedesivir right now.
Despite India's ban on the export of these drugs, drug manufacturers in India cannot meet the demand.
In the last two days, more than two lakh new cases have been reported in India every day.
Earlier, one lakh to one and a half lakh patients were being registered every day for almost a week.
There are 7 companies producing Remedesivir in India.
Hetro Pharma is one of them.
The company says it is trying to increase production of the drug.
However, the BBC's investigation found that due to the shortage of the drug, remedesivir is being blackmailed in many other cities besides Delhi.
Speaking to the BBC, three marketing agents offered to give 100 grams of remedesivir for Rs 24,000.
This figure is five times higher than the official price of this drug.
Corona patients should be given 6 doses of this drug as per the instructions of the Union Ministry of Health of India.
Only then is the course of this medicine considered to be completed.
But many doctors say that some patients need to be given eight doses of remedivir, and for a middle-class family this amount can be large.
Atul Garg's mother had to be admitted to a private hospital in Delhi.
He says, "I had to spend a lot to get that medicine.
When I contacted hundreds of people, I got the medicine after walking for a few hours."
Tosilizumab, a drug used to treat arthritis, has also been approved for the treatment of covid 19.
But even this drug is almost missing from the Indian market.
Rajiv Singhal, general secretary of the All India Chemist and Druggist Association, says, "My phone rings all day long with calls for help to prescribe this drug.
But the situation is so bad that I can't even prescribe this drug for my family members.
We are trying to take action against the people.
But we have to admit that the system is leaking. "
Oxygen, X-ray and covid test
Demand for medical oxygen has increased in many states of India.
Many hospitals do not have space so they have to send patients back.
Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has demanded that the supply of oxygen to hospitals should be done by Air Force aircraft as it takes a long time to deliver oxygen to hospitals by road.
The situation in small towns is even worse.
Doctors are advising patients to arrange for oxygen cylinders at home if space is not available in the hospital.
Nabil Ahmed's father, who lives in a small village in northern India, contracted the corona.
Five days after realizing this, they started having trouble breathing.
The doctor advised them to bring an oxygen cylinder home.
They had to travel four hours to reach the city.
After an eight-hour journey, he was able to bring home an oxygen cylinder for his father.
Another big problem in small towns and villages is that private labs refuse to do X-rays and CT scans.
But doctors are using these options to check if the corona is infected.
Yogesh Kumar of Allahabad says that X-rays can be taken only after being admitted in a hospital.
You can also go to a government hospital, but there is a long waiting list.
A doctor in Allahabad told the BBC, "I can't even take X-rays of my patients.
For some patients, we rely entirely on blood test reports, but this is not correct."
Stress on cemeteries
Cheetahs burn day and night in cemeteries in many cities where the corona virus is highly contagious.
Families have to wait for hours to bury their loved ones.
A video of several cheetahs being set on fire at a cemetery in Lucknow at night had recently gone viral.
Cemetery staff work tirelessly.
Lalit Kant, an epidemiologist, says, "We did not learn from the first wave of corona infection.
We knew there would be a second wave of infection.
But we did not fill the shortage of medicines, hospitals and health care systems, oxygen. Not taken. "
Dharavi warriors who worked without a single day off during the Corona period
It's over! How to say that? If we don't go home, the number of patients will increase.
This is our job.
I didn't learn to be a doctor.
But the work done during Corona's time has been very satisfying.
People have a lot of respect.
I'm proud to be a health worker.
Go to any alley in Dharavi, Wadi in the morning ... Women with paper-pen in hand, face mask, bottle of sanitizer, oximeter and gun thermometer are seen going from house to house questioning people.
Ankita Shedge, Ulka Parab and Mirabai Kale ... you may not have heard these names.
However, Dharavikar is considered a family member.
These women have a backyard in Dharavi.
People's names are memorized.
But, who are these women?
Why are we talking about this?
You may have had such a question.
Covid warrior of Dharavi
Dharavi is known as the largest slum in Asia.
Dharavi became the hotspot of Covid-19 in the first wave of corona infection.
Everyone was afraid that the corona would spread rapidly in Dharavi.
But, these community health workers have stood and are standing as a shield in the fight against corona.
She is known as a health worker in Dharavi.
Without taking a year off, without fear of corona, these health workers are scrambling to save lives.
Every day, his work starts at 9 am.
One by one, the women cross the street and leave.
This has been going on for the last year and will continue until the end of the Corona, says Ankita Shedge.
The World Health Organization praised the Dharavi pattern for corona control.
The credit for this goes to the hard work of these health workers along with the administration.
'Proud to be a health worker'
Ulka Parab has been working as a health worker in Dharavi since 1990.
Thursday was his duty as usual.
Only by going from house to house, patients will be informed.
People will get treatment on time, their lives will be saved, she says.
Ulka Parab is responsible for the NL camp premises in Dharavi.
When we arrived, they were checking the house.
She tells of the experience of the first wave of the corona.
I saw the first case in Dharavi.
I was very scared.
There are children and husbands at home.
What about them?
This question was in my mind.
Why not be scared, I surveyed the area.
During the Corona period, not a single day of Ulka Parab took a holiday.
Afraid of Corona?
She says, "We've learned a lot over the last year.
It's not so scary now.
But, after going to the patients, you have to take proper care."
Dharavi Municipal Corporation has started a house-to-house search operation.
The big benefit of this is to find the suspect and the corona patient.
The support of the people is important to overcome the corona infection.
Did people support you over the last year?
She says, "When we left, people thought they had someone.
You came, don't worry, people say.
They feel confident after talking to us."
"I have been working as a community health worker for many years. "
But, I got real satisfaction from my work in Corona.
'Yes, the body is tired!'
While examining an 80-year-old grandmother, did you get tired of working all year? That's the question we asked.
The body is tired.
The soul is completely exhausted, it feels like work.
If you want to take a holiday for four or eight days and relax, Corona puts it on your head again.
The festival is over, Diwali is over.
Meteor's husband worked for a courier company.
"My mistress's job is gone.
They don't call me to work.
So we have to work," she says.
'Enough! How can you say that? '
Ankita Shedge is responsible for the Kumbharwada area of ​​Dharavi.
Ankita, who lived in Jogeshwari till last year, has now shifted to Dharavi.
It's over, I won't say that.
If we don't go home, the number of patients will increase.
We have to work.
While walking with Ankita, he suddenly started speaking in Gujarati.
How are you? How are you?
Ankita Shedge was questioning an old woman.
The area is inhabited by people who speak different languages.
So speaking in their own language, it is clear that people consider these health workers to be even more appealing.
These health workers do a great job of creating awareness among the elderly, children, men and women.
They are acting as a link between the administration and the general public.
She says, "I tell people, don't be afraid.
We want to get out of this.
We check them.
Some people call themselves.
They tell us the symptoms
Madam asks what to do.
Then, we send them to the quarantine center or hospital as needed."
In the second wave of corona infection, the number of patients in Dharavi is increasing again.
But, still many people are not seen walking around wearing masks, while some were seen wearing masks on their chins.
Ankita is somewhat annoyed with people's behavior.
"People don't listen.
They don't wear masks.
You said they wear masks.
They turn their backs and take them off again."
But, she says, people are more cooperative now than they were last year.
"Last year, people didn't come forward at all."
I tried to run away with PPE insects.
They didn't come out of the house.
'We have the world'
There are community health workers like Mira Kale, Ulka Parab and Ankita.
She says, I tell people, we're just like you.
We take care of ourselves.
You take care of the family, too."
People are growing sick because people don't listen.
People have a misconception that there is no corona.
Municipal Corporation providing medical services in Dharavi, Priyanka says, "In the first wave, people were afraid to go to the quarantine center.
But, now they know.
People are testing.
Quarantine is happening.
Covid is tired of working with other work.
But, we will keep working."
Will sadhus and saints respond to Narendra Modi's call for a symbolic celebration of Kumbh Mela?
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has appealed to the saints that the Kumbh Mela should be celebrated only in a symbolic manner in view of the outbreak of Corona.
The Prime Minister appealed to the saints by tweeting.
He wrote, "I had a phone conversation today with Acharya Mahamandleshwar Swami Awadheshanand Giri, the presiding deity of the old akhada.
Two royal baths have now taken place.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also thanked everyone for the support extended to the administration by the saints.
Swami Awadheshanand Giri responded to Prime Minister Modi's tweet on Twitter.
He said, "We respect the call of the Hon'ble Prime Minister.
Protecting lives is the highest task of Pune.
The number of devotees gathered at Kumbh Mela for the past one week has been hotly debated in the country.
Most people are seen criticizing Aquarius.
It is being warned that such a large number of people could be dangerous in one place during the Corona period.
Chief Medical Officer of Haridwar, Dr. S. K. According to Jha, 1664 covid positive patients were found in Kumbh Mela between April 10 and 14.
35 of them are monks.

Vivek: Did this Tamil actor get a heart attack due to corona vaccination? What is the doctor saying?
Tamil actor Vivek passed away in Chennai on Saturday.
He was 59 years old and had suffered a heart attack.
But his death is being discussed, as Vivek had gone to a government hospital a day before his heart attack and was vaccinated against covid.

Vivek was vaccinated on Thursday (April 15).
He then spoke to the media about his experience of vaccination and appealed to people to get vaccinated.
On Friday (April 16), Vivek suffered a massive heart attack and collapsed at home.
Vivek was rushed to SIMS Hospital in Chennai.
According to the hospital, Vivek was brought to the hospital by his family around 11 a.m. when he was unconscious.
The doctors started treating him immediately.
Vivek was then subjected to some tests and then angioplasty.
He was in the ICU when he died early Saturday (April 17).
Vivek was diagnosed with Acute Coronary Syndrome, a disease of the coronary arteries of the heart, which led to a heart attack and is not likely to have been caused by a vaccine, explained Dr. Given by Vijaykumar Chokhani.
Many fans in the country, including Tamil Nadu, have mourned Vivek's death.
Vivek was known as a comedian and had acted in more than 500 films.
He had also acted in Rajinikanth's 'Shivaji the Boss'.
They are included in the icons of creation in Tamil film.
He was also honored with the Padma Shri award.
Vivek was a fan of the late President APJ Abdul Kalam.
After his son died of dengue, he got involved in social work.
He had undertaken a tree planting campaign and planted more than three million trees.
He had planned to plant one crore trees.
Aquarius and Corona: 'Seeing the situation in Haridwar, I left everything to God'
Mumbai resident Ujjwal Puri, a 34-year-old entrepreneur and photographer, arrived in Haridwar on the morning of March 9.
At the time, they had masks, sanitizers and vitamin pills.
Before boarding the flight to Dehradun, he thought that Haridwar would have very tight security.
They also thought that they would have difficulty getting access.
Ujjwal tried to register his covid negative test report on the go vernment website.
But the website was not running.
They reached Haridwar, but were not checked anywhere at the airport or after exiting.
He took some photos in 'Har Ki Paudi'.
Most of the devotees there did not have masks on their faces.
Most of the people who had a mask on their face had the mask slung under their nose or even on their chin.
Ujjwal took a photo on a ghat at night.
There was also a crowd of unmasked people on the steps of the ghat.
Some women have joined hands in an emotional gesture.
Some are changing clothes.
Someone is drying your hair with a towel.
Someone is dumb looking at a mobile.
Someone has a baby in their arms, while someone is seen chatting with others.
He says, "There was no such thing as social distance.
People used to stand facing each other during the evening aarti."
Ujjwal stayed in Kumbh Mela for three days.
In the meantime, I had taken out a mask to take selfies with Baba people only once in three days.
Ujjwal says, "I left everything to God."
Bright returned home three days later.
But they were scared at the time.
He said, "The first thing I did when I returned was to test the corona.
As soon as I entered the house, I locked myself in a room.
I have my parents in the house.
So I had to be careful."
According to government figures, corona has killed 1.33 lakh people in India so far.
Many states are in dire need of hospital beds, oxygen and medicines.
People are seen rushing to get a place in the hospital.
The cemetery also has queues for funerals.
In such a situation, the crowd of lakhs at Kumbh Mela is being referred to as a superspreader event.
Even during the Corona period, the Kumbh Mela held in BJP-ruled Uttarakhand is said to be the politics of Hindutva of the ruling party.
Gopal Bharadwaj, a historian living in Mussoorie, thinks that Kumbh Mela should have been avoided during the Corona period.
He said, "Do people who do not go for bathing in Aquarius become partners in sin?
This is for peace of mind.
If someone falls ill at home, what peace will there be?"
Gopal Bharadwaj says, "In the past, Kumbh Mela was held for only two weeks.
But in the last 35-40 years, due to marketing, its duration has increased."
He says, "The main bath in Kumbh Mela is Baisakhi.
But then Makar-Sankranti was associated with it.
Mahashivaratra also came in.
Shivratra is a different and important festival.
According to Gopal, Aquarius means religious conduct.
In the past it had a classical meaning.
It discussed how to save our religion.
Large arenas have been built for the protection of Hinduism.
In this, if there is a bad tendency in Hinduism, there is a discussion on how to keep it away.
But it was slowly diminishing.
Who has so much time now?
Are there so many scholars?
At the moment, the emphasis is on marketing everything. "
An atmosphere of fear among the people
According to Mithilesh Sinha, who runs a Dharamshala in Haridwar during the Kumbh Mela during the Corona period, there is an atmosphere of fear among the locals at present.
He says, "The devotees who come here leave in a day or two.
But it is not possible to say what prasad they will give to the locals.
It is very difficult to explain to the people when it comes time to discuss devotion."
The Corona virus does not know the difference between a believer and an atheist.
It is not clear how many covid positive patients were found in the Kumbh Mela from the beginning.
But an official said that about two hundred patients are found every day.
According to Kumbh Mela Covid Nodal Officer Dr. Avinash Khanna, there are 50 corona test centers here.
During Kumbh Mela, RTPCR test is being done for those who come to stay in Dharamshala and antigen test is being done for those who are returning, Khanna gave.
But the biggest concern is how much the virus will spread from covid positives returning home.
Petition in court
This fear has been mentioned by local resident Sachchidanand Dabral in his public interest litigation filed in the Nainital High Court.
He had filed the petition last year.
He had asked in the petition how the district administration could work to bring Kovid Saath under control when millions of people would come to Kumbh Mela.
Sachchidanand owns a pharma company.
He also runs a drug store.
According to him, the situation in Corona in Haridwar was under control in November-December.
Trivendra Singh Rawat was the Chief Minister at that time.
At that time, he had said that the negative RTPCR test report of the citizens coming to Kumbh Mela was mandatory.
But the new Chief Minister Tirath Singh Rawat, who was sworn in as the Chief Minister on March 10, did not impose any restrictions on the citizens attending the Kumbh Mela.
On the day of Mahashivaratri on March 11, 36 to 37 lakh people arrived at Haridwar Ghat.
Since then, the situation in Haridwar has started deteriorating, said Sachchidanand.
The court has said that 50,000 tests should be done here every day.
But the number of tests here has never gone beyond 9,000 to 10,000, he said.
But the cowardly nodal officer of Kumbh Mela, Dr. Avinash Khanna denies the allegation.
According to the court order, more than 50,000 tests are being conducted every day, he said.
A committee formed by the court following Sachchidanand's petition had visited the ghats in March.
He then submitted his report to the court.
Sachchidanand's lawyer Shiv Bhatt, who is also a member of the committee, said, "The committee's inspection revealed that the condition of the ghats was very bad.
After inspecting the ghats, we went to a hospital in Rishikesh.
There is a covid center for the entire Garhwal.
There is no ultrasound facility.
The condition of toilets and wards is very bad.
There are no bed pans, no trash cans.
The elevator here is out of order. "
Officials were claiming that the two crore crowd was handled properly that day.
But on the day of the royal bath, the administration could not control even a crowd of three million, Bhatt said.
Appreciate the work of the administration
But 25-year-old Sandeep Shinde, who came from Mumbai to participate in the Kumbh Mela, praised the work of the police and administration in Haridwar.
Sandeep is a painter by profession.
They are staying in a large hall in an ashram in Haridwar.
Here 10 other devotees like him are lying on the ground with mattresses.
Sandeep came to Kumbh Mela alone.
He said that he had come to experience this festival which is held once in twelve years.
It was a great pleasure for me to come here, to experience the royal bath.
Sandeep himself uses a mask.
After returning to the ashram, they wash their hands, feet and mouth with hot water.
He said, "I haven't heard of Corona anywhere.
Nobody talks about Corona here."
But in many cases, Kumbh Mela is being called a 'super spreader event'.
A senior journalist from Dehradun thinks that after the end of Kumbh Mela, a very divisive picture will be created in Uttarakhand.
According to government figures, 1800 people have died due to corona in Uttarakhand so far.
Raghavendra Das of Panch Ramanandiya Khaki Akhada admitted that people are scared.
But he goes on to say, "People are not afraid of death when it comes to faith and religion.
Doesn't Corona spread from the election, why shouldn't she be considered a superspreader?
Does Corona only spread to religious places?
Governments that name Indian culture are opening liquor stores.
Punch Ramanandiya asked whether the corona does not spread from there.
Omkar Das, who was sitting next to him, said that the real reason behind people falling ill in Haridwar was the atmosphere here.
Haridwar is hot during the day and cold at night. Besides, not a single positive patient with 100 per cent corona has been found here, he said.
Corona: Corona is spreading rapidly among the youth due to 'these' reasons
I'm not going to have a corona, it's a misconception.
I'm a bodybuilder.
People think about how I'm going to have a corona.
No one can guarantee that I'm going to have a corona. .
The superintendent of KEM Hospital, Mumbai, Dr. Hemant Deshmukh's words are forever remembered by everyone.
The second wave of corona infection is spreading rapidly in Maharashtra.
Not big cities like Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur.
Rural areas have also been affected by the tsunami.
According to experts, mutated coronavirus is a highly contagious, highly contagious, and immunosuppressive virus.
So in the second wave, many families are being coronated.
What is the difference between the first and second wave of Covid-19 infection?
Why is corona infection so prevalent among young people?
In this regard, we have Dr. Learned from Hemant Deshmukh.
Q - What Coronas in the first wave and the second wave This uniqueness of this?
Dr. Hemant Deshmukh - In the first wave of corona infection, people between the ages of 15 and 40 did not show much infection.
Corona infections were more common in people with diabetes, high blood pressure, lung failure, or lung disease.
People with comorbidities and no other illnesses are more likely to be infected with corona.
Infection is less common in patients on dialysis.
But those who do not have any disease, those who are healthy, are more likely to have coronary heart disease.
Question - any disease between the ages of 15 and 30 who are not young men Corona getting more exposure?
Is the disease serious?
Dr. Hemant Deshmukh - A young man suffering from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) was admitted to hospital last year.
But this year, the incidence of corona among young people between the ages of 15 and 30 has increased.
Importantly, people come to the hospital eight to ten days after the symptoms appear.
It is important to recognize the first day of illness.
It is necessary to be admitted to the hospital before the fifth or sixth day after the illness.
But this time, it is felt that the educated youth stay at home for a long time.
This is because they do some blood tests.
Perform high resolution CT scan (HRCT) and RTPCT test at home.
It takes three days for a report to arrive in a private lab.
These three days are proving to be detrimental.
This class ignores treatment until the report is positive.
About 20 per cent of the patients admitted to KEM are young.
They have been diagnosed with a serious form of infection.
Importantly, educated youth see the CT (Cycle Threshold) value of the RTPCT test.the viral load in the body.
All those with a CT value greater than 35 will be negative.
The lower the CT value, the higher
Young people with an HRCT value of more than 5/25, on the other hand, are walking out without a hitch.
It is not possible to dispel misconceptions among these educated people.
Which is the most important.
Q - Can strong people get corona infection?
Dr. Hemant Deshmukh - People misunderstand that I will not be a corona.
People give examples, other places are crowded.
There is no corona.
No one has guaranteed that Corona won’t happen.
People should think that I can be a corona too.
No matter how healthy I am, I can get corona infection.
This is because the virus does not age.
The disease affects everyone from newborns to 100-year-olds.
The young class is behaving carelessly.
Going out for parties, weekends, going out even when there is no work is making the younger generation more infected.
Q - How dangerous is the second wave of corona infection?
Is the virus spreading through the air?
Dr. Hemant Deshmukh - This is not the second wave.
This has to be called a tsunami.
A tsunami is worse than a wave.
Compared to last year, Corona has taken on a more formidable form.
Corona virus is a cause for concern.
Importantly, the virus is spread through the air. I
n the first wave, the corona infection was thought to be caused by coughing or by contact with any surface.spreading through the air.
That is why it is very important to use a mask.
This mask should not be cloth.
Use a triple layer or surgical mask.
If you feel uncomfortable after using the mask, then the mask should be considered good.
In Japan, if two people come together, it is considered a crowd.
But you don't feel comfortable without meeting five people.
The two should understand the crowd.
Most importantly, eat alone while eating.
Do not speak with the mask down.
Q - Are the symptoms different in the first and second waves?
Dr. Hemant Deshmukh - The number of patients suffering from heart attack, brain stroke, blood clots in the legs or gangrene was high after the first wave of corona infection.
But in the second wave, red eyes, no taste in the mouth, no smell.
Symptoms include cold, cough, fever, fatigue and arthritis.
Q - Is the double mutation in the corona virus spreading the infection?
Dr. Hemant Deshmukh - There are changes in the virus.
The corona virus also took 400 days to mutate.
We mingled with the people.
As a result, the virus mutated.
You have started vaccination to fight this virus.
Heard immunity will be created if immunity is developed in people.
Question - were health workers are doing work around the clock throughout the year?
How is their mood?
Dr. Hemant Deshmukh - 400 days have passed since the beginning of Corona.
All the doctors are serving the coronaries.
But I am constantly tired from working.
Fatigue has definitely come after 400 days.
But, why all the doctors do it with one eye.
No matter how severe the tsunami, we will continue to strive for patients.
Q - What message will you give to the youth ?
Dr. Hemant Deshmukh - You are the backbone of the family.
So be careful.
You want to judge the next generation.
I want to take care of the previous generation.
So we need to be strong. Is.
The 35 years of strength you have can’t beat Corona.
You will be safe and your family will be safe if you follow the triad of mask, cleanliness and social distance.
Corona symptoms: Why is happy hypoxia fatal for corona sufferers?
Covid-19 has claimed millions of lives worldwide so far.
These numbers are increasing day by day.
The situation in Maharashtra is deteriorating.
If there is a condition called happy hypoxia with this disease, then the patient's distress is further aggravated.
Let's see what exactly this condition is and how it puts the patient at risk.
'Shortness of breath'
The corona virus infects the patient's lungs.
The corona virus spreads or multiplies in large numbers after infiltration into the lungs.
Which makes it difficult for patients to breathe.
In medical parlance this is called 'shortness of breath'.
In the critical stage there is no breathing, the oxygen level in the body drops drastically and the patient feels the need for oxygen or ventilator support.
If the patient is having difficulty breathing, the doctor may instantly inspect the corona.
Shortness of breath is one of the main symptoms of corona infection.
What is Happy Hypoxia?
Doctors in Mumbai and Maharashtra are seeing a rare symptom of Covid-19.
In which the amount of oxygen in the body of covid positive patients is very low, but the patients do not have difficulty in breathing.
Although the oxygen level in the body is low, the patient looks normal.
There are no symptoms of obstruction of breathing.
In medical parlance, doctors call this 'Happy Hypoxia'.
In Maharashtra, 7106 patients have died due to Covid-19 till June 26.
More than 4,000 corona victims have died in Mumbai.
Cases of 'Happy Hypoxia' have also been reported in the state.
The doctor suffered from happy hypoxia
The famous General Physician from Santacruz area of ​​Mumbai, Dr. Vasant Shenoy also suffered from 'Happy Hypoxia'.
He was admitted to the hospital due to low oxygen level in his body.
A few days ago, Dr. Shenoy overcame Kovid and returned home.
But, they still have to take half a liter of oxygen every minute.
How does Happy Hypoxia suffer?
Recognizable?
In this regard, we have Dr. Tried to know Shenoy's experience.
Speaking to the BBC, Dr. Vasant Shenoy says, "A normal person has 95 to 99 per cent oxygen in his body.
If the oxygen level in the blood drops below 90 per cent, he starts having trouble breathing.
However, my acquaintance Dr. Abhishek Bhargava diagnosed me with 'Happy Hypoxia'.
This is a rare symptom of Kovid-19.
'Even though the oxygen level in the body is low, breathing is not difficult, hence the name' Happy Hypoxia '.
However, there is no such thing as being happy.
‘Happy hypoxia’ is a serious condition.
Stealth gradually lowers the level of oxygen in the body, without even realizing it, and the consequences become serious.
I couldn't diagnose it, but, fortunately, my friend diagnosed it on time, which saved my life, 'said Dr. Called Shenoy.
What is 'hypoxia'?
Every cell in our body needs oxygen to survive.
This oxygen is carried from the blood to every cell.
Hypoxia is a decrease in the level of oxygen in the blood.
Blood carries oxygen to the organs of the body.
However, in happy hypoxia, the oxygen required by the cells in the body is not carried by the blood in sufficient quantity.
Is ‘Happy Hypoxia’ Common?
Dr. Shenoy further says, "I have not seen this condition in general in my practice.
I have identified many corona suspected patients and sent them to the hospital.
However, corona has given more information about happy hypoxia condition.
As a result, the oxygen level in the body goes down.
But, as there are no symptoms, it is too late for the bud."
Talking to BBC about this, Infectious Diseases Specialist of Jaslok Hospital, Mumbai, Dr. Om Srivastava says, "Happy hypoxia is found in 10 to 12 per cent of patients with heart disease and lung disease.
If left untreated, it can lead to major complications.
There are many causes of happy hypoxia.
'Many patients come to the hospital with very low oxygen levels.
These patients look normal even when there is less oxygen.
They do not show any symptoms, "said Dr. Srivastava.
Mohan Joshi, superintendent of Nair Hospital, told the BBC: "People with lung disease have low levels of oxygen in their bodies.
These patients are tuned for low oxygen levels.
They look normal, but the amount of oxygen in the body is very critical.
For this, it is very important to go to the community and find a patient.
So that if the amount of oxygen in the body of the people is low, they can be treated immediately by X-rays and other tests, 'said Dr. Joshi continued.
Symptoms of hypoxia
According to Web-MD ,
Skin discoloration,
Confusion situation
Cough, sudden increase in heart rate
Breathing loudly
Sudden sweating
What should the common man do?
It is possible to measure the level of oxygen in the body even if you are at home.
With the help of pulse oximeter we can easily check the oxygen level in the body.
Dr. Shenoy says, "I have experienced 'Happy Hypoxia'.
So I urge everyone to check their oxygen level 10 times a day.
There is no other option but to live with covid infection.
To save lives, have 1 pulse oximeter in every house. It is necessary. '
Timely diagnosis of each disease is of utmost importance.
Former Director of Mumbai Municipal Hospital and Chairman of the Death Audit Committee of the State Government, Dr. Avinash Supe says, "Patients with happy hypoxia look like normal people.
But, while doing an activity, their health suddenly deteriorates.
They suffer from it for some time.
But, after that, they recover.
It is important to diagnose it in time.
Happy hypoxia patients have reduced lung function.
so they have difficulty breathing in the second stage.
And the third stage is the need for a ventilator in the most severe cases, he said, called Supe.
What causes hypoxia?
Pulmonary Physician of Lilavati Hospital, Mumbai, Dr. Jalil Parkar himself got rid of Corona by facing Kovid-19.
Dr. Parakar said, "It is very rare for people to have difficulty breathing despite having very little oxygen in the body.
Severe asthma, lung damage, pneumonia can lead to hypoxia.
While investigating the cause of death due to Covid-19 in the state, the health system has also come to know about 'Happy Hypoxia'.
Speaking to BBC Marathi about 'Happy Hypoxia', the state health commissioner Dr. Anup Kumar Yadav said, "Investigations into the deaths of corona sufferers have revealed several cases of 'happy hypoxia'.
Happy hypoxia can be a manifestation of corona virus.
This trend is found in Mumbai and Maharashtra.
Approximately 2K3% of people have 'happy hypoxia'.
'This patient was coronary.
However, even after the oxygen level in the body decreased, they did not have any difficulty in breathing, 'said Dr. Anup Kumar further said.
We have provided information about 'Happy Hypoxia' in the Death Audit Report of Covid Patients.
Corona: 'Beds should be increased according to the growth rate' - Rajesh Tope
As the number of patients in the state is increasing, so should the number of beds," Health Minister Rajesh Tope said.
"There should be no situation where there are no beds," he said today.
From the Health Services Commissionerate, the Health Minister held a review meeting with the Director of Health, Joint Director, Divisional Deputy Director, District Surgeon, District Health Officer, Taluka Health Officer through video conference.
At this time, the principal secretary of the health department, Dr. Pradeep Vyas, Commissioner Dr. Ramaswamy, Director Dr. Archana Patil, Dr. Sadhana Tayde, Co-Commissioner Dr. Satish Pawar was also present.
He further said, "Institutional quarantine of such persons should be done as the whole house is coronated due to lack of space in the house in home isolation."
A person with coronary heart disease has mild symptoms and if there is a shortage of space in their home, the place where they are segregated is called institutional quarantine.
The administration takes care of a school or a mangal office where the patients are provided with food and medicine.
Regarding the shortage of remedesivir in the state, Tope said, "The task force has formulated regulations on the use of oxygen and remedesivir.
Some doctors are using ramadesivir when there are very mild symptoms.
This makes the shortage appear."
Talking about the shortage of oxygen, Rajesh Tope said, "Hospitals with 50 or more beds should start oxygen production projects and try to become self-sufficient.
At present, efforts are being made to bring in oxygen from outside states.
The companies manufacturing the remedies have reduced the supply.
They are trying to hold a meeting with the central government to talk to Devendra Fadnavis about the supply of the vaccine, Tope said.
Remedicivir will be supplied to private hospitals in view of the active number of patients.
District Surgeons should control both these factors while planning the beds, Tope said.
District Surgeons should pay special attention to ensure that the benefit of Mahatma Jotiba Phule Janaarogya Yojana is not denied to the patients.
He also said that the environment, cleanliness, quality of food, cleanliness of toilets in Kovid Centers should be monitored and if necessary, staff from other departments should be called in to help.
He said awareness-raising about corona is needed, while trying to control those who have symptoms and try to get them to bed.
'Find the cause of rising mortality'
The health minister expressed concern over the rising death rate in the state.
He said, "Find out the reasons for the rising mortality rate in some districts.
Patients are arriving late for treatment and awareness should be created for timely admission so that patients come to the hospital on time as soon as symptoms appear."
He further said that a meeting of private medical professionals in the field of rural hospitals and sub-district hospitals should be convened and the health minister should instruct the patients not to undergo unnecessary treatment while testing the patients immediately.
In many places, positive patients are not taking home isolation seriously, so they should be institutionally isolated, the health minister said.
Corona virus: Corona's double mutation found in 61% of genome sequencing samples
Covid-19 infection is spreading rapidly in Maharashtra.
More than 58,000 corona patients were registered in the state on April 14.
Over the past few days, more than 50,000 corona patients are being registered in the state every day.
The second wave of corona infection is spreading like a tsunami in the state.
At present there are more than 6 lakh active patients in Maharashtra.
Eighty percent of these patients have no symptoms.
However, the number of critically ill patients admitted to the hospital is increasing day by day.
Is the 'double mutation' in the corona virus responsible for the outbreak of corona infection in the state? This question reappears.
Because of this, the report of ‘genome sequencing’ of corona patients is shocking.
The National Institute of Virology (NIV) has informed the state government about the report on 'Genome Sequencing' of Kovid-19 patients in Maharashtra.
What is the NIV report?
Genome sequencing of corona patients is being done at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune.
According to PTI, genome sequencing of 361 coronavirus samples from Maharashtra was done in NIV.
Of these, double mutations were found in 61 per cent of the samples.
Samples of coronaviruses were collected for genome sequencing from January to March.
The Union Ministry of Health had on March 24 informed that a 'double mutation' had been detected in Maharashtra.
Two mutations, E484Q and L452R, have been found in the corona virus.
This mutation was found in 15 to 20 per cent of the samples collected from Maharashtra.
But the central government said there was no concrete evidence that the mutation was the cause of the second wave of infections.
Infection spread due to 'double mutation'?
The second wave of Covid-19 infection in Maharashtra started spreading rapidly in February.
Why is the corona virus spreading so fast?
Genome sequencing was done to find out.
Infectious pathologist from Mumbai, Dr. Ishwari Prasad Gilada says, "This 'double mutation' is very contagious.
It is likely to increase the prevalence of corona infection four to eight times in 3 weeks.
Mutations in the corona virus were found in Amravati, Akola, Yavatmal, Nagpur, Pune and Wardha districts of Vidarbha.
A member of the state's Covid-19 taskforce, Dr. Shashank Joshi said, "This new virus is spreading rapidly.
There is a different pattern of mutated viruses."
According to experts, "E484Q is an escape mutation.
Mutations in the spike protein cause the body's antibodies to recognize the mutated virus to a lesser extent, thus increasing its severity."
So, the L452R mutation, first discovered in the United States, is known to spread rapidly.
The increase in the number of coronavirus patients in the state is putting a huge strain on health facilities.
Due to the high severity of the infection, many people are being hospitalized in critical condition.
The virus is affecting more than one person, he said, Gilada said.
Is 'double mutation' a cause for concern?
Experts say the 'double mutation' found in the corona virus is certainly a cause for concern.
The director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Dr. Anurag Agarwal says, "Double mutations are definitely a cause for concern.
But, it cannot be said for sure that this has led to an increase in the number of patients across the country, or the spread of corona.
This mutation was first detected in February-March."
According to experts, this 'double mutation' found in India has been given the classical name of B.1.617.
Infectious Disease Specialist Dr. Kokilaben Hospital, Mumbai. Tanu Singhal says, "The situation in the state has changed abruptly in the last two months.
It is certain that a new virus has spread.
So one of the reasons for the outbreak is double mutation.
The potential for the new virus to spread is very high."
Experts say the first wave of corona did not infect everyone in the family.
But in the second wave, the whole family appears to be infected with the corona.
There have been several mutations in the corona virus.
But, at the moment, our focus is on two mutations, the E484Q and the L452R, he said.
Anurag Agarwal further said.
Corona: Maharashtra's battle for oxygen, what are the problems and solutions?
here is no need to explain why oxygen is called oxygen in Marathi.
But the corona virus has reminded us of the importance of oxygen.
Regular supply of oxygen to patients has become a major challenge facing the healthcare system in India.
Especially in Maharashtra, there is a shortage of oxygen.
State Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray expressed concern over the issue and while interacting with the public through Facebook on Tuesday, said that he had requested the Center to provide oxygen by air.
But exactly how inflammatory is the situation? What are the problems in oxygen supply and basically what is the benefit of oxygen to covid patients?
How big is the oxygen shortage in Maharashtra?
Considering Maharashtra, the state produces about 1200 metric tons of oxygen per day.
This oxygen is used for medical as well as industrial purposes.
The Chief Minister has said that at present, 100 per cent oxygen is reserved for health facilities in the state in view of Kovid's support.
He also said that currently 950 to 1000 tonnes of oxygen is being used in the state per day.
Despite such a large scale production, there is already a shortage of oxygen in some parts of the state.
Given the growing number of patients in the state, it is a fact that more oxygen will be needed in the coming days.
According to experts, in the next few weeks, Maharashtra may need 1500 to 1600 metric tons of oxygen per day.
But meeting this increased demand for oxygen is not easy.
How is oxygen produced?
When there is an abundance of oxygen (about 21 percent) in the air, you may be wondering how it is produced.
The scientific process behind it is a bit complicated.
But to put it simply, the classical term is converted into a liquid under pressure.
It is easy to separate the components in such liquefied air.
It produces pure and liquid oxygen or nitrogen.
This liquefied oxygen is pale blue in color and very cold.
Its temperature is minus 183 degrees Celsius.
Such superfluous gases are called cryogenic gases .
Although maintaining this temperature is a challenge, it is convenient to store and transport such gases in liquid form.
For this it is filled under pressure in a liquefied oxygen cylinder.
There are 500 such factories in India.
But not all the oxygen it produces is used for medical treatment.
Before Kovid's arrival, only 15 per cent of the oxygen produced in India was used in medical treatment.
The rest of the oxygen was used in oil refining projects or in areas such as the iron industry, car manufacturing, blast furnaces.
The industry was shut down during the lockdown last year, so hospitals continued to be supplied with oxygen.
But after the lockdown, the demand for oxygen from the industry increased.
However, priority is given to hospitals.
At present, more than half of the country's oxygen is used for medical treatment, according to preliminary estimates.
Now that demand has increased, it is not possible to set up new oxygen factories immediately.
Moreover, the question is not only how to increase the production of oxygen, but also how to transport it.
Oxygen transport challenges
Oxygen is supplied by tankers from factories producing oxygen in India.
In some places the tanker is brought directly to the hospital and then oxygen is delivered directly to each bed through a pipe.
In some places, in the refill plant, ie in small factories, the oxygen from the tanker is filled into the cylinders and then the cylinders are supplied to the hospitals.
But in such places the cylinders may need to be changed frequently.
While this arrangement may seem easy to read, there are actually a number of rules to follow when transporting an oxygen cylinder .
Liquid oxygen helps in combustion and therefore care should be taken to avoid any accidents.
It uses a special type of cryogenic tank and a truck that can carry it.
According to the All India Industrial Gas Manufacturers Association, there are about 1,500 such trucks in India.
What are the problems in oxygen transport in Maharashtra?
In Maharashtra, liquid oxygen is produced in a few places like Taloja, Pune and Nagpur near Mumbai.
But from there it takes time to reach other cities.
It takes two and a half to three hours to fill a tanker in a factory that produces oxygen.
So often empty tankers have to stand in line outside the factory.
When the tanker is full, it cannot run fast.
A speed limit of 40 kmph has been imposed on the transport of such tankers.
Also, due to the high number of accidents at night, these tankers do not travel after ten.
In places like Pune in the state, the administration had given oxygen tankers the status of ambulances.
This means that if there is a traffic jam, these trains can go ahead with priority.
But despite such measures, in cities like Nanded, the tankers are getting late, says local journalist Yogesh Latkar.
It takes about 25 hours for the oxygen tankers to reach Nanded from the bottom, 18 hours from Pune and 15 hours from Nagpur.
When an oxygen tanker arrives here, it almost starts filling up in cylinders.
This is what it looks like when a water tanker fills up in a drought prone area.
Ganesh Bhartiya, owner of an oxygen refill plant in Nanded, says, "We used to sell 150 to 200 cylinders a day.
Now the demand has gone up to 500 to 600 cylinders a day.
The oxygen supply to the industry is now cut off and all the cylinders go to hospitals."
He says that he has to work many hours more than usual and it is difficult to meet the demand.
They also say that it may take months for suppliers like you to increase production.
The main reasons are lack of capital, lack of cylinders and lack of manpower.
Skills are needed to handle liquid oxygen, or to supply it to a hospital.
However, an official of the Food and Drug Administration, while talking to BBC Marathi, observed that up to 20 per cent oxygen is being wasted due to lack of practice or leakage in the supply process.
Air transport and other options
When Maharashtra started experiencing scarcity, some oxygen was supplied from neighboring states like Gujarat and Karnataka.
But even this state can stop the supply now as the number of patients is increasing.
According to PTI, Health Minister Rajesh Tope informed about this while talking to reporters in Mumbai.
So the government will now focus on not wasting oxygen.
Meanwhile, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has sought help from the Center, including the option of air transport and military assistance.
In this regard, we contacted Saket Tikku, President, All India Gas Manufacturers Association.
We are in discussions with the government on how to increase the oxygen supply and a decision will be taken soon, he said.
Why do Kovid patients need oxygen supply?
ERV We inhale oxygen through the air.
This oxygen enters the bloodstream through the lungs and reaches the cells through the bloodstream.
There it is chemically processed with glucose, which means food is converted into energy.
This process is the most important for the survival of living things.
In some diseases or if a microbial infection develops in the lungs, it interferes with the process of oxygenation in the blood.
In this case, the oxygen that is inhaled as usual is not enough.
Patients are then supplied with pure oxygen.
In some diseases, oxygen concentrator is used for this purpose.
But one thing to keep in mind.
It is up to the doctor to decide whether the patient needs to take oxygen by machine or cylinder.
This is because pure oxygen can cause some accidents.
What did Raj Thackeray send a letter to Narendra Modi about the corona measures?
MNS president Raj Thackeray has requested the Center to provide 100 per cent vaccination in Maharashtra to combat corona infection.
He has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this regard.
Raj Thackeray said in the letter, "The first wave of Covid-19 and the ensuing national lockout have taken a heavy toll on the people of Maharashtra.
We are still experiencing its economic and social repercussions across the country."
Maharashtra cannot afford to impose repeated restrictions and declarations to stop this new wave.
They are not a permanent solution.
But if the state does not get enough vaccines, what is the alternative?
Against this backdrop, the strategy of 100% vaccination is important and key for Maharashtra if it is to corona infection.
Therefore, with the goal of 100% vaccination in Maharashtra, 100% of people of all ages in the state should be vaccinated as soon as possible. "
Raj Thackeray has suggested some options to provide the necessary vaccines to Maharashtra.
Raj Thackeray has suggested that the state, private institutions in the state should be allowed to buy vaccines separately, and Serum Institute should be allowed to sell freely but with proper regulation in Maharashtra.
Apart from this, organizations like Halfkin and Hindustan Antibiotics should be allowed to produce vaccines in the state, and the state should be given the go-ahead to streamline the supply of medicines like Remedesivir required for the treatment of Covid-19, Raj Thackeray said in the letter.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had said in his speech yesterday (April 13) that he would write a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding oxygen supply in the state.
What are the characteristics of Sputnik-5 vaccine?
How does this vaccine work in the body?
India has paved the way for a third vaccine.
Russia's Sputnik-5 vaccine has been approved by the Union Ministry.
The vaccine was developed by Russia's Gamalaya Center.
Currently, Covishield of Serum Institute and Covacin vaccine of Bharat Biotech are being used in India.
Sputnik will now be the third vaccine available in India.
This decision is considered important considering the increase in the number of patients in India over the last few days.
In addition, in the last few days, many states have been attacking the central government for not supplying vaccines.
The decision is expected to resolve the issue of vaccine supply.
Sputnik-5 vaccine Dr. Russia has said it will give Reddy to the lab. 10 crore dose of Sputnik-5 vaccine Russia has made it clear that it will give Reddy to the lab.
The Russian Direct Investment Fund will cooperate for the clinical trial and distribution of the vaccine.
Russian Direct Investment Fund and Dr. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed between Reddy Labs and 30 crore doses of vaccine will be manufactured in India.
Dr. Reddy is one of the leading pharma companies in the country.
Scientists in Russia have published the first report on vaccine research in the world-renowned medical journal The Lancet .
According to the report, the initial tests of the vaccine in Russia showed signs of an immune response to the vaccine.
The vaccine is said to be 92% successful against covid-19.
The people who took the test tested positive for antibodies against the corona virus.
Notably, this test did not cause any serious side effects.
Such a claim was made by Russian scientists in a report in The Lancet.
The vaccine was developed at the Gamaleya Institute, a government research center in the Russian capital, Moscow.
What else is available about Sputnik-5?
The vaccine was initially the subject of controversy because it was made available to the public before the final test report of the vaccine was available.
But scientists say the benefits of the vaccine are now well-known.
This vaccine uses a cold-like virus.
The virus is harmless but acts as a carrier of the cold-virus to release a small portion of the corona virus into the body.
To the extent that this carrier carries the genetic code of the corona virus to the body, the immune system will recognize and fight the threat in the future, even without getting sick.
Once vaccinated, the body begins to make antibodies.
These antibodies are specially formulated to fight against corona virus.
This means that when a real virus enters the body, these antibodies can fight off promptly.
The vaccine can be stored at a temperature of 2 to 8 C.
The temperature in a simple fridge is around 5 degrees Celsius so the vaccine can be sent here and there in comfort.
A separate vaccine for the second dose
What is different about Sputnik-5 is that the vaccines for the first and second doses are different.
The second dose of the vaccine is slightly different from the first.
Both doses are to be given at intervals of 21 days.
Both doses target the spike of the corona virus but use different vectors.
Vectors are harmless viruses used in vaccines.
The purpose behind using two different formulas to make the vaccine is to boost the immune system.
Giving two doses of two different vaccines instead of two doses of the same vaccine can further boost the immune system and prevent corona for a longer period of time.
This vaccine is effective but there is no risk from it.
The vaccine did not pose any serious risk during the tests.
Of course some side-effects of this vaccine are expected.
But they are mild.
It can cause side effects such as hand pain, fatigue, and mild fever.
But the group of people who were tested for the vaccine did not have any serious illness or death.
In addition to Russia, the Sputnik-5 vaccine is used in Argentina, parts of Palestine, Venezuela, Hungary, the UAE and Iran.
The vaccine is available in India in a few weeks.
Until then, however, the vaccine dollar has survived on only two vaccines, Kovacin and Kovishield.
What is covacin?
Covacin is an inactivated vaccine that uses the dead corona virus.
The vaccine can kill the corona virus if it enters the body, but it does not pose a risk.
The vaccine is manufactured by Bharat Biotech.
Bharat Biotech has over 24 years of experience.
During this time they have made 16 vaccines and exported them to 123 countries.
Bharat Biotech used a sample of corona virus isolated by the National Institute of Virology of India to develop the vaccine.
After vaccination, the body's immune system can detect the structure of the dead corona virus.
This helps the immune system to understand what the corona virus is and how to fight it.
Two doses of this vaccine should be taken every four weeks.
The vaccine can be stored at 2 to 8 C.
Preliminary data from the third round of trials show that the vaccine is 81% effective.
The vaccine was approved in January, which raised eyebrows among many experts.
Bharat Biotech currently has a stock of 2 crore doses and intends to make 70 crore doses over the next year.
Why was Kovacin found in the controversy?
The vaccine was approved in January as an "emergency.
The regulator had said, We are approving the use of the vaccine in emergencies, especially when there are new mutations in the virus, in the public interest, despite ongoing testing of the vaccine."
But experts questioned how the vaccine, which will be given to millions of people as a preventative measure, could be an 'emergency treatment'.
The All India Drug Action Network said at the time, "We are confused as to what could be the scientific reason for approving a vaccine that has not been fully studied.
The lack of complete data is certainly a cause for concern."
But both the manufacturer and the regulator followed Kovacin, saying, "This vaccine is safe and gives a strong immune response."
Bharat Biotech said India's clinical trial laws made it easier for the vaccine to be approved "as soon as possible".
After the second round of tests for the vaccine, "this was done in view of the severity of the life-threatening disease."
What is Covishield?
The vaccine was jointly developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.
The Pune-based Serum Institute of India is responsible for the production of Kovishield.
This is the first vaccine to be approved in India.
We are producing more than 6 crore doses a month, says Serum.
This vaccine is made from a weaker version of the corona virus.
This weak virus is called adenovirus and is found in chimpanzees.
It has been modified to look like a corona virus, but it does not make a person sick.
When the vaccine is injected into the body, it boosts the immune system to make antibodies against the corona virus.
There are also two doses of this vaccine that are expected to be given at 4 to 12 week intervals.
The vaccine can also be stored at 2 to 8 C and can be easily distributed in the current healthcare system.
The vaccine developed by Pfizer-Biotech, on the other hand, has to be stored at temperatures as low as -70 (minus seventy) degrees Celsius and can be moved very rarely.
In a country like India, this is challenging as temperatures can reach up to 50 degrees Celsius in summer.
How effective is Covishield?
Covishield was found to be 90 percent effective after half and then full doses, according to international tests.
But there was not enough data to support the idea of ​​a half-full dose.
Of course, according to unpublished data, the difference between the first and second doses increased by several days.
In the small group on which the experiment was performed, the vaccine was found to be 70 percent effective.
Serum says Kovishield is 'very effective'.
He cited the example of third phase tests in Brazil and the UK.
But the patient rights group All India Action Network says the vaccine has been hastily approved.
The vaccine makers have not studied from an Indian perspective.
What other vaccines are available?
In addition, trials of some vaccines are underway in India.
Ahmedabad-based Zydus-Cadila is currently developing the Zykov-D vaccine.
Hyderabad-based Biological E is the first private vaccine manufacturer in India.
The company is developing a vaccine with Dynavax and Baylor College of Medicine in the United States.
India's first mRNA vaccine HGCO19 is being manufactured in Pune.
The Genoa-based company is partnering with HDT Biotech in the United States to develop a vaccine that uses the genetic code to trigger an immune response.
India is developing a biotech vaccine.
The Serum Institute and American vaccine development company Novavax are working together to develop another.
Which countries will use India's vaccine?
India has sent 6.4 crore doses of vaccines to 86 countries.
These include countries in South America, the Caribbean, Asia, and Africa.
It also includes the UK, Canada, Brazil and Mexico.
Both covshield and covacin vaccines are being exported.
Some doses are given as a 'gift' because vaccine companies and countries that receive vaccines have entered into some agreements.
The remaining vaccines are being sent under the Covax scheme.
Kovacs is led by the World Health Organization and hopes to deliver more than two billion doses to people in 190 countries in the coming year.
But in March 2021, India banned the export of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines.
The government has banned exports of vaccines to India due to rising demand in the country due to rising cases in the country.
Corona Lockdown: Does Corona Spread if the Store Is Open?
Lockdown is being considered at the government level as corona infection is on the rise in the state.
Traders in the state staged agitation against the decision.
Merchants in Pune had also decided to open shops today.
But a meeting of traders took place late last night.
It has decided to postpone the decision to open shops till today.
Also, after the decision of today's meeting of the Chief Minister, the next role will be decided by the traders.
Fatehchand Ranka, president of the Pune Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has raised some questions against the government's decision to close shops.
We have the answers to those questions from the state health advisor Dr. Attempts have been made to get it from Subhash Salunke.
Traders claim experts answer him
1. Vegetable market is open, corona can spread even from food stalls, so why are there no restrictions on them?
If the trader or employee is a super spreader, the risk of spreading from him is higher.
People are in the shops for a long time so they are more likely to get infected.
While many shops do not have adequate ventilation, many stores have AC so spread can be widespread.
The vegetable market can also be spread by food vendors, but the main difference is that the vegetable market is in an open space, with shops closed.
Corona will not happen in one place and it will not happen in a particular place at all but if the shops continue it can spread more.
It is claimed that the shop continued to be crowded.
Factories are open, there are hundreds of people working there, they go by the same bus, they can also cause infections.
There is a difference between the number of employees working in factories and the number of employees that traders have and the number of customers that come to them.
Not all the blame lies with the traders, but it is important to close in places where more people can come together.
E-commerce is allowed.
Delivery boys can go from house to house delivering goods, they can also spread the corona.
The order stipulates that delivery boys must be tested when allowing e-commerce, so they will be able to work only after testing.
The situation in Pune is deteriorating.
The trade has been closed for the last eight days, but the number of patients does not appear to have decreased.
The results will not be seen in eight days.
The effect is visible only after a fortnight of lockdown.
Only then does it help to break the chain.
We will have to wait a few days for the results to appear.
Corona also happens from wedding ceremonies, political gatherings, why there are no restrictions on them?
Weddings and political gatherings should be closed completely.
Marriage to 50 people should also be canceled.
Marriages, political events can be avoided or postponed.
Postponing weddings and political events for a few months will not make any difference.
Why is the spread of corona increasing rapidly?
Mutations of the corona virus have occurred in Maharashtra and that is why it is spreading on a large scale, said former state president of IMA, Dr. Avinash Bhondwe expressed this while talking to BBC Marathi.
Currently, there is a double mutation in the corona virus.
Its spread has more than doubled.
At the same time, the symptoms of the corona have changed.
Redness, itching, and diarrhea are new symptoms.
People between the ages of 20 and 25 are more likely to be infected. "
Does closing the shop stop the spread of corona?
Contact tracing is not done properly.
There should be contact tracing of 20 people for a positive patient, it is only five at present.
Therefore, the spread is increasing due to asymptomatic patients, Said Bhondwe.
Trade electronically
If the shops open, there will be crowds and so the corona is likely to spread.
Bhondwe also thinks that the spread of corona can be reduced if traders continue to trade using electronic methods, such as home delivery or making appointments to specific people at specific times.
Mumbai Municipal Corporation will do 8 things to prevent corona
The prevalence of corona is increasing rapidly in Mumbai and Maharashtra.
Mumbai Municipal Corporation, the most populous city in Maharashtra, is taking steps to curb corona.
Mumbai Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal while giving information about this, said what will be emphasized by the Municipal Corporation.
The Mumbai Municipal Commissioner said that priority will be given to save the lives of patients.
At present, there are 325 additional beds available in Mumbai and now there are a total of 2466 ICU beds, Chahal said.
Mumbai Municipal Corporation will do 8 things to prevent corona:
Nodal officers will be appointed in 24 wards, special attention will be given especially from 11 pm to 7 am
At night mainly all the beds will be given in Jumbo Hospital
If a patient who calls at night does not have a covid report or is not tested, they will also be given a bed as a suspect
Try to stabilize if oxygen is needed
Labs are instructed to report within 24 hours
Preference should be given to reports of symptoms
Instructions for setting up Covid Care Center in Four and Five Star Hotels
1100 beds and 125 ICU beds will be made available in next 7 days
In the next 5-6 weeks, 3 Jumbo Centers will be set up with 2000 beds, 200 ICUs and 70 per cent oxygen beds.
Meetings from Uddhav Thackeray, what will be the decision and when?
Given the growing prevalence of corona in Maharashtra, clear indications have been given by the state government to impose lockdown.
However, it is not yet clear when the lockdown will be announced.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting of all party leaders in Maharashtra on April 10, followed by a meeting with the task force set up on the occasion of Corona on April 11.
Today (April 12), the Chief Minister is expected to take stock of the economic situation by interacting with the state finance ministry.
As the number of corona patients in Maharashtra is increasing by 50,000, the Chief Minister is discussing with everyone to impose more stringent restrictions or to check the option of lockdown.
However, it is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.
In an all-party meeting on April 10, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said, The number of patients is increasing so fast that if no decision is taken today, the situation will automatically be like tomorrow.
Important meeting with the task force
The task force meeting discussed issues related to availability of oxygen, use of remedicivir, availability of beds, treatment modalities, enhancement of facilities, imposition of restrictions, strict punitive action.
The meeting was attended by Health Minister Rajesh Tope, Medical Education Minister Amit Deshmukh, Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte, Task Force's Dr. Sanjay Oak, Dr. Shashank Joshi, Dr. Avinash Supe, Dr. Tatyarao Lahane, Principal Secretary Health Dr. Pradeep Vyas, Medical Education Secretary Sourav Vijay were present.
'Creation of SOP started'
In a meeting of the task force, the Chief Minister said, "Over the last year, we have been fighting Kovidis to increase facilities, increase tests, raise awareness on large-scale health regulations.
There is also awareness among the people.
Basically, the number of patients is increasing rapidly.
Asymptomatic people are spreading the disease among the people.
People who follow the health rules are at risk due to careless people, lockdown should be stopped," he said.
Methods (SOP) will be prepared, "said the Chief Minister.
"Now we are in the forefront of vaccination but we will speed up and vaccinate as many people as possible. But this vaccination will be useful to prevent the third wave coming in the near future.
What did Rajesh Tope say after the task force meeting?
The lockdown situation has arisen in the state, said Health Minister Rajesh Tope while talking to media.
An important meeting between Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and the Covid Task Force Committee was held today (April 11). 
The meeting discussed the Corona situation in the state.
Speaking to media after the meeting, Rajesh Tope said, "The situation of lockdown is now prevailing in the state, so how to deal with the lockdown situation, how to solve any problem of the people, how many days if lockdown is to be imposed." He said, "Of course, all this has only been discussed.
But the lockdown situation has arisen in the state.
The members of the task force were of the view that the Chief Minister will now discuss with the Finance and other departments. . "
Corona Virus: Why is there a shortage of Remedesivir in Maharashtra?
The central government announced the second wave of corona in Maharashtra.
The number of corona patients has gone from hundreds to thousands and now to millions.
Again patients are feeling the lack of beds, ventilators, oxygen in the hospital.
Along with this deficiency, there is a great shortage of 'Remedesivir' injections.
The state government estimates that the state is currently experiencing an increase in the supply of about 50,000 remedesivir injections per day due to the growing number of corona patients.
If the number of patients continues to grow, 1.5 lakh injections a day may be required by the end of April.
As a result, the production of these injections is declining.
Why is this injection given?
Why is its production declining?
How is Remedesivir black marketed?
What is the condition of people without these injections?
This report ..
What is Remedesivir?
Remedesivir injection is considered to be effective in patients with corona infection.
It was recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an effective remedy for Covid-19 patients.
This injection was allowed to be used in Maharashtra from 30 June 2020.
Cipla (Mumbai), Hetro Healthcare (Hyderabad), Jubilant Lifesciences (Delhi), Ilia Laboratories (Argentina), Dr. Reddycevir injections of six companies namely Reddy's (Hyderabad), Zydus Cadila (Ahmedabad) are being used in Maharashtra.
This injection is given to a patient with a more serious infection as it affects the corona patients.
J. J. The head of the hospital's pharmacology team, Dr. Madhukar Gaikwad says, "Corona infection occurs in the lungs.
HRCT is used to check the extent of the infection.
It has a score.
A score of 5 out of 25 is not considered serious.
Infected patients are given Remedesivir injection.
There is no age condition.
Those who are more infected are given the injection.
However, it is not given to pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers.
What are the reasons for the shortage?
Remedesivir injection is currently supplied by 6 companies.
There are 4 companies that supply more.
The raw material required for this injection has to be imported.
It is not available in India.
Therefore, the process of production from import of raw materials is huge.
Sushil Mali, district organizer of the Maharashtra Registered Drug Dealers Association (MRPS), says, "For the last several days, there has been no supply of Remedesivir injections.
"Where there is a demand for 500 injections, there is a supply of 60-70 injections in two days.
Some companies do not supply these private hospitals.
Therefore, the demand for these injections has increased from the relatives of the patients treated in private hospitals.
He further says, "This injection can be stored for 6 months.
Now the limit has been increased to 12 months.
But earlier it could not be stored as there was a limit of 6 months."
The injection is given to a person with a serious infection of the corona.
However, the state government has observed that in some hospitals, patients who do not have symptoms or do not need them are being given remedicivir injections.
What is the state government doing in this regard?
State Health Minister Rajesh Tope said, "The injection molding companies have started increasing production.
It will take at least 20 days to complete the process.
After that, there will be no shortage of remedesivir in the state.
We have agreed to supply stocks to Maharashtra.
At the same time, 70% of the company's products are being supplied to Maharashtra. "
'Remedesivir injection of 40 thousand'
My 74-year-old mother contracted corona.
The lung infection was very high.
The doctor advised her to be admitted to the hospital immediately ...
a person living in Navi Mumbai told BBC Marathi.
He further said, "I took my mother to a hospital in Dombivli.
The doctors started injecting remedicivir.
We got the injection on the first day but the next day the hospital asked us to give the injection.
So I went around.
Despite the black market, my mother's health was important to me, so I bought five such remedicivir injections at Rs 40,000 for Rs 8,000 and completed my mother's treatment. "
The story of the householders living in Pune was similar.
He described his brother's condition on condition of anonymity.
His 42-year-old brother was hospitalized.
The HRCT test score was 12 out of 25.
The doctor told him that he needed to be given 6 injections of remedivir.
I visited all the reputed hospitals in Pune.
I could not find any remedicavir anywhere.
I went to Poona Hospital for injections.
There was a queue of 150-200 people like me.
Then I bought the injections from a chemist for 2200 and 3000.
Trying to stop the black market?
The state health department has said that remedesivir injection should be sold for Rs 1,100 to Rs 1,400.
But that doesn't seem to be happening.
One injection is available on the black market at Rs 4,000 to Rs 8,000.
The Food and Drug Administration has launched raid sessions to stop the massive black market.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has appealed to the concerned district administration to call the toll free number 1800-222-365 if any patient is not getting Remedesivir injection or if it is being black marketed.
Food and Drug Administration Minister Rajendra Shingane has directed the authorities to take stern action against the black marketeers.
Is Maharashtra being harmed in the case of Corona vaccine?
Vaccination has created a conflict between the Maharashtra government and the central government.
On the other hand, it was time to stop vaccination in many districts of the state.
The Maharashtra government claims that the Center is treating Maharashtra as a scapegoat, this is a call of the state government and now the state leaders are arguing over the cause of the vaccine due to the failure to control the infection.
The state government claims that Maharashtra is not getting vaccinated compared to the speed of vaccination, the affected population and the total population.
The central government says that Maharashtra has been given the highest number of vaccines in the country.
But when such allegations are rebutted, the numbers tell the truth.
First 7 lakhs, then 17 lakhs
Vaccines are supplied to every state by the Central Government across the country and vaccination program is implemented as per the rules laid down by the Center.
Every week the stock is given to the states by the central government for selected days.
The Maharashtra government claims that the number of vaccines given to Maharashtra this week is meager.
The BJP-ruled states have been given more, while Maharashtra, where the infection is highest, has been given less.
The distribution figures of vaccines produced by Covishield, a serum institute, for the period April 15 to April 20, shed light on this information.
According to the schedule, Madhya Pradesh has the highest supply of vaccines at 33.76,220, Uttar Pradesh at 44,98,450, West Bengal at 21,05,970, Haryana at 24,68,920 and Karnataka at 29,06,240.
It was planned to supply 7,43,280 vaccines to Maharashtra for this period.
A comparison of the positive cases on the government's website and the planned supply figures shows that Maharashtra's supply was less planned than other states during this period.
From the figures, it seems that those who had more supply planned, except Bengal, are ruled by BJP.
But in Maharashtra, where the number of infections is increasing rapidly, there is a shortage of vaccines.
The Maharashtra government has openly expressed its displeasure.
Such a colorful struggle between the center and the state
As the supply of vaccine to Maharashtra was declining, the state leaders were demanding that the central government send stocks of vaccine as soon as possible.
Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday (April 7) criticized the Maharashtra government for not being serious about the Corona health crisis while raising the issue of vaccine shortage.
Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan issued a press release in this regard.
In it, he said, "While witnessing the corona virus, I have personally witnessed the mismanagement and pertinent attitude of the Maharashtra government.
The Central Government regularly counseled the Government of Maharashtra on the background of Corona.
Provided them with all the resources.
He also sent central teams to help.
But now it is clear that there is a lack in the efforts of the Maharashtra government itself, said Harshvardhan.
On Thursday, April 8, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray again raised the issue of vaccines in a meeting of the Prime Minister with all the Chief Ministers.
Sharad Pawar also had a talk with Union Health Minister Dr. Harshvardhan.
The controversy between Maharashtra and the Center was discussed all over the country.
Then on Thursday night the immunization department of the health ministry announced revised planning.
Accordingly, Maharashtra was given 10 lakh stocks of additional vaccines.
Accordingly, the state will now receive 17,43,280 vaccines for this week.
Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope also informed about it.
But considering the need and speed of vaccination, Maharashtra has demanded 40 lakh vaccines per week from the Center.
Most vaccinations and immunizations in Maharashtra
On the other hand, the central government and BJP leaders in the states have categorically denied that there is any harm in Maharashtra.
According to him, Maharashtra has the highest supply of vaccines than any other state.
He has criticized the allegations that Maharashtra is being harmed only because it is a non-BJP government.
Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Devendra Fadnavis said in a tweet on Thursday that "only three states have been given more than one crore vaccines till date: Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan.
Gujarat and Rajasthan have the same population and in Rajasthan the Congress is in power."
The supply of vaccines depends not only on the population but also on the effectiveness of vaccination in the state.
The Maharashtra Directorate of Information said in a tweet on April 6 that the state had received 1.06 crore vaccines.
91 lakh out of which was given.
Statistics also confirm that most vaccinations have been done in Maharashtra.
According to the latest figures on the Union Health Ministry's website and the 'Covin' portal, 93,93,352 people have been vaccinated in Maharashtra till noon on April 9.
Rajasthan is second only to Maharashtra in vaccinating 88 lakh people.
But in the supply phase from which the controversy started, the states that have received the most vaccines are lagging behind in terms of statistical performance.
81.4 lakh people have been vaccinated in Uttar Pradesh, 52.34 lakh in Madhya Pradesh, 54.63 lakh in Karnataka and 84.75 lakh in Gujarat.
If performance is determined by vaccination statistics and supply is based on performance, then these official figures tell a different story.
But the state is also at loggerheads over the issue of wastage of vaccine.
Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said that 6 per cent vaccine was wasted in Maharashtra.
However, Rajesh Tope tweeted that the number given by Javadekar is the national average and the rate of vaccine wastage in Maharashtra is less than half of the national average.
Corona vaccine: What happens if the second dose of vaccine is delayed?
Health Minister Rajesh Tope's announcement that there are not enough stocks of vaccine available in Maharashtra has raised many questions about the second dose of vaccine.
Health Minister Rajesh Tope said that there is enough stock of corona vaccine available in Maharashtra till April 9-10.
He said, "On Wednesday (April 7), 14 lakh vaccines were available. Today, there are 9 lakh vaccines left.
After April 15, 17 lakh vaccines will be available.
That quantity is also low."
Vaccination started in the country from 16th January 2021.
The vaccine needs to be taken in two doses for the body to produce antibodies and for the vaccine to be effective.
The Central Health Department has also clarified that the second dose is expected to be taken six to eight weeks after the first dose of the vaccine.
However, what to do if the person who took the first dose of the vaccine did not get the second dose in time due to lack of vaccine?
Can it have any effect on health?
If a second dose is not obtained, will the antibodies needed to fight the corona virus not be produced?
If the second dose is not received in time, where should I report it?
And if the first dose is taken with one vaccine, and the vaccine is not available, but the second is available, should the second dose be given with a different vaccine?
We will try to find out the answers to these questions from experts.
1. If the first vaccine is taken but the second vaccine (second dose of vaccine) is not available or not available within a period of six to eight weeks, can it have any effect on health?
It has been two and a half months since vaccination started in the country.
From April 1, all citizens in India over the age of 45 will also be vaccinated.
As a result, a large number of citizens were vaccinated.
Health Minister Rajesh Tope clarified that now there is a shortage of vaccine.
Therefore, citizens are skeptical about getting a second dose of the vaccine.
WHO, Washington Post praises Maharashtra - Rajesh Tope
The second vaccine (second dose of vaccine) is to be given about six to eight weeks after the first vaccination.
But if this period is reversed and the vaccine is not available, there is no reason to panic, say medical experts from the state health department.
The survey officer of the state health department, Dr. Speaking to BBC Marathi, Pradip Awate said, "Even if the second vaccine is not received in time, it will not affect the health.
Therefore, citizens should not worry about it.
But it is very important to get another vaccine." Even so, he clarified.
But such a situation does not exist in Maharashtra, claims the director of the Maharashtra Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), Tatyarao Lahane has done it.
He also said that getting the first vaccine and not getting the second vaccine does not happen.
Speaking to BBC Marathi, Dr Tatyarao Lahane said, "Even if we do not get a second dose of vaccine, it will not affect our health.
Currently there is some stock of vaccine and there will be a supply of vaccines in the coming days.
So there is no reason to worry, he said.
A second vaccine is automatically provided for the first vaccinated person, said Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the State Action Force (Corona Task Force), head of the College of Physicians and a senior diabetic, while speaking to BBC Marathi.
He said, "There is no shortage of second doses.
The government has reserved a second dose for the first dose.
So I think this fear is artificial.
Even in rural areas, such a situation will not arise for a second dose."
Also, according to the World Health Organization, the second dose of the vaccine should be given in two or three months, he said.
2. What happens if I do not get or take the second dose of vaccine?
Adequate and sufficient antibodies are needed in the body to fight the corona virus.
Dr. Pradeep Awate says, "Without a second vaccine, the body will not produce enough antibodies.
Therefore, the vaccine will not have as much effect on the body as it should to fight the virus.
In short, just one vaccine will not be effective."
He adds, "According to the information we have received so far, the covshield vaccine provides 71 percent protection from the corona.
But this protection is obtained after taking both doses of the vaccine."
3. Where to complain if I do not get a second dose of vaccine?
There is no denying the possibility of difficulty getting a second dose of the vaccine in the near future.
This is because the administration is saying that the stock of vaccine has run out in many districts or it is insufficient.
If you do not get a second dose of the vaccine, you should report it to the relevant vaccination center.
You are expected to get a second vaccine at the same place where the first vaccine was given.
You should then go to the same center and get vaccinated.
That is what Dr. Pradeep Awate says.
Dr. Shashank Joshi says that you can also report on the Covin (Co-WIN) app used for registration or appointment for vaccines.
The Covin app has all the information and contacts about the vaccine.
You can use it to register your complaint. Even so, he said.
4. If the first dose is of one vaccine, and the vaccine is not available, but the second is available, should the second dose be of a different vaccine?
Experts from the health department clarified that this cannot be done and there is no such provision.
Dr. Pradeep Awate, Survey Officer, Health Department, said, "Two doses of vaccine cannot be given by different companies.
The first dose is for one vaccine and the second dose is not for another company.
Therefore, citizens should not do this."
Dr. Shashank Joshi, a member of the State Action Committee, clarified that such facility is not available even at the vaccination centers.
Uddhav Thackeray demanded these things from Narendra Modi to fight Corona
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should give an understanding to the political parties not to bring any politics in the Corona fight.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi today (April 8) interacted with the Chief Ministers of the states through video conferencing.
Union Health Minister Dr. due to the shortage of vaccines in the state. Harshvardhan alleged that the Mahavikas Alliance government failed to handle the situation in Corona.
Due to this, the match between the state government and the central government was played all day long.
Against this backdrop, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said that Maharashtra was nowhere behind to fight the Corona and demanded that politics should not be allowed to take place on these issues.
Uddhav Thackeray has demanded that 40 lakh vaccines be supplied to Maharashtra every week.
Uddhav Thackeray also demanded that the central government supply vaccines as per demand and provide oxygen and ventilators.
Uddhav Thackeray also said that the Center should approve the proposal sent by the state government to the Halfkin Institute to produce the vaccine as soon as possible.
What has increased the number of patients in Maharashtra?
Of the total tests conducted in the state so far, 71 per cent have been RTPCR and 28 per cent antigen tests.
However, the Union Health Secretary has suggested that the government increase the number of tests.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray admitted that Corona's support has increased in Maharashtra due to Gram Panchayat elections and weddings.
He said, "In the mean time, we managed to stem the tide of infection.
At that time, there were only 3,000 patients in Maharashtra.
Maharashtra, like all other major states, took care of it.
The whole family became infected. "
While the situation in the state is becoming normal, the infection has increased due to mutations in the virus.
The experience is the same all over the world.
Uddhav Thackeray also asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to increase the number of RTPCR tests to more than 70 per cent and speed up vaccination but with the help of the central government.
'Supply vaccine on demand'
Uddhav Thackeray has demanded that 40 lakh vaccines be supplied to Maharashtra every week.
He also said that the objective is to vaccinate about 1.77 crore people in the priority group in the state.
So far, the state has received 1 crore 6 lakh 23 thousand 500 doses.
Also, 92 to 95 lakh doses have been given till date.
However, at present, Maharashtra has very few stocks and some vaccination centers are closed, said Uddhav Thackeray.
It was also demanded that 17.43 lakh doses be given after April 15, as the central government had said, and that the vaccination drive would be hampered, so that full distribution should be done simultaneously as per our demand.
The demand to vaccinate everyone above 25 years was also mentioned.
Also need oxygen, ventilator and remedivir
The state is in dire need of oxygen and the central government has been asked to supply it.
Given the current number of coronary heart disease patients, the demand for oxygen is estimated at 1700-2500 MT by the end of April.
Therefore, to keep the supply smooth, it is urgent to supply liquid medical oxygen to Maharashtra, said Uddhav Thackeray.
The meeting also demanded supply of remedivasir from drug manufacturers across the country and control of the price of the drug by the drug controller.
About 50 to 60 thousand bottles of Remedesivir are in use in Maharashtra.
Given the number of active patients, this need could increase to 90,000 to 1 lakh bottles per day by the end of April.
The ICMR has asked the central government to make a rule on the use of remedicivir and stop the export of the drug as remedicivir is being given only to CT scanned patients in many places.
It was also demanded that another 1,200 ventilators be provided in the state.
The ventilators ordered by the Center were said to be closed due to technical reasons.
The state government has set up Hafkin Biopharmaceutical Corporation Ltd.
The Parel-based organization has sent a proposal to the central government to produce covacin.
Uddhav Thackeray also said that it should be accepted as soon as possible so that the vaccine can be supplied.
Detailed details of Maharashtra
As on March 1, 2021, 75,000 tests were being conducted every day in the state.
The same number has gone up to more than 2 lakh tests in the last 3 days.
Currently, 1.25 lakh RTPCR tests are being conducted daily.
On April 7, 2 lakh 35 thousand 749 tests were conducted in the state, which included 1 lakh 33 thousand 344 RTPCRs and 1 lakh 2 thousand 405 antigens.
The death rate among corona patients in the state was 1.69 per cent in January, 0.82 per cent in February and 0.37 per cent in March.
From April 1 to April 7, the mortality rate is 0.55 per cent with 3 lakh 60 thousand 281 patients.
At present there are 5 lakh 1 thousand 559 active patients in the state.
60% of patients are in home segregation and 40% in institutional segregation.
4.32 percent of active patients are on oxygen while less than 1 percent of patients are on ventilators.
Isolation beds for corona patients in the state are currently 80.51 per cent full.
17.17 per cent beds have been filled for suspected patients.
Oxygen beds are 32.77 per cent full, ICU beds are 60.95 per cent full and at present 33.97 per cent ventilators are installed.
Uddhav Thackeray government is ignoring Corona for recovery- Dr. Harshavardhana
The shortage of vaccines in Maharashtra has started a new controversy against the central government and the state's Mahavikas Aghadi government.
Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has criticized the Maharashtra government for not being serious about the Corona health crisis.
Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has issued a press release in this regard .
I have personally witnessed the mismanagement and pertinent attitude of the Maharashtra government in the fight against the corona virus.
The lack of a state government has hit the entire country's anti-corona campaign, he said.
What exactly did the Union Health Minister say?
The Central Government regularly counseled the Government of Maharashtra on the background of Corona.
Provided them with all the resources.
He also sent central teams to help.
But now it is clear that there is a lack in the efforts of the Maharashtra government itself, said Harshvardhan.
He also blamed the government for the increase in the number of patients and death rate in Maharashtra.
He said, "Today, Maharashtra has the highest number of corona patients and deaths in the country.
Not only that, but Maharashtra also has the highest number of positive cohort tests in the world.
In this press release, he also targeted Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.
The government's performance is not good even for health workers and essential service workers.
The government is giving relief from institutional quarantine for personal recovery.
It is shocking to see that this is increasing the risk to the people of Maharashtra.
Overall, the state is stuck in one crisis after another.
It looks like.
He made such a criticism.
'... then vaccination has to be stopped'
As the supply of vaccine to Maharashtra is declining, the central government is demanding that the central government send stocks of vaccine as soon as possible.
Health Minister Rajesh Tope has admitted that there is a shortage of anti-covid vaccines in the state.
"The state has enough stocks of vaccines for three days.
If the vaccines are not received in three days, vaccination will stop," Tope told reporters.
The second wave of Covid-19 caused a blast of corona infection in Maharashtra.
At present, there are more than 4 lakh 70 thousand active corona patients in the state.
Vaccination has been stopped in some districts of the state due to non-availability of vaccine.
Corona infection is spreading rapidly across the state.
The mini-lockdown has been caused by the spread of corona infection in urban and rural areas.
Out of 10 Covid-19 hotspot districts in the country, 7 districts are in Maharashtra.
Therefore, Maharashtra has become a hotspot for corona infection in the country.
Corona Mumbai: After finding so many patients, the society will become a micro-containment zone?
A micro containment zone is being set up in Mumbai to curb the growing contagion of corona virus and the rules for the same have been announced by the Mumbai Municipal Corporation.
Rules for micro containment zones
A co-operative society with 5 or more active covid-19 patients will be designated as a "micro-containment zone" and the society will be sealed.

Maharashtra Lockdown: What exactly are the restrictions for private offices?
In Maharashtra, the second wave of corona has started very fast and intensely.
Yesterday (March 4) in one day 57 thousand patients were found in Maharashtra.
It also shows the intensity of the wave.
To curb the second wave of corona, the Maharashtra government has imposed some restrictions from today (March 5), calling it a 'break the chain'.
Even though restrictions have been imposed, there is still some confusion among many.
Many have questioned the rules on social media, especially with regard to private establishments.
We are going to remove this confusion.
Let us understand in detail exactly what the government has said in its order regarding the new restrictions.
Private offices
The Maharashtra government's order on restrictions has clearly given some instructions under the separate heading 'Offices'.
It said all private offices would remain closed except for the following.
Co-operative Banks, Public Sector Banks and Private Banks
BSE and NSE
Companies related to power supply
Telecom service provider
Airlines and Mediclaim companies
Pharmaceutical company offices for production and distribution management
The Maharashtra government has made it clear that except for the above six things, private offices will remain closed.
The last instruction in the same headline says that employees in private and government offices should be vaccinated immediately as per government norms.
So that the government can resume offices.
Factory and manufacturing unit
The manufacturing sector is important for private sector jobs, including private offices.
Let's see what the restrictions are.
The manufacturing sector, the manufacturing sector, can continue with certain rules, the government said in the order. Then the following rules are applied to it:
Before admitting any worker to the factory and manufacturing unit, his body temperature should be measured.
All employees from managerial level should be vaccinated as per government norms.
If a worker / employee is found to be corona positive, all employees who come in contact with him should be quarantined.
Factories with more than 500 employees should set up their own quarantine facility.
If an employee is found to be corona positive, the unit concerned should be shut down until it is completely sanitized.
Divide between lunch and break times, so that there will be no crowds.
The dining area should not be combined.
Common toilet facilities should be kept clean.
All workers should be vaccinated as per government norms.
Also, a negative RTPCR report will be accepted for 15 days.
This rule will be effective from 10 April 2021.
If an employee is infected with corona, he should be given medical leave.
He should not be fired.
Construction area
Another important sector for private sector workers is construction.
The government has laid down some rules for construction under a separate heading.
Workers on the construction site where they live are allowed to continue working on the site.
However, if some things need to be taken in or out, then the work has to be stopped.
It also does not prohibit the import of material.
All workers working on construction sites should be vaccinated as per government norms.
Also, a negative RTPCR report will be accepted for 15 days.
This rule will be effective from 10 April 2021.
If the rules are not followed, the developer will be fined Rs 10,000.
If the same mistakes are made again, the site will be shut down.
If a worker is found to be corona positive, he or she should be granted paid medical leave.
He cannot be fired.
Meanwhile, some private office work now takes place from home, from work to home.
But there are many offices whose work cannot be done from home.
The question of what they want to do remains unanswered.
BBC Marathi spoke to Vikas Satpute, a human resource officer at a BPO company in Mumbai.
According to him, "Work from a company like BPO is not possible because there is constant monitoring of employees.
The work is done according to the target.
Not only BPOs, but there are many companies where work from is not possible, Satpute told the BBC.
Corona: What is Home Quarantine? What to do to prevent others from being infected with the corona virus?
Patients with non-coronary symptoms and mild symptoms are allowed to undergo 'home quarantine'.
The state government has published new rules for this.
What exactly is a home quarantine?
And what to take care of after home quarantine?
Everyone has this question.
Let us know the answers to these questions.
Where did the word 'quarantine' come from?
The 14th century was plagued by plague in many parts of the world.
During this time many boats from all over the world entered the port of Venice.
No one on board was diagnosed with a plague or other contagious disease during these 40 days, and only then were the sailors allowed to disembark.
The original Italian word 'quarantine' means - 40, and hence the word 'quarantine'.
The same word is constantly ringing in our ears.
Patients infected with corona are quarantined.
For this, the government has set up quarantine centers in various places.
But with this, the government has started offering the option of home isolation or home quarantine.
But who exactly is quarantined or isolated at home?
What care should be taken while doing this?
If someone becomes a home quarantine, is there any danger to others in the house?
This is what we are going to learn.
What exactly is quarantine and isolation?
In Marathi, 'quarantine' is called segregation and isolation is called segregation.
Quarantine is performed on individuals who have come in contact with corona patients and who have mild or very mild symptoms.
Asymptomatic patients, whose reports are positive, are treated with mild symptoms or asymptomatic patients with no symptoms at all.
Why are these people kept apart?
No one else should be infected with the corona virus, so these people are isolated.
It is a contagious disease.
It can be spread by microscopic snowflakes while speaking, sneezing or coughing.
That is why this cowardly suspect or infected person needs to be isolated.
On the one hand, the number of patients is increasing, but on the other hand, the central government has changed the rules of quarantine.
Patients with or without mild symptoms have the option of having a separate room, separate toilet at home if they have the necessary facilities at home.
This requires the consent of the patient and you need to fill out an affidavit.
Government of Maharashtra Rules for Home Isolation
Asymptomatic means that patients with no symptoms, no comorbidities but mild corona symptoms can be isolated at home.
The patient needs to be medically certified to have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.
Even if a person with senile age or comorbidities does not show symptoms of corona, a decision about home isolation will be made after consultation with the person's family doctor.
This patient needs to be cared for at home day and night.
There should be a communication system (telephone, mobile) between the caregiver and the treating hospital.
A corona positive person will have to answer a phone call from the municipal or health system, IVR.
Caregivers and all close family members should take hydroxychloroquine in accordance with the protocol of medical authorities.
It is mandatory to inform the patient to the team coming for the survey at home.
The person being isolated should have a pulse oximeter, thermometer, face mask, gloves, sanitizer.
What should a person with a home quarantine do?
If it is not possible to be alone in a room full time, the most important thing is to stay away from senior citizens in the house, pregnant women, children and other people with comorbidities.
Personal Hygiene - Follow hygiene, and take medications on time.
Do not take any medicine without doctor's advice.
Limit your activities at home.
Use a mask at home.
Don't mix with people by mistake, don't go out of the house.
If you live alone in a room, try to follow your routine.
And keep the mind engaged.
Next, let's look at what a home quarantine person or caregiver is expected to do.
The Department of Health, Government of India has issued some guidelines in this regard.
This home isolation option is offered only to patients who are being cared for at home.
That is why the role of this caregiver is important.
Everything used by the patient should be different.
Keep their dinner plate separate.
Wash patient's clothes, dishes, cups, bedsheets, towels separately.
When feeding the patient, use masks and gloves when cleaning the room.
Dispose of it properly after one use.
Only one person in the family should take care of this patient.
If the patient is experiencing mild symptoms, it is difficult to see if the symptoms are getting worse.
If the patient has difficulty breathing, chest pain, loss of appetite, blue face or lips, seek immediate medical attention, visit the hospital.
Start taking hydroxychloroquine on the advice of medical authorities.
The patient's room should be cleaned daily with a solution of 1% sodium hypochlorite, and the toilet and other surfaces should be cleaned with a solution of bleach.
Exactly how many days do you want to stay in Home Quarantine?
You need to observe home quarantine for 17 days from the onset of symptoms.
The sample for testing should be counted for 17 days from the day it was taken and then for 10 consecutive days if there is no fever, the person is exempted from home segregation.
The guidelines issued by the Maharashtra government state that there is no need to re-test the home quarantine period.
When to go to the hospital?
Monitor the health of the person in isolation at home.
If this person starts having problems, contact a doctor immediately.
Contact a doctor if you find these :
Difficulty breathing
Pulse Oximeter - A finger-level oxygen level monitor if the level is below 95
Fever over 100.40 Fahrenheit (38 C) for 24 hours
Fatigue after 6 minutes of walking
Feeling of constant chest pain or pressure
Sensation of face or limbs
Feeling confused, having trouble speaking
Blue scars on face or lips
How to maintain mental health?
Even if the patient is at home during home quarantine or isolation, he and others in the household may experience stress, experts say.
Renowned psychiatrist Dr. Speaking to BBC Marathi, Manoj Bhatwadekar said, "If we want to maintain mental health in this time, it is important to keep the mind in the present as much as possible.
For this, a good daily routine should be followed, including adequate diet, adequate sleep, and adequate exercise.
But there are also some things to avoid.
It is true that the spread of the disease is increasing the tension.
About this Dr. Manoj Bhatwadekar said, "A person who is cowardly positive is the physical condition of that person.
Positive people have fear, anxiety, we can infect others, it makes them feel guilty.
Mumbai: 'What to eat if there is a lockdown?' Foreign laborers waited for the village
Seeing the growing number of corona patients in Maharashtra, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, while interacting with the people on April 2, had said, "I am warning you of a complete lockdown."
According to this, there was a discussion today whether there would be lockdown in Maharashtra.
The possibility of a lockdown shocked some foreign workers in Mumbai and they decided to return to their hometowns.
This includes workers from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal.
When we reached the Lokmanya Tilak terminus in Mumbai around 2 pm, we saw hundreds of laborers.
The group was marching towards the station with bags in their hands and backs.
One of these was Khalilullah Khan.
They met us just outside the main entrance of Lokmanya Tilak Terminus.
He says he decided to return to the village as soon as he understood the lockdown.
He said, "I drive a rickshaw in Mumbai.
Besides, in the current situation, people don't go out of the house, so there's no business at all.
Sudhir Chauhan was standing on the outer wall of Lokmanya Terminus with a torn bag in his hand.
After talking to him, it was learned that he had come to Mumbai from Kolkata for labor a month and a half ago.
Now due to the increase in Corona patients and strict restrictions, their work has stopped.
After the lockdown, will you stay and eat in Mumbai?
At the same time, we saw five or six people rushing to the train station.
When he was asked why he was going to the village, Naseem replied, "Brother, I haven't had any work since last week.
Naseem and his colleagues make bags in Dharavi.
We talked to some people at the station, but there were many people who had built their world and were on their way to the village.
Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar has clarified that if the time comes to impose lockdown, we will give two days.
He was speaking after a Corona status review meeting chaired by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.
He said, "Last time the Prime Minister imposed a sudden lockdown and the workers got stuck.
'Corona will not end soon' - WHO
Steroids can be controlled for a few months by taking steps for public health.
Even though 78 million doses of the corona vaccine have been given worldwide so far, this is not a sign that the outbreak is over, he said.
In December 2019, the corona virus spread around the world from the Chinese city of Wuhan.
According to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyes, "Corona cases have been declining for six consecutive weeks in January and February.
During a conversation in Geneva, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyes said, "The vaccine is definitely an important weapon to fight the corona.
Social distance, the use of masks, frequent hand washing and a well-ventilated area are all effective against the disease.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyes said there is no similarity in the steps taken for public health.
People should stop thinking that corona is a simple flu, because the virus has killed young and healthy people, he said.
It is not yet clear whether the disease will have a far-reaching effect on those who become corona-free.
'Corona's support won't end there'
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyes, head of the World Health Organization, said: "The world has a number of reasons to keep hope alive.
Earlier this year (2021), the number of corona cases had decreased.
Given the pace at which vaccines are being produced globally, it is impossible for vaccines to reach all countries as quickly and uniformly as possible.
Corona vaccine: Blood clots after vaccination, young people under the age of 30 in Britain do not have the AstraZeneca vaccine
In Britain, young people under the age of 30 should not be vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine, but should be given an alternative vaccine, according to the MHRA, which regulates drugs.
The MHRA has made this suggestion after receiving complaints of blood clotting in some people after taking the AstraZeneca vaccine.
The MHRA studied vaccinations in the UK until the end of March.
It showed blood clots in 79 people who had been vaccinated against AstraZeneca.
However, there is no strong evidence that the AstraZeneca vaccine caused blood clots to form in these people, the MHRA said.
But, on the other hand, whether there is any connection between blood clots and vaccination is also being investigated.
Side effects of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine are extremely rare.
Notice of MHRA
According to MHRA, the vaccine will be beneficial for most people.
Also, people who have taken the first dose should take the second dose, MHRA said.
But those who have problems with blood clots should not take a second dose, the organization said.
Following the report of MHRA, the government advisory body JCVE also took steps in this regard.
The government has suggested that young people between the ages of 18 and 29 should be vaccinated with something other than AstraZeneca.

What is Corona?
Corona is nowhere.
Corona is gone.
Millions of people are participating in the West Bengal election campaign rally.
A senior leader in the state, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, "Currently we have another battle ahead.
Corona explosions have been reported across the country.
In West Bengal, the election campaign has reached its peak.
According to experts, a new record of corona infection could be set in the state after the end of the West Bengal elections.
Rules of Social Distinction
The West Bengal election campaign is in full swing.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold a meeting of state chief ministers on April 8 to discuss the second wave of corona outbreaks.
Modi-Mamata doesn't care about Corona, what are we going to do Doctor's letter to Election Commission
But, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has expressed concern over the election while drawing attention to the corona infection.
Postponing the vote in the name of corona infection will no longer be acceptable under any circumstances, he said.
Mamata Banerjee says, "Corona infection is rampant in the country.
BJP leaders say that there is a possibility of a strong push against Mamata in Bengal.
West Bengal BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu says, "Corona infection could lead to polls in Bihar, so why not in Bengal?
What are the Congress and CPM leaders saying?
Congress and CPM leaders said the situation in Corona in the state was not very serious.
CPM leader Rabin Deb says, "The corona infection situation in Bengal is not relatively serious enough to prevent elections.
Congress leader Pradeep Bhattacharya has accused Mamata Banerjee and the BJP of playing politics on the issue of Corona.
Modi-Mamata doesn't care about Corona, what are we going to do Doctor's letter to Election Commission
The Joint Forum of Doctors West Bengal, an association of doctors in Bengal, has sent a letter to the Election Commission.
All political parties in Bengal are seen violating the Corona Protocol drawn up by the Election Commission before the Bihar elections.
The doctor writes in his letter, "Have you ever seen Home Minister Amit Shah wearing a mask.
What is going on during the election process?

Corona vaccine: Oxford - 7 die of blood clots in UK after taking AstraZeneca vaccine
In the UK, seven people have died of blood clots after being vaccinated against Oxford-AstraZeneca.
As many as 1.8 million people in the UK have been vaccinated since March 24, with 30 of them diagnosed with blood clots.
But the UK's drug regulators say the benefits of the vaccine are many times greater than the risks of the vaccine.
A spokesman for AstraZeneca said "the safety of patients is a top priority for the company."
But since then, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Canada have limited the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine to senior citizens.
According to figures released by the UK's drug regulator on Friday, there have been 22 cases of blood clots, such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST).
At the same time, the platelets in the blood of these people had decreased.
Seven people have died in the UK, the UK's drug regulator has told the BBC via email.
The chief executive of the UK drug regulator MHRA, Dr. "The benefits of vaccines to prevent Covid 19 infections and the complications of vaccines are many times greater than the risks, and people should continue to get vaccinated when they have their turn," said Rein.
Did the AstraZeneca vaccine cause blood clots?
These types of rare blood clots are caused by the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is currently being investigated.
But two of these factors have raised doubts.
The vaccine may be one of the causes of these rare and isolated cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, but it is not yet clear.
The difference between Oxford - AstraZeneca and Pfizer - Bioentech vaccines, is another different issue.
There have been two cases of CVST after Pfizer vaccination in the UK.
Also, it is not clear how many people with ERV have blood clots in this way.
In Germany, 2.7 million people were vaccinated.
No data has been released on how many people in the UK have been affected.
A researcher told the BBC that there was growing evidence that the blood clots were linked to the vaccine.
Medical Microbiologist from East Anglia University Pvt.
But such incidents are rare, says Edinburgh University Public Health Expert Pvt.
Analysis by James Gallagher
All medicines, be they vaccines or paracetamol, are likely to have some side effects.
Guillain-Barre syndrome is also one in ten million people likely to be affected by the flu vaccine.
The question then becomes - is it really worth the risk?
It has not yet been proven that these problems are caused by vaccines.
But it is important to look at the dangers posed by the corona virus.
If 2.5 million people over the age of 60 became infected with the corona virus, about 50,000 lives would be lost.
The benefits and risks of the vaccine will continue to be studied as the vaccine for Covid 19 reaches a younger age.
Corona Vaccine: How to register for vaccination by downloading the Co-WIN app?
From April 1, all people over the age of 45 in the country will be vaccinated against covid.
Vaccination for Covid 19 was started in India from January 16 and from March 1, citizens above 60 years of age and citizens above 45 years of age with congenital heart disease were being vaccinated.
In the first phase, healthcare workers and frontline workers were vaccinated.
A digital platform called Co-Win has been developed for this vaccination campaign.
What is the Co-WIN app?
The Government of India has stated that the primary objective of this app is to help the system to monitor the vaccination program of Covid 19.
Coin (Co-WIN) is a digital platform for the Covid 19 vaccination campaign.
But there is some confusion over the name of this Co-WIN app.
How to download Coin (Co-WIN) app?
The Covin (Co-WIN) app is available for download in the App Store.
Who can register on the Covin (Co-WIN) app?
In the early stages of vaccination, the app could only be used by government officials and the health system.
For this, first you have to go to the website https://www.cowin.gov.in/home and register your mobile number.
After that you can register a total of 4 people on this one login.
When registering a person, his name, date of birth and Aadhar number or other identity card will have to be filled.
You can then book a vaccination slot.
You will need to have photo ID to register.
These documents can be used
Voter ID card
Aadhaar card
Driving license
PAN card
MGNREGA employment card
Bank or post office passbook
Passbook
Pension documents
The same identity card used during registration will have to be shown while going for vaccination.
How to book a slot for vaccination?
Login using the mobile number you registered on the portal.
You want to make an appointment by clicking on the calendar icon in front of these names.
After clicking on this mark you want to select the state.
This will include both government and private centers.
Where you have to pay for the vaccine, it will be written as Paid.
You can check which date slots are available by clicking on each of these centers.
When you go to get vaccinated on the day of this appointment, do not forget to bring along the identity card on which you have registered.
After taking the first dose of vaccine, you will get an sms telling you when to come and take the second dose.
How will the Coin (Co-WIN) app work?
This is a cloud based app designed for planning, implementation and monitoring of the vaccination campaign for Covid 19.
After registering for the vaccine through this app, the registrant will be provided the date, time and details of the vaccination center via SMS.
Since each person will have to take two doses of the vaccine, the app will also tell you when you want to come back after the first dose and take the second dose.
After taking both doses of the vaccine, the person will be given a certificate in the form of a QR code.
What are the five modules on the Covin app and what are they for?
The Covin (Co-WIN) app will have five modules - Management, Registration, Vaccination, Acknowledgment and Information.
People can register for vaccination through the registration module.
It will be an 'Administrator' module for vaccinating officers.
The information provided by the registrant can be verified by the vaccination module in the app and the status of the person can also be updated after vaccination.
QR code certificates will be generated through the 'Beneficiary Acknowledgment Module' for acknowledgment and an SMS will be sent to the person after vaccination.
With the help of 'Report' module, information on vaccination sessions - how many sessions were given, how many people were vaccinated and who did not come - can be reported to the authorities.
Corona vaccine: Covohax vaccine trials begin in India - Other Poonawala
Adar Poonawala, head of the Serum Institute, said testing of the covavax vaccine on corona has begun in India.
Covovax vaccine is being developed by NovaVax and Serum Institute.
The Serum Institute of India is producing Kovavax in a joint venture with Novavax.
The vaccine has been developed by US-based biotech company Novavax.
The company had released the information in January.
The vaccine is currently being tested in India and is expected to be available for vaccination by September, said Poonawala.
Covishield vaccine is currently being supplied to underdeveloped countries under the World Health Organization's Covax campaign.
What is genome sequencing?
The corona virus found in Britain has mutated.
The new virus is spreading at a rate of 70 per cent faster, according to the British government.
Genome sequencing is the process of identifying whether the genetic makeup of a virus has changed.
Positive passengers to have 'genome sequencing'
In the last few days, the Indian government has decided to 'genome sequencing' passengers returning from the UK.
While giving information about this, the member of the policy commission Dr. V. K. Paul said, "The study of samples that came for genome sequencing in experimental schools across the country has been started on the battlefield."
Passengers returning from the UK have been contacted in the last few days.
But how do researchers recognize that the virus has mutated?
What is genome sequencing?
Simply put, 'Every virus has a different genetic makeup.
The virus has its own DNA or RNA code.
Talking about this, pathologist Dr. Prasad Kulkarni says, "The virus has a specific genetic code.
Both old and new viruses are matched to find out if there is a change in the genetic makeup of the virus.
What are the benefits of genome sequencing?
Speaking to the BBC about genome sequencing, the Director General of the Central Government's Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Dr. Shekhar Mande says, "Whether the virus has mutated or not.
According to experts, there are four major benefits of genome sequencing.
1- How the virus is spreading.
2- Helps to find out if the vaccine available on the virus is effective
3- Can a new virus 'strain' infect a person?
4- It is useful to identify new viruses
We can do genome sequencing of passengers from the UK and corona positive.
Need Genome Surveillance?
Genome sequencing will be extended to India after the discovery of a new corona strain in the UK.
Speaking about 'genome' surveillance, Dr. "Genome surveillance is very much needed.
So, the member of the policy commission, Dr. Paul says, "The mutation in this strain is about the place where the virus enters the body's cells.
Current status of genome sequencing in India
In India, genome sequencing is done in two laboratories of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.
A large number of genome sequencing has been done at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) in Delhi.
The Director of IGIB, Dr. Anurag Agarwal told the BBC: "India has so far genome sequencing of 4,000 samples related to Covid-19.
Genome sequencing will help determine if there are new mutations in the virus.
Who will do the genome sequencing?
If this new virus is not found in India.
1- A certain percentage of corona positive patients
2- 100 percent positive passengers coming from abroad
3- Individuals re-infected after corona healing
4- Participants in the vaccine testing process
Genome sequencing should be done, says Dr. Agarwal has expressed.
Speaking on the situation in India, a member of the Policy Commission, Dr. V. K. "We are studying the structure of the virus in laboratories.
According to experts, genome sequencing takes 24-48 hours to run.
Samples are taken from the patient's nose.
What effect does the new virus 'strain' have on the vaccine?
A new strain of the corona virus is spreading rapidly, according to the British government.
Speaking on the occasion, Director General of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Dr. Shekhar Mande says, "This new strain will have no effect on the vaccine.
Is the new virus 'Superspader' in Britain?
Member of the Policy Commission Dr. According to Paul, "changes in the virus have increased the risk of infection.
Corona Lockdown: Did Narendra Modi discuss with anyone during the lockdown? - BBC Special Report
The BBC's exclusive review of what exactly happened on the occasion of the year-long announcement of the lockdown imposed on India by the Corona:
Seema Kumari has a small hotel in Simdega district of Jharkhand.
A sudden nationwide lockdown in the country changed his life.
Speaking to us, she said, "It's better to die than to live like this again.
Seema was not given any protective gear while working as a frontline health worker.
Reminiscing about the train journey, Seema says, "The government was prepared by an employee.
Background
Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown on March 24, 2020.
As many as 30 states and union territories, according to government data.
When Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the lockdown
The question here is whether there was a need for nationwide lockdown if different state governments had already implemented lockdown in their respective states.
In support of the nationwide lockdown imposed on March 24, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) had said, "There needs to be consistency in the implementation of various measures implemented across the country."
The Prime Minister himself is the chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
This means that the central government took responsibility by implementing a nationwide lockdown.
To find out the answer to this question, we contacted key organizations, government departments and state governments that were directly affected by the lockdown under the Right to Information Act, 2005.
However, a close investigation by the BBC revealed very little evidence.
On March 1, 2021, we approached the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to present the government's position on this issue.
Let us now learn about the key departments of the Central Government, especially the Ministries of Public Health and Economy.
On-record acknowledges that most of these departments did not have enough information or were contacted before the nationwide lockdown took effect.
So the important question is how the central government decided what Oxford University's 'Covid-19 Government Response Tracker' called the world's toughest lockdown.
This is because if the government agencies responsible for the factors that would have been affected by the severe lockdown are not aware of it, how will they help the citizens?
Health sector
Soon after the corona virus began to spread in Wuhan, on January 8, 2020, India began to take precautions.
In fact, during the two-and-a-half months between January 8 and March 24, the Prime Minister was told that "caste is paying attention to this issue".
The Prime Minister had said, "Prepare, but do not be afraid."
Then in February, preparations were underway for the visit of the then US President Donald Trump to India.
Despite assurances from the Prime Minister and the Health Minister, the number of corona victims in India continued to rise .
Then on March 5, 2020, the Health Minister told Parliament that " India has adequate stocks of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and N95 masks and adequate isolation beds in case of outbreak of the disease ".
On March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Covid-19 a global epidemic.
Love Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, had said, Are planned. "
And in spite of all this, when the number of corona victims in India was only 600 and 9 people died, the Center imposed a severe lockdown in just 12 days.
We asked the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare what role you played in planning this nationwide lockdown.
After this we contacted various important departments and institutions of the same ministry.
We first contacted the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS).
The BBC correspondent asked for information under the Right to Information Act
No issues related to the lockdown, which will take effect on March 24, 2020, were discussed with the organization.
Answers to questions asked by the BBC
The next center under the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is the National Center for Disease Control (NCDC).
The Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), an organization under the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, has been at the forefront of the fight against covid-19 since early last year.
RTI application
The organization was at the forefront of testing, developing protocols, studying viruses, and participating in vaccines.
At a time when corona infection was spreading in India, the head of ICMR's infectious diseases department, Dr. R. R. Gangakhedkar had told me, "It would be wrong to say that the lockdown was implemented without consulting anyone or giving anyone an idea.
We wrote to ICMR about this.
RTI application
There are few hospitals in India with excellent health facilities like the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi, which comes under the purview of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
Even Indian Army doctors have been trying to contain this global epidemic from the very beginning.
RTI application process
He did not have any documents to show that he had discussed the matter with them before the lockdown.
Asked when AFMS was informed of the lockdown decision, he said, "The Prime Minister announced it through the media."
'Health administration in the dark'
Within a few days of the lockdown, there was an atmosphere of confusion and confusion.
Sameed Ahmed Farooqi works as a project manager in Delhi.
Information application
Farooqi said, "Most of the government helplines were closed at that time.
Fortunately, Farooqi's parents both returned home after treatment.
Economy
In his address to the nation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said, "There is no doubt that the country will have to pay the financial price of the lockdown.
The final stage of the RTI process
So, what was the 'price' of this lockdown?
So the price was too high.
The lockdown has led to a sharp rise in unemployment.
The lockdown has cost many jobs.
In February 2021, it was 6.9 percent.
However, there is no reason to rejoice, even if the unemployment rate is as high as it was before the lockdown, as it does not indicate a reduction in the number of unemployed.
One of these important criteria is India's employment rate.
Answer given by RBI under RTI
We also approached the Union Ministry of Finance through various departments such as Economic Affairs, Expenditure, Revenue, Financial Services.
Many applications initially made under RTI were forwarded by the Finance Ministry to the Home Ministry.
Finally, the Home Ministry had to clarify that this information has been requested from your departments.
This was followed by a reply from all these departments.
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council is a 'constitutional body'.
In view of the impact of the virus on the economy, the Prime Minister announced the setting up of a 'Covid-19 Economic Response Task Force' headed by the Finance Minister.
The task of this task force was to effectively implement all the measures taken to alleviate the financial difficulties.
No information has yet been provided by the Prime Minister's Office and the Finance Ministry despite an application under the Right to Information Act 2005.
We also approached the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the regulator of banks in India.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the capital market regulator, said, "SEBI has not been contacted regarding the implementation of the nationwide lockdown."
Similar responses were received from key ministries and departments like Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), Ministry of Telecommunications, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Civil Aviation, Consumer Affairs.
According to policy analyst Priya Rajan Dash, 'India's economy has already slowed down.
After telling them the information we got, she said, "That's the way this government works."
Better planning could have been done.
Human cost
The most grim picture of the lockdown is the migrant workers returning to their homes in any case.
On 14 September 2020, the Union Ministry of Labor and Employment was asked to provide information in this regard.
Responding to this, the ministry said that more than 1 crore migrant workers have returned to their homes.
Migrant workers returning by road
The ministry also said that no statistics were available on how many workers died on the way home and how many migrant workers lost their jobs.
On the same day that the lockdown was announced, the Ministry of Labor and Employment ‘advised’ all States and Union Territories to use the funds sent for direct bank transfers for construction approvals.
What else did the ministry do?
In this regard, we contacted 45 different departments from the Chief Secretariat of the Ministry and sought information under RTI.
Preeti Singh is a volunteer with the Stranded Workers Action Network (SWAN).
She says, "Even if it's an exam, you prepare.
It was like an experiment in which we were all guinea pigs.
What do others have to say?
The BBC also contacted the offices of the president and vice president.
The reply sent by the President's Secretariat said, "No information is available in the relevant department of this Secretariat."
According to the Vice President's Office, the lockdown was announced through an order issued by the Union Home Ministry on March 24, 2020.
The reply from the Vice President's Office said, "The Secretariat has not contacted the Prime Minister's Office in this regard."
In 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the creation of the post of Chief of Defense Staff (CDS).
Coincidentally, the current CDS General Bipin Rawat held a press conference on May 1, 2020 and praised the performance of the Corona Warriors and announced that he would continue to support the Frontline Warriors.
We also asked their department if they had been informed about the lockdown and if anything related to it had been discussed.
In response, we were told, "No information available."
The Ministry of Manpower Development also said, "Whether the Prime Minister's Office consulted with the Department of Higher Education before announcing the lockdown and information on other related issues is not on record."
Corona: Lockdown of important ministries due to Narendra Modi's lockdown decision?
There is going to be a complete lockdown all over the country
Do you remember these words?
To stop the spread of this global epidemic and break the chain of transmission, on March 24, 2020, at 8 pm, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stopped working in India.
There were 519 patients of Covid-19 in the country that day and 9 died along with it.
Our government is working with the state governments and on the advice of experts, he said.
In fact, for more than two and a half months now - since the Government of India began monitoring the virus and preparing for a solution, the image has been that we are working together.
However, a thorough investigation by the BBC did not find much evidence that the consultation actually took place despite the drastic step of imposing a national lockdown.
We investigated this using the Right to Information Act, 2005, i.e. the Right to Information Act (RTI).
We contacted the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on March 1, 2021 to understand the government's position in this regard.
The majority responded that they had not been consulted before the implementation of the largest lockdown in the world, nor did they know that they would have a role in it.
So how did India take this decision and how was the government expected to help the citizens?
Let us first learn some references.
Announcement of lockdown in the country
The lockdown was announced on March 24, 2020, two months before that, in mid-January, when we were actively monitoring the spread of the corona virus and preparing a response, the Indian government said.
As India was preparing for the grand reception of the then US President Donald Trump, on 22 February 20202, the country’s Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan further announced: "
As the number of patients gradually increased, Harsh Vardhan assured Parliament on March 5, 2020, " Stocks of personal protective equipment and N-95 masks and protective items are also with the states and the central government .
Yet within three weeks a strict national lockdown was imposed.
The central government backed its action on March 24 by pointing out that " more than thirty states and union territories had imposed a complete embargo " even before the prime minister's announcement .
A night in Kolkata during a lockdown
The central government did not say whether most of the states had announced the lockdown considering their local conditions and readiness.
Globally ...
When India imposed the lockdown, some European nations had already imposed sanctions, while in many places there were lockdowns.
These included Italy (according to the World Health Organization, Italy had 60,000 patients at the time, with about 6,000 deaths), Spain (about 50,000 patients and 3,000 deaths) and France (about 20,000 patients and about 700 deaths). .
But with more than 80,000 patients and 3,000 deaths, China imposed a lockdown in Hubei province alone.
How did the Indian government take this decision?
Prime Minister Modi's speech on March 24 was part of a public outcry over the lockdown announcement.
Lockout order
It is important to note that the Prime Minister is the chairman of this authority.
The order issued by the National Disaster Management Authority's 'Policy and Planning Department' to the Union Home Ministry on March 24, 2020, said, "Continuity is needed in the implementation of various measures across the country.
The Union Home Secretary, who chairs the National Executive Committee of the Disaster Management Authority, issued the guidelines on March 24.
We also contacted the National Disaster Management Authority.
We applied to the authority under the Right to Information Act.
We also inquired about the number of meetings of the National Disaster Management Authority on Corona Partnership held before 24 March 2020 in the presence of the Prime Minister.
Responding to our application, the authority said that no such consultation process had taken place, and no meeting on the issue had been held in the presence of the Prime Minister.
Disaster management response
What did the Prime Minister's Office say?
Attempts have been made to paint a picture of the Prime Minister personally taking the lead in national measures since the outbreak of the corona virus.
So we asked the Prime Minister's Office for a list of how many meetings related to the corona virus were held in the presence of the Prime Minister.
We also asked for a list of which ministers, chief ministers and advisers were consulted before the announcement of the national lockdown.
Answer from the Prime Minister's Office
The Prime Minister's Office did not provide the information, despite repeated inquiries.
While rejecting an application, it was described as 'rough' and 'suspicious'.
While refusing to respond to the second application, the Prime Minister's Office relied on Section 7 (9) of the Right to Information Act.
According to Anjali Bharadwaj, who works for transparency and accountability in governance, the provision will not exempt the government from the rules.
The Prime Minister had interacted with the Chief Minister on March 20, 2020, four days before the announcement of the lockdown.
In this context , the word 'lockout' is not mentioned anywhere in the press release issued by the Prime Minister's Office .
So we asked for information on whether the issue of national lockout was discussed.
The application was forwarded by the Prime Minister's Office to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and then to the Ministry of Home Affairs.
Leaflet sent by the Prime Minister's Office
Now let's talk about the Ministry of Home Affairs
The role of the Home Ministry in these developments is particularly important for two reasons.
One, the guidelines on lockdown were published under the authority of the Ministry of Home Affairs.
Two, the important departments and ministries with which we contacted regarding the lockdown decisions and many of them transferred our applications to the Ministry of Home Affairs.
Home Ministry response
Our request for information on what consultations the Home Ministry held before the lockdown was announced was rejected.
Because what
According to the Ministry, the issues in our application are "of strategic and economic interest and some of the information contained in the trust is disconnected from disclosure under Section 8 (1) (a) and (u) of the Right to Information Act, 2005. Has arrived. "
Home Ministry response
Similar responses were received in many RTI applications.
Home Ministry response
Did the states know this?
Before the central government imposed the lockdown, the offices of the lieutenant governor, chief minister and chief secretary in the capital Delhi had no information about the consultation.
Similarly, the Chief Ministers' Offices in Assam and Telangana said that they did not have any information suggesting that consultations were held before the announcement.
The secretariats of the governors of Punjab, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh said that they did not have any such information.
Response from Uttar Pradesh Governor's Secretariat
In particular, the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister's Office sent back our question and asked the Government of India to inquire into the matter.
The Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region at the Center was working with the states in the region to address the issue.
North Eastern Ministry of Development
What happened to the Corona virus group of ministers and when was the lockdown discussed in the cabinet ?
The government announced on February 3, 2020 that a high-level group of ministers had been set up by the Prime Minister to review how the corona virus is treated.
The group of ministers is headed by Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan had and the ministers of civil aviation, foreign affairs, shipping, home, etc. were in this group.
The group held several meetings between February 3 and the implementation of the lockout.
We contacted the Cabinet Secretariat to find out if the group of ministers had recommended a lockdown, or if there had been any discussion with the group.
Why did we ask this to the Cabinet Secretariat?
This is because "the Secretariat provides secretarial assistance to the Cabinet and Cabinet Committees, as well as assists the Government in the decision-making process by proposing inter-ministerial coordination .
However, the Secretariat also sent our application to the Home Ministry.
A few days later, the Cabinet responded by saying, "The information you have sought is excluded from disclosure under sections 8 (1), (a) and (u) of the Right to Information Act, 2005."
The same information application was also sent to the Ministry of Health.
According to information received from the Cabinet Secretariat, the Union Cabinet meeting was held in the days before the lockout.
Answer of Central Secretariat
' We knew the lockdown was coming'
Although the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting did not respond, we asked the Deputy Chairman of the Policy Commission, Dr. Rajiv Kumar was asked about the lockdown.
'Anti-democratic attitude'
Reviewing the response to our information requests from the National Disaster Management Authority and the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, Anjali said, "Disaster management rights are wide-ranging.
Commenting on the manner in which the RTI application was rejected, Anjali said, "These responses are not acceptable.
Anjali said that the states had not given them prior notice of the lockdown, adding that "this does not lead to accountability.
Corona vaccine: Can manufacturers meet the global demand for vaccines?
The scene when the AstraZeneca vaccine produced in India reached Bangladesh.
India, one of the world's largest producers of corona virus vaccines, is finding it difficult to meet global demand for the vaccine.
Orders for doses to be sent to the UK are likely to take some time to complete, and large orders for Nepal have also been put on hold, according to the largest vaccine manufacturer.
Is there a shortage of doses?
The Serum Institute of India in Pune, India produces Novavax and AstraZeneca vaccines.
Adar Poonawala, CEO of the Serum Institute, said the shortage was due to the US export ban on certain vaccine-making bags and filters.
The company also said it was having difficulty importing disposable tubes, cell culture media and certain chemicals.
It takes certain ingredients to make a vaccine.
The distribution of these raw materials is going to be a big issue.
The Serum Institute has written a letter to the Government of India urging it to intervene and resolve the issue so as to ensure smooth production and supply of vaccines worldwide.
There is another Indian pharmaceutical company - Biological E. The company produces Johnson & Johnson vaccines.
In the past, American suppliers have been reluctant to guarantee that their delivery date will be met, says Mahima Dat, the company's chief executive.
Why did the US take a stand?
US President Joe Biden has suggested that the administration should consider whether there could be a future shortage of ingredients for vaccine production.
Biden enacted the Defense Production Act (DPA).
Accordingly, the President may impose restrictions on the export of goods required for domestic production.
The Biden administration said the law would be used to prioritize the supply of special pumps and filtration units to vaccine manufacturers in the United States.
This was followed by objections from vaccine manufacturers around the world in early March.
Vaccine manufacturers have said that export restrictions on supplies from some major suppliers will affect vaccine production worldwide.
Some of the items that need to be of standard quality can take up to 12 months to get from others, the manufacturers said.
Dr. Sarah Schiffling is an expert on the Vaccine Supply Chain at John Moore University in Liverpool.
She says the supply chain in the pharmaceutical sector is complex.
The sudden shortage of demand from around the world is inevitable, she added.
Effects on vaccine production in India
There are currently 2 vaccines allowed in India.
Since January, 130 million doses of Kovishield manufactured by the Serum Institute have been used or exported in the country.
Vaccine storage center in Bangalore
Indian vaccine companies have increased production by setting up new manufacturing plants to meet domestic and global demand or by converting separate manufacturing units into covid vaccine manufacturing units for a few months.
The Serum Institute had said in January that we can now produce 6 to 7 crore doses of vaccine per month.
The Serum Institute had earlier told the BBC that its goal was to increase production to 100 million doses per month by March.
Is the demand in India being met?
The vaccination campaign in India was launched on January 16.
In some parts of the country, the number of Kovid patients has increased.
So far, the Serum Institute has agreed to provide 100 million doses to the Government of India.
India has also signed an agreement with Russia's Gamaleya Research Institute to produce 200 million doses of their Sputnik vaccine.
Indian manufacturers will also manufacture the vaccine for the Indian market and for export.
In January, Adar Poonawala, head of the Siram Institute, had suggested that the vaccine was allowed on the condition that the Siram Institute would prioritize India's domestic needs.
However, the Indian government later clarified that there were no restrictions on lashi exports after Bangladesh inquired whether the agreement reached with it for Kovishield would be fulfilled.
Who will get the vaccine in India?
The Serum Institute of India supports the Covax group of the United Nations.
Serum had agreed in September 2020 to give Kovax 200 million doses of AstraZeneca or Novavax vaccine.
Corona test
In addition, Serum has signed a bilateral trade agreement to supply 90 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine and 14.5 million doses of Novavax, according to United Nations figures.
The Government of India has also donated vaccines to many countries, especially to South Asian trading countries.
So far, the Indian government has donated more vaccines worldwide than China.
Ramdev Baba's 'Coronil' not recognized as Covid-19 drug - Assistant Drugs Controller
Assistant Drug Controller Sushant Sarkar clarified that Ramdev Baba's 'Coronil' was not approved as a treatment against Covid-19.
The information was given in response to a petition filed by an information officer filed by the Indian Medical Association.
Dr. of the Indian Medical Association.
Letter from the Assistant Drugs Controller
Coronil made by Ramdev Baba's Ayurvedic manufacturer Patanjali has been banned in Maharashtra.
What's so significant about a coronal?
Patanjali had claimed that the drug coronil was effective against the corona virus.
Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh had tweeted about this.
In his tweet, Anil Deshmukh said, "The IMA has questioned the alleged medical tests of Coronil.
Home Minister Deshmukh had said that uncertified coronil from WHO, IMA and other organizations could not be sold in Maharashtra.
The controversy erupted after Patanjali claimed that coronil was effective against covid-19 and that it was approved by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The World Health Organization (WHO) immediately rejected the claims of Baba Ramdev and Patanjali.
The controversy was sparked by the presence of Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan at the Coronil launch.
On the other hand, the presence of the Union Health Minister at the launch of 'Coronil' angered private doctors across the country.
WHO rejects claim
Patanjali's claim was later rejected by the WHO.
The World Health Organization has not tested or approved any conventional anti-corona drug.
Acharya Balakrishna, Executive Director, Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd., later tweeted that the 'Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product' given to Coronil was not issued by WHO but by DCGI.
Corona virus: 25,833 new corona patients a day in Maharashtra, why are the numbers increasing despite vaccination?
The state on Thursday (March 18) found 25,833 new patients infected with corona.
On Thursday, the state surpassed the highest number of daily corona patients ever.
As a result, the number of patients infected with corona virus in Maharashtra so far has reached 23 lakh 29 thousand 464.
The second wave of corona has started in Maharashtra.
The total number of new patients in India in the 24 hours from March 17 to 18 was 35,871.
The ongoing vaccination campaign for Covid 19 in India is the largest vaccination campaign in the world.
So why is the number of Kovid-19 patients increasing in Maharashtra even though vaccination is on?
Is there adequate supply of vaccine in the state?
Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope wrote a letter to the Center on March 16 demanding more doses for the state.
The Union Health Minister has demanded that 2 crore 20 lakh doses be made available for vaccination of about 1 crore 77 lakh people in the priority group.
Maharashtra has demanded immediate supply of adequate vaccines to control the growing number of corona cases in the state, but Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar has claimed that Maharashtra has adequate stocks of the vaccine.
He tweeted about the role of the central government.
"The central government had given 54 lakh vaccines to Maharashtra till March 12.
So there is another issue with the supply of vaccines.
On March 16, all the state chief ministers held a meeting with Prime Minister Modi via video conferencing.
Why is the number of patients increasing despite vaccination?
At the dawn of 2021, there were 5,000 to 7,000 cases in the country.
But where did your vaccination campaign come from when Corona was trying to get her head back on its head?
Vaccination statistics
As many as 35 lakh 73 thousand 489 vaccines have been administered in the state till March 14 and two doses of 7 per cent people have been completed.
Number of patients
Speaking to BBC Marathi about the increase in the number of patients, Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope said, "It is a surprise to us that there is no real reason for such an increase.
On the other hand, the member of the policy commission, Dr. VK Paul has expressed concern over the situation in Maharashtra at a weekly press conference held last week.
Corona vaccination: Misconceptions about vaccines, which are true, which are false?
The second phase of the vaccination campaign for Covid 19 is underway in India.
After vaccinating health workers and frontline workers in the first phase, now in the second phase, citizens above 50 years of age and those under the age of 50 with sympathizers are vaccinated.
But people have some doubts about this vaccine.
For example, the corona vaccine causes impotence in a man or a woman, or the face becomes paralyzed with gas.
Corona vaccination and misconceptions
Corona vaccination campaigns have been launched in many countries around the world.
Corona drug
For the first phase of vaccination, the central government has procured 10 million doses of covshield vaccine and 55 lakh doses of covacin.
Does the corona vaccine cause impotence?
There is a widespread belief that the corona vaccine causes impotence in both men and women, not only in India but all over the world.
There is no scientific evidence that the Covid 19 vaccine causes impotence in either men or women.
No such cases have been reported in worldwide trials of the Covishield vaccine.
Does corona vaccine cause covid 19?
Another question was constantly asked to Harshvardhan during Facebook Live.
Replying to this, the Health Minister said, "You will not get Covid 19 when you are vaccinated with Covid.
Both Covishield and Covacin vaccines were developed by extracting spike proteins from the dead corona virus.
Will these vaccines protect against the new corona?
As the year 2020 drew to a close, an outbreak of the altered corona virus began in the UK and South Africa.
No research has shown that existing vaccines cannot protect against the new corona virus found in the UK and South Africa.
Will only senior citizens and children be vaccinated?
In the first phase, 30 crore people including senior citizens and health workers were vaccinated.
On this Dr. Harshvardhan says, "In setting the priorities, the government has decided to vaccinate health workers, emergency services, cleaners, people over 50 years of age and those with a serious illness first.
Care to be taken at the time of vaccination
In addition, the Ministry of Health has issued a statement on what to look out for when vaccinating, who should be vaccinated and who should not.
Only people over the age of 18 will be vaccinated.
Two vaccines have been approved by the central government.
If a person has a reaction to the vaccine after taking the first dose, that is, if they have some adverse effects of the vaccine, such a person should not be given a second dose.
Such a woman should not be vaccinated if she is pregnant or breastfeeding.
Those who currently have covid-19 and are undergoing treatment should not be vaccinated.
There is a lot of information on corona vaccination.
Narendra Modi's advice to states:
Corona infection is on the rise again across the country, including Maharashtra.
The Prime Minister advised that covid testing should be increased across the country and strict preventive measures should be taken.
During the meeting, the Prime Minister also made some important suggestions to the Chief Minister.
1. Even medicine and strictness
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, "We must abide by this mantra and the people should abide by it.
2. Need to increase RTPSR tests
Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid special emphasis on increasing RTPCR tests across the country.
3. Micro containment zone
The Prime Minister also stressed that micro-containment zones should be set up in every city and the local administration should insist on it.
4. Increase the number of vaccination centers
The Prime Minister said, "There is a need to increase the number of vaccination centers, be it private or government.
He further said, "Technology is helping us a lot.
5. Prevent vaccine waste
The Covid-19 vaccine is needed all over the world today.
6. Expiry date of vaccine
The Prime Minister said, "We also need to pay attention to the expiry date of the vaccine.
7. Strict implementation of basic measures
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that new and stringent measures need to be taken to curb the growing contagion of the corona virus.
Minister Yashomati Thakur inspecting the situation
Elaborating on this, the Prime Minister said, "There is a need to re-emphasize the use of masks, keeping a distance from the body, maintaining cleanliness.
'Fear of nationwide outbreak'
The fight against the Corona is now coming to an end.
Speaking to the Chief Minister, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, "More than 96 per cent patients have been cured in India.
He further said, "It can be seen that the test positivity rate is very high in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh and the number is also increasing.
The Prime Minister said that in many places the local administration was not taking the issue of masks and physical distance very seriously.
He said, "This is a test of good governance.
'Need to focus on small towns'
The Prime Minister said, "One thing we need to pay close attention to is that this time our Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, which were not initially affected, have a growing number of cases in their vicinity.
Danger of the Corona variant
Some new types of corona have been found in some countries.
It is necessary to find out whether the corona virus has made any changes in India itself.
This will let you know if there is a new variant of the corona virus in your state, he said.
'Vaccine waste should be stopped immediately'
Today we have the vaccine on corona.
He said, "After a year of fighting against corona, we have a vaccine in our hands.
Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are wasting more than 10 per cent of the dose.
He said that if there are any problems in planning and governance at the local level, vaccines should be eliminated immediately.
Prime Minister Modi says, I think states should work towards the goal of 'Zero Vaccine Waste'.
Prime Minister's instructions
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that his administration has received good training over the last year on how to work while fighting the corona virus, adding that the administration now needs to be proactive.
He said there was a need for seriousness in terms of tests, tracks and treats.
Prime Minister Modi said, "Rapid antigen testing is being emphasized in some states.
He said the infection was on the rise as the entire country was open for travel.
He also said that SOP for foreign travelers should be strictly followed.
The Prime Minister also thanked the Corona Warriors, the state governments, the administration and the people for their contribution to India's success in the fight against the Corona.
Do not stop Covid 19 vaccination, WHO appeals to European countries
Some European countries have banned the use of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine.
France, Italy and Germany have banned the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine due to an increase in blood clotting.
However, the World Health Organization says there is no evidence that vaccines are the cause of blood clots.
Many small European countries, including Germany, France, Italy and Spain, have stopped vaccinations as a precaution and are being investigated.
The World Health Organization's security experts are meeting on Tuesday.
Vaccines are being reviewed around the world, but the World Health Organization says it is important that vaccinations continue.
WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeyer said: "The WHO is fully aware of this, has done a thorough study and if there is a need to make any changes to the current instructions, it will be communicated immediately.
A total of 17 million people in the European Union and the UK have been vaccinated.
The use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is being stopped immediately, the German health ministry said.
French President Emmanuel Macron has said that the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine will be suspended until the European Medicines Agency gives new advice on the vaccine.
The Italian Drug Enforcement Administration has announced a ban on the use of vaccines.
The Republic of Congo and Indonesia have postponed vaccination campaigns.
The World Health Organization says there is no evidence that the blood clot was caused by the vaccine.
The European Medical Association also studies the types of blood clots.
Boat quarantine has started here for tourists!
Tourists visiting Thailand can now be quarantined on a yacht.
Tourists visiting Thailand can now spend their two weeks on a mandatory quarantine boat.
The Thai government has launched this new initiative.
The country's tourism business has been hit hard by the Corona virus.
Earlier in January, the government had allowed tourists to spend their segregation on a golf course.
This South Asian country is heavily dependent on tourism for income.
The 'Quarantine on the Boat' initiative was announced on Monday, March 8.
During the Corona virus, the number of tourists visiting the area dropped from 40,000-50,000 to hundreds.
Color training
Boat applications are being accepted for participation.
The yacht quarantine scheme has been announced by the Thai government's Digital Economy Promotion Agency.
The yacht quarantine scheme has been announced by the Thai government's Digital Economy Promotion Agency.
Tourists participating will have to wear a small wristband.
The device can also transmit information from the sea in a 10-kilometer strip, the Thai government said.
Thailand banned tourists from entering the country in March last year.
Last month, Thailand's tourism minister announced plans to provide tourists with a quarantine option as well as popular beach resorts.
Quarantine at resorts or hotels is expected to begin in April or May in popular locations such as Phuket, Krabi and Chiang Mai.
Corona Vaccine: In some countries, will the corona never be vaccinated?
Global vaccination
Vaccination for Covid 19 has started in many countries of the world.
Because giving the vaccine for Covid 19 to the whole world is a matter of life and death.
Only a handful of countries have specific targets for vaccination, but the picture is not so clear elsewhere in the world.
This process of vaccination is complicated.
When will I get the vaccine?
The first phase of vaccination started from January 16 in India.
In addition to government vaccination centers, some private hospitals are also allowed to vaccinate.
Serum Institute's Covishield vaccine and Bharat Biotech - ICMR's Covacin vaccine are currently being administered in India.
Take a look at how the vaccination campaign for Covid 19 is underway around the world.
Corona virus
How many vaccines have been given so far?
More than 30 million doses of the various vaccines for Covid 19 have been administered in over 100 countries worldwide.
It is true that vaccinations began less than a year after the coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China, but there are disparities in vaccination campaigns around the world.
Some countries have acquired vaccine doses for the majority of their population and are beginning to reach them.
Most countries give priority to these citizens in the first phase of their vaccination:
Over 60 years of age
Health worker
People at high risk of covid
The effects of the vaccine are beginning to show in countries like Israel and the UK.
Although vaccination campaigns have been launched in almost all of Europe and the United States, only a handful of countries in Africa have been vaccinated.
Agathe Demrais, director of the Global Forecasting Unit at The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), has done extensive research.
The total production capacity of the vaccine in the world, the health system required to reach the vaccine population, the total population of that country and how much vaccine this country can afford were studied.
The findings of this research are somewhat expected in terms of the difference between rich and poor.
Canada and some of the richest countries in Europe follow.
Vaccination has not yet begun in most low-income countries. But there are some exceptions to this.
Corona virus
Global vaccination campaign
Have rich countries stockpiled vaccines?
At the end of 2020, Canada was criticized for buying five times more vaccines than our country's population needed.
When Donald Trump was president, Canada invested in vaccines from European vaccine companies, thinking that the US might ban vaccine exports.
Companies in Europe have not been able to keep the supply of vaccines in check, and in recent times only European countries have threatened to ban exports.
But there are also some countries that are performing better than expected.
Corona glue
At the time of writing, Serbia was the eighth most vaccinated country in the world in terms of population.
The effective implementation of the vaccination campaign is a testament to Serbia's success, but also its strategic agreement on vaccines.
Although Serbian citizens are given the option to choose the Pfizer, Sputnik or Cyanoform vaccine, in reality the majority are given the Cyanoform vaccine.
What is vaccine diplomacy?
China's influence in the region is likely to be long-lasting.
The UAE also relies heavily on Chinese vaccines.
The vaccine factories, the trained staff are all being supplied by China.
But the large supply of vaccines to the world does not mean that the population of one's own country will be the first to receive the vaccine.
China and India, two of the world's largest suppliers of vaccines, are expected to be under-vaccinated by the end of 2022, according to EIU research.
What are the challenges?
India's success as the world's largest producer of covid vaccine is, in fact, due to this one man.
But even before the vaccine's effectiveness was proven, his family had begun to question Adar Poonawala's decision to invest millions of dollars in it.
The vaccine, developed by Oxford and AstraZeneca, was adopted by the Indian government in January, and the Serum Institute now produces 2.4 million doses of the vaccine daily.
Adar tells Poonawala, "I thought that once the product was ready, the stress would go away.
He says production cannot be increased overnight.
These things take time. People think the Serum Institute has a magic wand.
Other Poonawalas started preparations for the product in March last year and started stockpiling glass vials and ingredients for the vaccine from August.
The number of vaccines produced during production can be more or less the same or things can go wrong in many stages of production.
It's about science as well as the art of adapting everything, says Agathe Demras.
The manufacturing companies that are now starting production will take several months to produce the actual vaccine.
Will Covax accelerate the delivery of vaccines?
Poonawala says his priority is to supply vaccines to India.
Which vaccine is most commonly used?
The WHO, Gavi Vaccine Scheme and the CEPI - Center for Epidemic Preparedness have all developed the CoVAX scheme.
Countries that cannot afford the vaccine will be provided with a special fund.
The vaccine will cover up to 20 per cent of the population in countries eligible for the vaccine.
Ghana became the first country to receive the vaccine on February 24 under the scheme.
But many of the countries in the Covax scheme are also trying to get vaccinated individually.
Adar Poonawala says that the leaders of almost every country in the African continent have approached him on a personal level for the vaccine.
Agathe Demrais and EIU do not have high hopes for the success of this Covax scheme.
It will make a small difference, but it won't make a big difference, says DeMrass.
The EIU estimates that some countries will not have full vaccinations by 2023, while others will never.
But as long as the virus persists, it will change itself and the infection will continue to spread.
But the good news is that vaccines are being produced faster than ever before.
Demrais says all governments need to provide real information to their people.

Corona Education: This will be a big change in your children's education system
Women
Chess teacher Anuradha Beniwal is teaching students from England and India.
From coronation in London to teaching children in government schools in remote parts of India, his experience has changed dramatically.
The availability of digital tools for digital education has become very important in India.
Beniwal told the BBC in a phone interview that there was a need to change existing education policies.
I take classes on 'Zoom' with a maximum of 10 students in London.
Many schools and universities in Delhi are now offering online education.
In many places, it was easy for us to turn to online.
But, there are some students in the school who have problems with internet connection.
Many private schools in the country have now started taking classes on the Zoom app.
On condition of anonymity, the parents of one or two children told the BBC:
Also, after talking to students, teachers and parents, I realized that the concept of a campus experience has completely changed with Corona.
Our next session is likely to be online.
Once the lockdown is over, there is also the question of how schools and universities should start again.
Some schools have used glass sheets in students.
The online education system may be a new trend, but what difference will it make in the education of students from disadvantaged groups?
Many of the girls were relieved of the hardships of home because of school.
Anuradha teaches in remote areas but even in places like Delhi, the situation is not very satisfactory.
9-year-old Rani Rajput has got admission in a government school in Delhi.
We migrated from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi in search of work.
But, we don't even have a smartphone.
In the post-Corona world, the education sector faces many challenges.
Ritesh Singh is the founder of Eckovation, a social learning platform.
Ritesh has received the Prime Minister's innovation award for creating the app Upgradation for Education.
If you want to make online learning effective, you have to contextualize and personalize it differently for each student, he adds.
For example, a video tutorial made for a student in Delhi would be irrelevant for students in remote areas like Barmer or Latehar.
Riteish and his team are developing a curriculum with regional needs in mind.
But, in the post-Corona era, the question is how the education system based on mobile applications will reach more and more students without smartphones and internet.
This is why Riteish had to think about the TV format.
He says, "A series of syllabus related sections for Class 9th and 12th has started on DD Bihar and Jharkhand from April 20.
But, there are many practical difficulties in keeping the students in front of the TV sets for a long time.
We plan to make the study material available to students through WhatsApp in the future.
Chhaya Ben is a teacher at a government girls' school in Chikodara, Gujarat.
The majority of the 380 girls in our school are from this disadvantaged group.
For students who are on one side of society, corona companionship can be a year-round loss or a long-term opportunity in education, she adds.
Anand Pradhan (24) is one of the youngest educationists in India.
Corona will have to change in order to stay in touch with the education sector in the future.
He says, "Online education is what it is and it will continue to be so.
Anand’s school emphasizes skill development and innovative thinking.
So we try to give each student a skill-based education, so that if there is a problem, it is the students who will find a solution.
But then the question arises as to how the school will ensure that extra-curricular activities will be as important as textbooks.
Bijendra is a group education officer in Rohtak district of Haryana.
We are trying to reach more students through WhatsApp.
We work late into the night to answer questions from such students.
While distributing milk powder in the village, Bijendra and his team surveyed the educational situation of every student in the village.
Even if one does not have digital tools, we are still trying to get the notes to the students through the network of people.
Whether the school is small or large, online education will be a challenge in the post-Corona era, experts say.
Corona virus: India struggles to find new variants
Different strains of the corona virus have been found around the world.
The coronavirus, which spreads the global epidemic of covid-19, also makes small changes in itself as it passes from one person to another.
Often, these small changes, called mutations, are less harmful and do not make much difference to the overall nature of the virus.
However, some mutations cause changes in the spike proteins of the virus.
A new strain or variant of the mutated virus can sometimes be fatal.
Last week, a senior US health official said that the spread of highly contagious variants could lead to a "fourth wave of illness" in the United States.
According to scientists, the variant in Brazil is more contagious and the immune system created by a single infection of the corona may not be effective on this variant.
Researchers around the world studying the genome of the virus are currently exploring such serious changes taking place in the corona virus.
India is the fifth country in the world to discover the genome of corona virus. The first case of coronavirus infection in India was reported in Kerala last January.
Although the number of covid patients across the country seems to be declining, the number of covid patients is increasing in some states.
Although the number of covid patients across the country seems to be declining, the number of covid patients is increasing in some states.
It takes a mechanism to track and store information on the genetics of local samples of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that spreads Covid-19 disease.
The number of corona victims is increasing again in many states of the country.
So far 242 patients of 3 new variants of corona virus have been found in the country.
However, scientists are studying two variants found in patient samples from Maharashtra and Telangana.
In January, a group of genome scientists said that genome sequencing was not happening at full capacity in India.
In most parts of the country, life has returned to normal.
10 genome laboratories have been set up in the country in view of the threat of corona virus variants.
Epidemiologist Dr. Shahid Jameel says, "We need to pay constant attention to the fact that there is no threat from any variant.
And that's why genome sequencing is so important.
In order to check what changes are taking place in the virus, 6000 samples collected from 22 states in India in the last 10 months have been sequenced.
According to researchers at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore has the highest number of mutations in samples compared to any other city in the country.
Researchers have found 3 variants in Bangalore.
In a large and diverse country like India, large-scale genome sequencing is not easy.
Corona sequencing is done by 10 laboratories in India.
For this, first the laboratories have to collect local samples.
Genome sequencing of a single sample can cost up to 75.
Sequencing a sample takes about 48 hours.
A virologist from Cambridge, Dr. Ravindra Kumar Gupta says that in the case of the corona virus, "sequencing is essential to know exactly what is happening.
Dr. Ravindra Kumar Gupta says, "I think sequencing is important.
However, Union Health Minister Dr. As Harshvardhan says, the emphasis is on finding variants of the "endgame of pandamic" as India is nearing the end of its coronavirus infection.
Dr. "The situation in India is good.
He goes on to say, "There is only one thing that can thwart all these efforts, and that is the new deadly variant of the Corona, and it may even be from India."
Corona: 2,000 deaths a day, the highest in Brazil
As many as 2,68,370 patients have died of corona in Brazil so far.
In Brazil, 2,000 corona patients have died in 24 hours.
Brazil has the second highest number of corona deaths in the world after the United States.
The deaths of 2,286 corona patients were recorded on Wednesday (March 10).
Infectious strains of the corona virus are increasing the incidence, experts say.
On March 10, former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva strongly criticized the decisions taken by President J बोrg Bolsonaro during the epidemic.
Bolsonaro was seen wearing a mask for the first time in a month.
Health systems in most of Brazil's major cities are under tremendous pressure and are likely to collapse, warned Fiocruz, Brazil's leading public health center.
Margaret Dalkolo, a doctor and researcher at Fiocruz, said the country had "seen the worst of the epidemic."
2021 is going to be a tough year, too, he told AFP News.
What exactly is the situation?
On Wednesday (March 10), 79,876 new corona patients were registered in the country.
On March 9, 1,972 corona patients died in Brazil.
The highly contagious type of virus has been spreading for some time now.
A total of 2,286 people died on March 10.
According to Fiocruz, 15 state capitals have intensive care units (ICUs) with a capacity of more than 90 percent.
According to reports, the capital Brasilia also now has a full-capacity ICU system.
The report warns that the growing number of corona patients could put a strain on the health system and could lead to its collapse.
Corona first patient: 'My report came a year ago and I was crying for two days'
Our report was positive and we were kept in the isolation ward.
On March 9, 2020, the first Kovid 19 positive patient in Maharashtra was diagnosed.
Savita, the first corona patient in the state, and her husband Suresh (both names have been changed) contracted covid and became the first corona in the state.
That trip to Dubai
The entire family had gone to Dubai to celebrate the 25th wedding anniversary of Suresh and Savita.
After returning from Dubai, Suresh developed a fever and a cold and initially consulted his family doctor.
But after three or four days, he did not feel well and on the advice of his family doctor, he and his wife went to Naidu Hospital on March 9 for a check-up.
When the reports came, the reports of Suresh and Savita were positive.
Some thought we would never come back ...
Suresh started talking about the early days of his treatment, "Our report was positive and our children were also called for examination.
From the second day onwards, the news of the first patient being found in Maharashtra started circulating.
Experience of isolation
Suresh and Savita did not have any physical problems as they did not have any symptoms.
Savita says, "When we got the report, we were worried that nothing would happen to us.
When we started to feel better, we made a video call to our relatives and showed them that we were cool.
After a few days of treatment, both were re-corona tested.
Positive attitude
Suresh says, "When we came home, we were welcomed in the society.
We decided to donate plasma after we were cured.
Looking at it now, a year later, it seems like we need to move on without stopping, despite all these incidents
Why do women who have recovered from corona have more menstrual problems?
Menstruation came much earlier after the corona was released.
Listening to the words of Mumbaikar Rashmi Puranik will make a thorn in the side of any woman.
But, the first shift after Corona is still not forgotten.
I had to hug my abdomen."
Political journalist Rashmi Puranik was infected with Covid-19 in June last year (2020).
Her first period came after overcoming the infection.
Rashmi goes on to say, "Every woman has a pattern of menstruation.
Rashmi had been experiencing shift shifts till December.
After the covid was released, the menstrual cramps increased a lot.
They feel that the change in menstruation is a post impact of Kovid-19.
My period was horrible.

Speaking to the BBC, Fortis Hospital gynecologist Dr. Sonal Kumta says, "Complaints of irregular menstruation, late menstruation, change in bleeding pattern, excessive bleeding have been found in women who have been discharged from the corona."
According to experts, patients with coronary heart disease show other medical problems.
Speaking to the BBC, the former head of the gynecology department at Sir JJ Hospital, Dr. Ashok Anand says, "There are documented reports of swelling of the ovaries in women after covid.
If the ovaries are swollen after a corona infection, there is a chance of discomfort or changes during the menstrual cycle, he said. Happiness continues.
The woman never had a period
Fortis Hospital gynecologist Dr. Sonal Kumta informs a female patient who was freed from the corona infection.
I had a 41-year-old woman who had a corona infection.
What is 'amenorrhea'?
According to Web-MD, 'amenorrhea' means no menstruation.
Menstruation
If a woman has this problem, she will not have menstruation.
Corona and menstruation?
Experts say there is no concrete evidence that corona has a direct effect on the menstrual cycle.
The gynecologist of Hiranandani Hospital, Dr. Manjiri Mehta says, Menstrual changes cannot be directly linked to Covid-19.
Mumbai-based gynecologist Dr. No woman has come to Komal Chavan complaining of menstrual problems after he was released from the corona.
Speaking to the BBC, she said: "Women's menstrual periods change after a long-term illness.
Pet pain
But it needs to be studied, he said. Komal has an opinion.
Changes in the female reproductive system after covid?
Corona infection weakens the body's immune system.
Decreased immunity after covid is likely to weaken the reproductive system.
What should women do?
According to gynecologists, women should take care of themselves
Proper diet, exercise is essential

Did women have menstrual problems in the lockdown?
Dr. Manjiri adds, "Women with PCOD (Polycystic Ovary Disease) did not exercise during the lockdown.
Is Patanjali's Coronil a treatment for Corona?
The combination of herbal medicines is once again claimed to be effective against the corona virus.
There is no evidence that this drug is effective in treating corona.
What is known about coronal context?
Coronil is a blend of medicinal plants traditionally used in Indian medicine.
The drug was first mentioned in June last year.
The marketing of this drug was stopped after the intervention of the Government of India.
The government also said that coronil could be sold as an 'immunity booster'.
Coronil
On February 19, the company held another event.
Union Health Minister Dr. Harshvardhan was criticized by the Indian Medical Association, India's largest association of doctors, for attending the event.
The publicity of 'unscientific medicine' in the presence of the Health Minister is an insult to the people of India and does the Health Minister support this medicine?
Dr. program. We contacted the Ministry of Health to inquire about the presence of Harshvardhan, but we did not receive any response till the article was published.
The Patanjali Company supported the ministers' presence and said, "They did not support Ayurveda (India's traditional medicine) or the modern medical system."
Claims made against the coronal
The company repeatedly claims that its product treats corona. "People have been treated with this drug," Patanjali's managing director Acharya Balkrishna told the BBC.
The company says that scientific tests of the drug have been carried out and the results have been published in several international journals.
For this, the company mentioned a magazine published by MDPI in Switzerland in November 2020.
The experiment was performed on fish.
A global health expert at the University of Southampton in the UK, Dr. Michael Head told the BBC there was a difference between taking pre-clinical trials in a laboratory and getting regulatory approval for something that worked on humans.
He says, "Many drugs respond well in the laboratory but when tested on humans, the drug does not work for a variety of reasons."
Human testing was performed on 95 patients who tested positive for the corona virus between May and June last year.
The findings are being published in the April 2021 issue of Science Direct, Patanjali Company said.
The company said that patients who were given coronal drugs recovered faster than patients who were not given the drug.
It is for these reasons that these conclusions are being called into question.
Has Coronil got official approval?
In December 2020, the Patanjali Company in Uttarakhand asked the state administration to convert Coronil's 'Immunity Booster' license into 'Covid-19' drug.
The company said Coronil was approved in January as a "supportive measure."
The state administration told the BBC that the company had been given a new license but that the drug could not be given as a treatment for corona.
The Director of the Traditional Medical and State Licensing Authority, Dr. Y.S. "Coronil can be sold as a modified license means Zika, Vitamin C, Multi Vitamin or any other supplement," Rawat told the BBC.
“There’s no coronary treatment,” the director explained.
The company also claims to have received the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certificate.
Senior official Rakesh Mittal said in a tweet that Coronel was approved by the WHO but the tweet was later deleted.
India's top drug regulator provides GMP certification under a WHO approved scheme.
Dr. Uttarakhand State Government. Rawat said, "The GMP certificate has nothing to do with the effectiveness of the claim.
The WHO clarified to the BBC that "the effectiveness of any conventional medicine for the treatment of Covid-19 has not been certified."
Dr. at the University of Southampton. "There is still no clear evidence that these products are beneficial for the treatment or prevention of Covid-19," says Head.

Corona: Can a person be infected with corona even after vaccination?
It was November 17, 2009. An 11-year-old boy returned to the United States from the UK.
One week later, the boy attended a religious education program in Sullivan County, New York.
CLICK HERE to select your favorite Indian female player
During this time the religious education program continued.
After the children returned home from the program, the virus spread to Brooklyn and Rockhall County, as well as Ocean County and Orange County.
When scientists analyzed all of this, they said that the Chavarusa teaching method had led to the spread of the mumps virus.
Surprisingly in this case, one of the 'super-spreaders' was vaccinated against MMR (measles, mumps and rubella).
In fact, most vaccines relieve symptoms but do not completely protect against infection.
‘Effective’ and ‘sterile’ immunity
Vaccines provide two main types of immunity.
The second is 'sterile immunity', which can completely prevent infection.
Can a person still be infected with corona after vaccination?
Let's take the example of meningitis.
These bacteria hide in the back of the nose or throat.
The Meningitidis vaccine can have two different effects, says Keith Neal, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Nottingham.
How does sterilization immunity work?
An effective immune system usually provides a combination of white blood cells - including B and T cells - with pretty antibodies.
These antibodies stick to the outside and prevent contact with the nose, throat, or lungs. Protects the body as a whole.
In the case of Covid-19, the deficiency of antibodies that identify the virus is linked to the spike protein on its surface, which is used to penetrate the cells.
In order to achieve sterile immunity, vaccines need to promote adequate antibodies to catch any virus particles that enter the body and destroy them immediately.
What type of immunity does the covid-19 vaccine produce?
In short, we know nothing. Because it's still very new, says Neil.
So far, no tests have been performed on the corona vaccine to determine whether the virus can spread.
This means we keep our focus more pragmatically, says Professor Danny Altman.
Scientists already know that antibodies that develop in people after a natural infection with Covid-19 cannot always prevent re-infection.
A study by British healthcare workers found that 17 per cent of those who had antibodies already - probably the first time - were re-infected.
I think there's a lot of questioning about the vaccine for this type of virus.
Fortunately, this is not the end of the story.
There have been recent indications that some vaccines may not completely eradicate the virus, but they can prevent infection.
It is very difficult to prove disinfection immunity.
Since many medical tests have not tested whether the vaccine can stop the spread of the virus, scientists are now looking at how many infections have been detected where large quantities of the vaccine have been distributed.
However, it is difficult to understand exactly, because there are two things.
Let us look at the lymphatic potential.
Oxford-Astrazhenka
The vaccine was tested on Rhesus macaque in July last year.
The author noted that the vaccine does not prevent the spread of the disease.
Let us now turn to the third stage.
According to the results of the test, published in January 2021, those who were given half the dose of the vaccine were 59 percent successful in preventing the virus from infecting them.
Infection figures among those taking half the dose of the vaccine looked promising.
The papers, published in pre-print on February 1, present a few things by studying the people who participated in the tests.
Pfizer-Bioentech
There is still no conclusive evidence that the Pfizer-Bioentech vaccine can prevent people from getting the corona virus.
In early January, Albert Borla, chief executive of the Pfizer vaccine, said tests on the animals showed that the infection did not occur after the vaccine was given.
An Israeli survey found that only two out of 102 medical staff who were given two doses of the vaccine developed "low" levels of antibodies.
Of course, caution is needed in the analysis of these results.
Recently, the Israeli Ministry of Health looked at the health records of 1 million people in the country and found that only 317 out of 7,15,425 people tested positive for corona in a week after the full vaccination.
Again, this was not a medical test, there was no control group, and things like lockdowns could result in lower results, however, the incidence of infection was significantly reduced.
A study by the National Institutes of Health, the McCabe Healthcare Service, found similar results.
Modern
Although the modern test did not pay special attention to whether the vaccine prevents infection, participants were tested for corona infection before taking their first and second doses - meaning it was possible to compare the prevalence of infection in these groups.
It found that two-thirds of asymptomatic people were saved from infection after a single dose.
Novavax
This vaccine has not yet been approved for use anywhere in the world.
According to the company, a study of rhesus macaques prevented the virus from spreading completely when they were given high doses.
These results have included this vaccine in a specific group, which can completely prevent asymptomatic infections.
Now scientists are awaiting the discovery of whether even vaccinated humans can get sterile immunity.
Incomplete herd immunity
Unfortunately, the vaccine's ability to prevent the spread of the virus depends not only on the rules of social discrimination, but also on the effect of herd immunity.
If these vaccines don't completely stop the infection, there will be a need for vaccinations to boost herd immunity, says Michael Head.
Heard immunity is used to provide indirect protection against infectious diseases in people who are immune enough.
Despite the fact that scientists know so much, it is not possible to say with certainty that herd immunity is universally applicable.
For example, according to one statistic, 60-72 percent of the population needs immunity to completely eradicate the infection.
This is even higher than the vaccination targets of many countries.
However, many scientists believe that the corona virus cannot be completely eradicated.
Some scientists say that once enough people have been vaccinated, it is not important whether they are able to spread the virus, but whether everyone will have immunity.
However, for those who cannot be vaccinated, herd immunity is a good option.
Until all this happens, you should remember the story of the 11-year-old boy with mumps that you mentioned at the beginning.
Joe Biden: President's signatures on 10 executive orders to fight Kovid on the battlefield
President Joe Biden has made 10 important decisions to intensify the fight against cowardice 19 in the United States.
Accordingly, the speed of vaccination will be increased and the number of covid tests will also be increased.
Although it will take a few months to overcome this scourge, we will definitely get out of it if everyone comes together, Biden said while announcing these 10 decisions.
Biden's decision comes just days after he was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States.
The new administration has parted ways with former President Donald Trump's policies.
The way the Trump administration handled the issue of Covid's accomplice was widely criticized.
The United States has been hit hardest by the corona virus worldwide, killing more than 4.6 million people so far, according to Johns Hopkins University.
'War situation'
Mr Biden said there was a "big price" to pay for "concrete decisions".
One thing I want to make clear - the situation will worsen and then it will improve, Biden warned.
It's a war situation, he said.
Biden said his plan to vaccinate 100 million people in the first 100 days of his term was "the biggest administrative challenge our country has ever faced."
It will only get worse before the situation improves, President Biden has said.
Anthony Fauchi, chief medical adviser, said the Biden administration was increasing the capacity and scope of existing vaccination schemes.
As expected, if 70 to 85 per cent of the population is vaccinated by the end of summer, life is likely to be somewhat normal by winter, he said.
It will be important to persuade those who are skeptical about the vaccine to get it. Fauchi said.
He said the administration was in talks with some growers to increase vaccine production.
So far, 1.65 million vaccines have been administered in the United States.
What is the new plan?
The administration has announced a seven-phase plan.
The plan calls for the Biden administration to take swift and aggressive action to protect and assist those most at risk of cowardice and those working in essential services.
Biden has made 10 decisions to fight Covid on the battlefield.
The executive order approved by Biden does not need to be approved by the US Congress.
The administration aims to start vaccination centers in stadiums and buildings for local communities and reopen most schools within 100 days.
In addition, before embarking on a journey to the United States, passengers will now have to undergo a covid test to show that their report is negative and will have to be quarantined for 14 days upon arrival in the United States.
Wearing of masks and observing social distance will be mandatory in all government office premises and wearing of masks will also be mandatory in airports, most of the planes, trains and buses.
More financial assistance will be provided to state and local administration officials, and a new office will be set up to oversee implementation across the country.
Production of PPE kits and vaccines will be increased.
The Biden administration has made another decision that deviates from the Trump administration's policies.
What did these 3 Marathi doctors feel after getting the corona vaccine?
Vaccination is starting in India from January 16.
In most countries, vaccinations are preferably given to health care workers, the elderly, or those with cancer.
The vaccination process is somewhat similar everywhere.
The vaccine is given after the side effects have been reported or a consent form has been signed.
How is the experience after vaccination?
Dr. Nikita Bilgi lives in Philadelphia, USA and works as a physical therapist.
We can't stop treating patients because they need physiotherapy after surgery.
On January 9, Nikita received her first dose of the modern vaccine.
But in twenty-four hours the pain subsided.
Nikita has another purpose behind getting vaccinated.
The United States did not have a complete lockdown, but Philadelphia had a semi-lockdown in November-December.
It's important to keep wearing a mask even after getting the vaccine.
Dr. Ashutosh Tondare is a breast cancer surgeon originally from Aurangabad.
"I got the Pfizer vaccine, because it was the only vaccine available when I went to get the vaccine.
The UK is currently experiencing another wave of covid epidemics, so Ashutosh feels the vaccine has arrived at the right time.
The situation is not good, the number of patients is increasing.
Dr. Ameya Kunte is a medical oncologist and oncologist who has been living and working in a hospital in Hamburg, Germany for five years.
The second wave is going on here, the cases were increasing before Christmas.
Even when the first wave of covid came, Dr. Amay was working in the hospital.
There was a time when there was no space left to keep the patients in isolation.
Ameya says the government has provided vaccines to large hospitals in Germany.
Pfizer Bioentech and Modern vaccines are recognized in Europe.
"I started the new year with the vaccine.
It is not clear how long the vaccine will last, or whether it will have some long-term effects, but he says the benefits should be taken into account.

But a new method is being used to make a vaccine against the corona virus.
How many people need the coronavirus vaccine?
This is a very serious question this year and perhaps this century.
If the corona vaccine became available and became effective, a few hundred billion people worldwide would have to be vaccinated.
Who will be vaccinated first?
Therefore, in the early stages, it is necessary to plan who should be vaccinated.
This is because people in this age group have a higher mortality rate due to Covid-19.
What to do until vaccinated?

Corona covacin: What is the controversial covacin vaccine?
The Central Drug Controller General has approved the indigenous vaccine 'Covacin' against the Covid-19 virus.
However, the vaccine has been found to be in dispute after emergency use was approved.
The vaccine test has not been completed.
What is covacin?
Covacin is a vaccine against the corona virus.
According to the Central Drug Controller General, covacin is made from inactivated corona virus.
According to experts, the virus cannot be infected because it is inactive.
Who developed the covacin vaccine?
The vaccine is manufactured by Bharat Biotech Company, Hyderabad.
The vaccine is being developed jointly by Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research
At what stage is covacin produced?
There are three stages in vaccine production.
The first two phases of the covacin test have been completed.
According to the Central Inspector General of Drugs, the third phase of the covacin vaccine is currently being tested.
Bharat Biotech President Dr. Speaking to reporters, Krishna Ila said, "24000 volunteers have been registered in the third phase trial of Kovacin.
Is covacin safe?
Covacin has the ability to detect altered strains of the corona virus, according to the Subject Expert Committee.
In the first and second phase, 800 people were vaccinated, while in the third phase, 22,500 people have been vaccinated so far.
Central Director General of Drugs Dr. V. J. According to Somani, ‘Covacin has been manufactured on the Viro Cell platform.
Covacin was found to be safe during the test.
The company claims that the vaccine is safe and effective in animal tests.
How does the covacin vaccine work?
After the vaccine is injected, the body's immune system will recognize the virus.
Tests for covacin showed increased levels of antibodies in the body, according to central officials.
Controversy over Covaxi's approval
A third phase clinical trial of covacin is underway.
Is the vaccine effective?
So, it is alleged by the political parties that the government has resorted to classical protocol to make its own chest grow.
Why was Covacin allowed for emergency use?
This was discussed by the Subject Expert Committee before the covacin was approved.
• December 30, 2020- Expert Committee recommends that India Biotech be informed of immunogenicity, safety and vaccine effectiveness.
• January 1, 2021 - The committee noted that the new strain of Las Corona is effective.
• January 2, 2021 - The company presented research on animals.
In view of the above, the Committee recommended that ‘in view of the wider public interest and precautionary measures, the vaccine should be allowed for restricted use in emergency situations in clinical trials’.
It was mentioned that if the corona virus mutated or changed, it should be allowed to have alternatives.
A cold storage in Mumbai
Steps in approving the vaccine
There are three stages in vaccine production.
Dr. Nagpur in Maharashtra. The first and second stages of covacin were tested at Gillurkar Multispeciality Hospital.
Stage 1 - Does anyone suffer after vaccination?
Stage II - This is followed by another dose of vaccine on the 14th day.
What is the safety and efficacy of the vaccine?
The vaccine is considered safe if it does not cause serious side effects on the body.
The efficiency of the vaccine is very important.
The chief scientist of the World Health Organization, Dr. Saumya Swaminathan said in a press conference, "Generally, if the vaccine is 70 per cent or more effective, we can call it a vaccine.
If the vaccine is less than 30 per cent effective, it will not have a good effect.
Is there any risk due to approval in the third phase of the clinical trial?
No information has been released about the third phase of the test.
What is the benefit to the common man?
Experts believe that in the current situation, there is no point in allowing covacin to the general public.
The President of AIDS Society of India, Dr. Ishwari Prasad Gilada says, "Whether the covacin is effective has not been made public yet.
Doctors will consider giving the vaccine as they do not know about the vaccine and people will oppose taking the vaccine.
Experts say the government will consider covacaine if at some point there is a sudden shortage of vaccines or cases increase.
Corona Vaccine: Why exactly was there a dispute between Serum and Bharat Biotech?
The beginning of the new year was a relief for all Indians.
On January 2, there was a dry run of Corona Lashi across the country.
On Sunday (January 3), the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) approved two anti-corona vaccines in India.
But a statement by Adar Poonawala, owner of Serum Institute of India (SII), sparked controversy.
What exactly is an argument?
In an interview, Adar Poonawala said, "Only three vaccines, Pfizer, Moderna and Covishield, have passed all the scientific tests.
After Adar Poonawala's statement, the effectiveness of Bharat Biotech's 'Covacin' vaccine began to be questioned.
Dr. Krishna Ila said, "We are 200 per cent humble about our medical tests and yet we face criticism.
Of course, Dr. Although Krishna Ila did not name anyone, his target was Adar Poonawala.
Opinions were also expressed in the political arena.
Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot tweeted that the dispute between Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech was unfortunate.
Gehlot also expressed the need for the Prime Minister to intervene in the dispute.
After realizing that the controversy was escalating, Serum Institute owner Adar Poonawala tweeted an explanation.
Shortly afterwards, Serum Institute owner Adar Poonawala and Bharat Biotech's managing director Dr. Krishna Ila issued a joint statement.
What is in the joint letter of 'Serum' and 'Bharat Biotech'?
Other Poonawala and Dr. Krishna Ila spoke on behalf of both Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech and discussed the production of corona vaccine and the supply of vaccine worldwide, including in India, the statement said.
The main challenge before us is to save the lives of people all over the world, including India, they said.
Both vaccines (Covishield and Covacin) have been approved by the EUA for emergency use.
Overall, Poonawala and Dr. Krishna Ila tried to cover up the controversy in the joint letter and said that there was harmony between the two vaccine companies.
When an attempt is made to suppress anti-government voices under the name of Corona ...
Safura Jargar was arrested in April.
Safura Jargar was three months pregnant when she was arrested in the Indian capital, Delhi.
By the time she was arrested on April 10, the number of corona virus cases in India was growing rapidly.
The government had made it clear in its guidelines that corona health crises could be more dangerous for pregnant women.
After Safura's release from jail, he spoke to BBC correspondent Geeta Pandey.
Critics of the Citizenship Amendment Act describe the law as "aimed at the Muslim community."
An epidemic caused by the corona virus
But no one took to the streets to demand his release.
The lockdown was imposed in India on March 25 due to the corona virus.
But while all these reactions are taking place, the popularity of many governments has increased as people sought the help of the government for guidelines in times of crisis.
Joseph Benedict of Sivakas, a global coalition of civil society organizations and activists, told the BBC:
It also means that man and civil rights have taken a step back.
Civic's report
According to a recent report by Civicus, "Several governments in the Asia-Pacific region have banned publishers of reports of government harassment.
Apart from this, monitoring and trekking has also increased.
At least 26 countries in the region have enacted strict laws, according to the Civicus report.
A shocking message
Apart from Safoor, all other human rights defenders and activists in India (including 82-year-old Father Stein Swami Parkinson's disease) have been arrested on charges of treason, criminal defamation and anti-terrorism.
This situation has inspired many organizations to raise their voices.
Maitreyi Gupta, India's legal adviser to the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), told the BBC that he had repeatedly tried to free political prisoners.
However, despite international pressure, the arrests continue unabated.
The government has always tried to show that those arrested are acting against the interests of the country.
During an epidemic
The arrest of Tericita Knoll, a 62-year-old activist in the Philippines, has caused a stir.
Knoll is suffering from heart disease and asthma and was arrested on charges of kidnapping and illegal hostage-taking.
Most of these people were either activists or journalists.
Meanwhile, Abz-CBN, the country's largest media network, was forcibly shut down in May.
As a result, many important information did not reach the people during the epidemic.
Attack on freedom
Bangladesh also shut down several websites.
Bidya Shrestha, a Newar activist in Nepal, told the BBC that the government had used the epidemic to harm the Newar community.
The Civicus report also mentions Cambodia, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.
Myanmar has also been criticized for using extremism as an excuse to suppress freedom of expression.
However, sometimes government action is not directly linked to the epidemic.
Attack on freedom
The National Security Act was passed in Hong Kong in June.
The use of surveillance technology in countries such as South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong has played a very effective role in controlling the virus.
Many of the laws passed this year and the arrests are likely to have a lasting effect even after the epidemic.
Corona: Uddhav Thackeray will inform the Center about the segregation of those who have traveled abroad
Eight passengers from Maharashtra who returned from the UK were found to have symptoms of the new corona, including five from Mumbai, one each from Pune, Thane and Mira Bhayandar.
All of them are in segregation and their contact tracing is underway.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray today (January 4) held a meeting at Varsha on corona vaccination and discussed with the health department and the municipal commissioner about the new virus that has infected eight passengers from Britain and instructed them to be more vigilant.
The dry run of the corona vaccination took place recently.
The Chief Minister said that passengers arriving in Mumbai directly from the UK are sent to the airport for institutional segregation as per the rules.
Eight passengers infected with the new corona virus are currently undergoing institutional isolation and are being monitored.
A new strain of corona virus was found in the UK
News of the discovery of a new strain of the corona virus in the UK has been circulating for the past few days.
The new species is spreading faster than the original species of corona virus. But this species is not very lethal.
Corona virus vaccines are currently being marketed.
But it is not yet clear how the vaccine affects the new species of corona.
Why are corona covshield and covacin vaccines being objected to?
The Drug Controller General of India - DCGI on Sunday approved two vaccines on Covid-19 for emergency use.
Two vaccines, Covishield and Covacin, have been approved.
After the UK approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in emergencies, it was speculated that Kovishield would also be allowed in India.
Some other health workers, including the Congress party, have objected to the early approval of Kovacin.
What are the objections?
How was this permission granted without disclosing the test results of the third phase of both Covishield and Covacin vaccines?
During the third phase of testing for a vaccine, the vaccine is tested on a large number of groups, and the test results determine the percentage of people who are found to be effective.
The results of the third phase tests of Pfizer Bioentech, Oxford-Astrazenka and Mordana vaccines, which are recognized in different countries around the world, are different.
In India, along with covacin, there are also objections to how effective Covishield is.
Covishield was tested in the third phase on 1,600 volunteers in India, and its figures have not yet been released.
The first and second phases of the vaccine were tested on 800 volunteers, and the third phase of the trial is expected to test the vaccine on 22,500 people, but no figures have been released.
Who took the objection?
Congress leader Shashi Tharoor tweeted after Kovacin was allowed to be used for emergencies.
Tagging the Union Health Minister, he said, "The third phase of testing for the covacin has not yet taken place.
After Shashi Tharoor's tweet, the political discussion started.
Doctors are in a dilemma about these vaccines. Called Swapnil Parikh.
I think it's time to get rid of the regulator's hurdles and get the process done as soon as possible.
After the opposition and many health workers raised questions, Union Health Minister Dr. Harshvardhan tweeted that Kovacin is effective.
In the first tweet, he says, "It is a shame for anyone to politicize on such a serious issue.
The Union Health Minister later tweeted several times in support of Kovacin, but did not mention the figures for the third phase of testing.
Vaccines based on encoded spike proteins, which are recognized worldwide, are up to 90 percent effective and covacin contains other antigenic episodes along with inactivated virus-based spike proteins, making the vaccine as safe and effective as any other vaccine.
The covacin vaccine is also effective on newer variants of the corona virus. Harshvardhan said.
He also tweeted that Kovacin had been approved for emergency use on certain conditions.
He says, "Those who spread rumors that emergency use of covacin in clinical trial mode is subject to certain conditions should be noted.
What do the test takers say?
Dr. Nagpur. The first two phases of covacin were being tested at Gillurkar Multispeciality Hospital.
The covacin vaccine has not been shown to have any major adverse effects on the body.
"Sometimes it feels like a fever after being vaccinated.
What does Bharat Biotech have to say?
Krishna Illa, president of Bharat Biotech, which manufactures covacin, has issued a statement in this regard.
But neither Bharat Biotech nor DCGI have provided any statistics on how effective and safe the vaccine is.
The head of AIIMS Hospital in Delhi, Dr. Speaking to ANI, Randeep Guleria said, "Suppose there is a sudden increase in cases in case of emergency and if the vaccine is needed, the Bharat Biotech vaccine will be used.
Commenting on Guleria's statement, senior journalist Tavalin Singh said, "What exactly does this mean?
It has been called the 'indigenous vaccine' since its inception.
After the two vaccines were allowed, Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote in a tweet, "The two vaccines that have been allowed for emergency use are both made in India.
Shekhar Gupta, a senior journalist, writes about Lashi's nationalism:
Saying that this vaccine is 'Made in India', Prime Minister Modi expressed his pride, while BJP chief J. P. Nadda tweeted criticizing the opposition.
He tweeted that the Congress is not proud of any Indian thing.
He writes, "Congress and the Opposition are not proud of any Indian thing.
Both of these vaccines are 110 percent safe. G. Somani said.
After both vaccines are approved for emergency use, the vaccine will now be given to health workers and frontline workers first.
India aims to vaccinate 300 million people by July 2021.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tweeted that with the approval of the vaccines, India will now move towards coronation-free.
After the DCGI press conference, Adar Punawala, head of the Serum Institute of India, tweeted that the covshield vaccine was safe, effective.
Indian Drug Controller V. G. Somani also spoke about the potential of covishield and covacin.
If there had been any breach of safety, the Indian drug regulator would not have given the go-ahead.
The coronavirus vaccines were allowed, which means the Indian government can now enter into agreements with both companies.
The Indian government is trying to vaccinate 300 million people this year.
India Biotech's Kovaxi Nala allowed

Covid vaccine labels may not have Vaccine Wheel Monitors (VVM) and expiry date.
Make a comprehensive distribution system for the vaccine.
According to the central government, vaccination is a major challenge in a country of 130 crore people.
Also, public concern and questions about who will be vaccinated first will be a challenge.
Rumors, negative news and misinformation about the effects of vaccines can be spread on social media.
How will the vaccination be done?
The vaccination team will consist of five people, PTI said.
According to the rules, "100 people will be vaccinated in each session.
The covid vaccine will be given for the first time to health workers, frontline workers and people over the age of 50.
Only after the completion of all these vaccinations will the general public be vaccinated according to their availability.
Based on the availability of vaccines, people over the age of 50 can be classified.
According to the rules, the central government plans to vaccinate 30 crore people in the first phase of the vaccination drive.
Citizens need to register on the Co-Win website to get vaccinated.
2020: About Corona and Living with Corona - Blog
It should not be a surprise to find such records as the Covid Sun or the Corona Sun in the near future, as is the case with AD or Hijri.
Leave out the fun part of it but there is no denying that our lives have changed internally and externally in this one year.
The traveling guest landed
From November 2019 to February 2020, we talked a lot about the corona virus in BBC World. But at the time, the news might have seemed as interesting as 'Some Hubei province in China, some Wuhan city where a virus called corona is spreading'.
But from February, the picture began to change.
All this time as a journalist it was unimaginable challenges.
The baby was six months old at the time, so items such as tripods and microphones were not a threat, but the situation was likely to change soon.
Journalists often talk about 'beats'.
Put aside the superpowers etc. for a moment but still regret the fact that you have to constantly beg for common things like wash your hands, don't spit in the open.
The joke is that our 15-year-old boy imitates anyone who comes into the house to wash his hands and points to the bathroom.
Exiting after 17 days of quarantine
Things like shift time constraints, personal and professional boundaries and timelines became loose throughout the year.
The incessant efforts of scientists, doctors, and pharmacists to control the disease were astounding.
The latest research from around the world should be told to them and then posts like 'Corona dies after eating garlic' or 'Corona is a rumor to fill the pockets of pharma companies' should be seen on their social media accounts.
The grief of those who lost their jobs, their homes, their loved ones was great, but this black cloud also had a silver lining.
'Don't be positive, Dad!'
For several weeks in a BBC Marathi podcast, I used to tell the three-pronged audience to wash their hands at least once, use a mask and keep a distance.
I don't remember ever wanting a positive result in my life, but in the case of Corona, it happened.
17 days! The day was getting darker and darker in all the three triple doses of medicine, finger oximeter, temperature measurement.
The flaws in the health system that were known from the experiences of others could now be experienced.
After 14 days, 'Arogya Setu' voluntarily turned red and green and we were healed automatically by the government court.
During Covid's time, the journey was almost short.
Every day, every year we are being taught something without knowing it.
Narendra Modi: 'People will get vaccine produced in India'
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that efforts are in the final stages to ensure that the vaccine produced in India reaches all sections of the country expeditiously.
No vaccine has yet been approved by Indian regulators.
The vaccines currently being produced in India include Serum Institute's Covishield, Zydus Cadillac's Zykov D, Bharat Biotech's Covaxin and Dr.
Earlier, the head of the Vaccine Task Force and a member of the Policy Commission, Dr. V. K. Speaking about the cold storage system in India, Paul had said that cold storage at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees has been set up to store the vaccine.
Ultra cold storage is required for storage of Modern or Pfizer vaccines.
What did Modi say?
Modi unveils cornerstone of AIIMS at Rajkot, Gujarat.
PTI has reported in this regard.
Preparations for corona vaccination in India are in the final stages.
Issues raised by Modi -
The number of corona victims in the country is declining.
Modi has also said that the Ayushman Bharat Yojana has saved Rs 30,000 crore for the poor.
Earlier I used to say that if there is no medicine then there is no laxity, even medicine and strictness.
Today is the last day of the year to thank the millions of doctors, cleaners, and drugstore staff who work in Corona.
Corona: Another 14 new corona patients were found in India, bringing the total to 20
Patients with a new strain of the corona virus found in Britain are now found in India as well.
Out of these 20 patients, 8 patients are in Delhi alone, while seven patients have been registered in the lab in Bangalore.
According to the central government, those returning to India from the UK are being traced between November 25 and December 23.
On the other hand, such flights from UK to India and from India to UK will be closed till January 7.
Experts say the new strain is spreading faster than the previous corona virus.
More than one crore people have been infected with corona in India so far.
A new strain of the corona virus, Strain, can wreak havoc and get your health system out of control, said Critical Care Expert Dr. A. Fatahuddin had expressed this while speaking to the BBC.
Work is underway to find citizens who have come in contact with six Indians infected with the new corona virus.
RT-PCR tests are being conducted on all passengers arriving in India from the UK at all international airports in the country.
Samples of patients coming corona positive are sent to a government-approved laboratory for genome sequencing.
Over the past month, 33,000 passengers have arrived in India from the UK.
A new strain of the corona virus has once again led to restrictions on tourism around the world.
The number of patients with the new type of corona is growing rapidly in the UK.
What is the new type of corona?
The new variant, first discovered in southern England in September, has been blamed for the rapid spread of the new virus in recent weeks due to an increase in positive cases in London, south-east England and the east of England.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that two-thirds of those found to be corona positive may have a new strain of corona.
In the new type of corona, three factors appear to come together.
The new strain is rapidly replacing other versions of the virus.
The new type of mutation affects some parts of the virus.
Some of these mutations have already been shown in the laboratory to increase the ability of cells to increase infection in viruses.
For these reasons, the new strain could spread more rapidly, says James Gallagher, the BBC's health and science correspondent.
Corona vaccine: The use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is recognized in the UK
The Oxford vaccine has been developed in record time.
The use of a vaccine developed by Oxford University to prevent coronavirus infection has been approved in the UK.
This recognition could be crucial in terms of accelerating the vaccination campaign in the UK.
The UK has ordered 100 million vaccines from AstraZeneca, a company that produces vaccines.
Approved by drug regulators, this vaccine has proven to be safe and effective.
Oxford-AstraZeneca began developing the vaccine in early 2020.
The Pfizer-BayTech vaccine was approved in the UK in December.
The first dose of the vaccine was given to Margaret Keenan after clinical trials.
Now that the Oxford-AstraZenka vaccine has been approved, there will be a huge increase in vaccinations, as the vaccine is cheaper and easier to produce in large quantities.
Most importantly, the vaccine can be stored in a general freezer.
Preference will be given to senior citizens, residents of care homes, health workers for vaccination.
The vaccine was approved after Public Health England said the rate of infection was rising rapidly, as well as health workers in Wales, Scotland and the South of England expressing concern about increasing pressure on the National Health Service (NHS).
How does this vaccine work?
In traditional vaccines - ie vaccines given to infants from time to time after birth as well as in childhood - the virus is implanted in the body by weakening a part of the original virus or by weakening the original virus.
Instead, Oxford researchers created the ChAdOx1-chimpanzee adenovirus Oxford.
Scientists have discovered a virus that infects chimpanzees.
Before Covid, 330 people were vaccinated against ChAdOx1.
The vaccine, which is made from the chimpanzee virus, has undergone genetically modified changes, so humans are less likely to become infected after being vaccinated.
It contains a blueprint for the corona virus.
When this blueprint enters the body, it begins to produce the corona virus spike protein.
Is 2020 the year with the highest number of deaths in human history?
The coming year 2020 will go down in history as the 'Year of the Corona'.
The conflict in the Middle Ages, the Great War of the last century, took place in selected parts of the world.
Death figures were coming in daily from each province.
There are two parts to this question.
Heart disease is the leading cause of death
The spread of the corona virus spread rapidly, and the death toll from around the world was alarming.
But is that the highest number of human deaths due to corona this year?
In one of his articles, the World Economic Forum has given statistics on human deaths due to other causes in the wake of the horrific deaths caused by corona worldwide this year.
According to those figures, when a total of 5.6 crore people died worldwide in that year, 1 lakh 47 thousand 118 people died every day.
According to the statistics, 10724 people died every day due to respiratory disorders, 7010 people died due to lung infections and 2615 people died due to HIV / AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO), in an article published on December 9, 2020, has given the statistics of deaths in 2019.
Heart disease and respiratory disorders are the first two major causes of death in millions.
Non-communicable diseases accounted for 74 percent of all deaths in 2019.
If we compare these figures with the worldwide deaths due to corona infection so far this year, we get a clear idea.
This figure is even lower than the number of deaths from heart disease worldwide each year.
But if it caused the most human deaths, the answer is a resounding no.
Previous global crises and human deaths
The second part of our original question may have come to the minds of many when they heard these death figures from all over the world during the Coronation period.
Human history has to deal with adversity even in the face of adversity, to fight toxins when medical knowledge and technology were not available, to quench hunger when economics did not carry out a comprehensive plan to satisfy everyone's hunger, the many wars imposed by the dream of expansionism.
Therefore, even before this, we have seen many such incidents in history when death has been like a torment.
The most unfortunate of these was 1918, when the Spanish flu swept the world.
The world was recovering from the devastation of World War I, and the Spanish flu was spreading.
In India, too, the plague had taken its toll, killing about 18 million people. It was about 6 per cent of India's population at that time.
That was a century ago, so medical knowledge was also less than it is today.
Many lives are lost in a short period of time in wars.
World War II is considered to be the worst ever.
Many deaths were reported, many not understood.
One more year can be said to be the history of India which witnessed the ordeal of death in 1943 when there was a famine in Bengal.
The death toll in the then British Empire is said to be six times higher than in World War II.
Then World War II broke out and the soldiers were criticized for not reaching the hungry in Bengal due to food shortages.
There are many periods in history in which human life ended before their natural period.
The only record here is that even more devastating periods have come and gone and there are still more life-threatening medical crises than corona, but man is still standing.
Corona: Journalist jailed for reporting infection in Wuhan
A Chinese journalist covering a corona infection in Wuhan has been sentenced to four years in prison.
The arrested journalist was identified as Zhang Zhan.
Zhang Zhan, 37, was arrested in May. She had been fasting for the past few months.
Zhang was one of several civilian journalists who were affected by the Wuhan crisis.
There are no independent media in China.
Zhang Zhan looked very exhausted after the sentencing, Ren Quanyu, one of Zhan's lawyers, told AFP.
While reading the verdict, Zhang's mother burst into tears in court, Ren said.
'Rebellious Personality'
In a video interview with a filmmaker before his arrest, Zhang said he decided to go to Wuhan in February after reading a post written by a citizen about the city's environment during the Corona outbreak.
Once there, Zhang began to write about the pictures he saw on the streets of Wuhan, as well as in the hospital.
According to the Network of Chinese Human Rights Defenders, Zhang's report stated that he had written about the arrests of other journalists as well as the harassment of families expecting accountability from the government.
Maybe I was rebellious from the beginning and just trying to bring out the truth.
I'm not going to stop what I'm doing.
According to the CHRD, Zhang had been missing since May 14.
He was charged in November.
Zhang was also accused of giving interviews to foreign media and spreading false information about the infection in Wuhan.
Zhang went on a hunger strike to protest his arrest, and his condition worsened.
When I met Zhang in early December, he was being force-fed through a tube, Zhang's lawyers said in a statement.
They also needed help to get to the bathroom.
Zhang was also arrested in 2019.
Leo Lan, an adviser at CHRD, said it was a "warning" to respond to Zhang's sentencing.
The sentence handed down to them is harsh.
I am also concerned about other civilians who have been detained for reporting on corona infections.
Journalists Li Zhehua, Shen Qishi and Fang Bin, who covered the situation in Wuhan, were also missing.
Lee came forward a few days ago. He accused her of forcibly quarantining him.
Corona virus test: Will a new corona test be a 'game changer'?
The extent of corona testing has been a topic of discussion in the country since its inception.
A team of scientists has developed an important and inexpensive test to speed up testing.
This new corona test is based on a genetic editing technology known as Crisper.
Feluda can detect corona infection within an hour, and the cost is estimated at around Rs 500 crore, scientists say.
Feluda is being manufactured by Tata Company.
This is a very simple, easy, reliable and reasonably priced test, Professor K Vijay Raghavan, the Government of India's chief scientific adviser, told the BBC.
Work on the 'Feluda' test is underway at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) in Delhi.
The sensitivity of this new test was found to be 96 percent and the specificity 98 percent.
This means that the first scale (sensitivity) does not lead to 'false negative', while the second scale (specificity) does not lead to 'false positive'.
The number of corona patients in the country has crossed six million.
Initially the speed of testing was low but now more than one lakh tests are being done daily from more than 1200 labs across the country.
The first of these tests is the polymerase chain action or PCR swab test.
The incidence of positive and false negative conclusions is relatively low.
Antigen tests are cheaper than PCR.
Although the number of tests in India has increased, it is still not enough, says Dr. Krishna Kumar, a researcher on global health and health policies.
People still have to wait a long time and the availability of test kits is not enough, he said.
The 'Feluda' test can be an alternative to the antigen test, said Dr. Bhan thinks.
The new test is as reliable as PCR and takes less time.
Sample collection for 'Feluda' test will be done in the same way as PCR test.
In PCR test, the sample is sent to an accredited laboratory.
Crispr is used in the new Feluda test.
According to researchers, genetic editing is done in the same way as in a Word file.
When Crisper technology is used in tests to diagnose infections such as Feluda, the technology identifies the genes that carry the Novel Corona virus and concludes on paper.
If two blue lines appear on the paper, the test is positive, if one blue line appears, the test is negative.
We have to do our best to increase the limited number of tests.
Considering the stages of testing, the test based on Crisper will be the 'third wave'.
We need to do our best to increase the number of tests.
Many companies and research institutes in the US and UK are producing such paper strips. 
"We are trying to develop a test that does not rely on machines and maximum manpower.
"India has an opportunity to show how important this test can be, because India has a large population and this test has been developed only when there is a need to increase the number of tests," he said.
"If this test is effective, it could be beneficial for many countries in the world," he said.
The vaccine is important to prevent coronavirus outbreaks, but accurate and reliable tests are also needed to streamline everything. 
Corona virus strain: New strain of corona virus is spreading in South Africa
The discovery of a new strain of corona virus in Britain has raised concerns around the world.
Two new cases of the corona virus, found in South Africa, have also been found in Britain.
At the press conference, Matt Hancock said, "The two infected people who were infected with the new strain of corona virus in Britain came in contact with some people from South Africa a few days ago."
He added: "The potential for new strains of the virus to be transmitted is high and therefore the discovery of a new strain of the virus is worrisome.
Britain has since temporarily suspended air traffic from South Africa.
The discovery of a new strain of the corona virus in Britain has raised concerns around the world.
Dr. of Public Health England. Susan Hopkins says, "The new strain of the corona virus found in South Africa is very different from the strain we found in Britain.
Both types of the corona virus appear to be spreading rapidly.
The spread of the new strain in South Africa will also be brought under control and the imminent vaccine will be effective on both strains, he said.
There is no evidence at the moment that the vaccine will be effective on new strains.
Explaining this, she said, "When a new virus enters the body, the vaccine works to build the immune system to fight against it.
Corona virus: Corona's new strain reaches many European countries, the threat increased
Several European countries have reported new and more contagious strains of the corona virus.
Now Spain, Sweden and Switzerland have also said that a new strain has been found in their country through travelers from Britain.
Many countries have suspended air travel to Britain following reports of a new strain of the corona virus.
Three relatives of a man returning from Britain were found infected with the corona virus in the Spanish capital, Madrid, on Thursday (December 24th).
One-fourth of the infected patients are from returnees from the UK.
In addition, three new suspected patients have been identified.
Patients were also found in France, Switzerland, Spain and Sweden
France first reported on Saturday (December 26) that a man returning from Britain had contracted a new species of corona.
France cut off traffic between Britain and Britain after learning of a new strain of the virus.
The country's borders were opened to European citizens on Wednesday, December 23.
In addition to Spain and France, three new species of infected patients were found in Switzerland.
Switzerland was the only country to keep its borders open for foreign tourists on the eve of Christmas.
A Swedish tourism company also reported a patient.
In addition, people in Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Australia have been diagnosed with new strains of the corona virus.
In Japan, too, five Japanese nationals returning from Britain were found to be corona positive.
The new strain of corona virus was first identified in London, southeastern Britain and eastern Britain.
According to the UK's Office for Statistics, "Currently two-thirds of the country's corona-positive patients may be infected with the new species.
These three things about the corona have created an atmosphere of concern in the world.
A new strain of the corona virus is spreading rapidly.
The changes in the area affecting human cells in the virus.
Laboratories have shown that these mutations increase the virus's ability to infect human cells.
According to the BBC's health and science correspondent James Gallagher, all of these factors could cause Corona's new strain to spread more rapidly.
However, in the current context, experts believe that vaccines being developed around the world may also have an effect on this species.
Restrictions on travel to Britain from many countries
Meanwhile, more than 40 countries have imposed restrictions on flights from Britain.
So, on Saturday (December 26), Japan made a similar decision.
Apart from Britain, a new strain of corona is said to have been found in South Africa.
According to scientists in South Africa, this new strain of corona virus is spreading to young and healthy people.
New strain of corona virus 'super spreader' spreads 70 per cent faster - Policy Commission
Concerns have been raised again that the virus has changed as the number of coronaviruses in India has been declining.
The rate of transmission of this new type of corona virus is enormous.
However, not a single person infected with the new strain of the corona virus has been found in India so far. K. Paul has said.
Each virus changes itself.
According to the Union Ministry of Health, the number of active coronaviruses in India has come down to less than 3 lakh.
Speaking at the press conference, Dr. V. K. Paul said: "We are in a good position and we need to keep up the pace.
He added: "After talking to researchers in the UK, we found that changes in the virus have greatly increased their ability to infect.
Although there have been some changes in the corona virus, it has not increased the severity of the disease.
A total of 17 mutations have been reported in the new strain of the virus found in the UK.
Talking about the steps taken by the central government after the new strain of corona virus came to light, Dr. V. K. "The government is paying close attention to this.
Airlines in the UK are completely closed until 31 December.
Travelers arriving in India from the UK are being tracked and their condition is being monitored.
Will the corona vaccine be affected?
Will the altered form of the corona virus have any effect on the corona vaccine?
Speaking about this, Dr. "The new strain of Covid-19, currently found in the UK, does not appear to make any difference to vaccine effectiveness," Paul said.
From the discussions we have had with researchers in the UK, our colleagues at the World Health Organization and our study, we can say that there is no need to panic.
However, given the increased potential to infect new strains of the corona virus, people need to be more vigilant and strictly follow the rules of frequent hand washing, observing social distance, wearing masks, keeping doors and windows open and avoiding crowded places, he said. .
No need to panic about the new strain of corona virus - WHO
Restrictions have been placed on air travel in the UK.
The new strain of the corona virus has caused concern in Europe.
The suspension on the flight will quarantine passengers arriving from the UK
The European Union, as well as many countries, are considering suspending transport links to the UK as the altered corona virus poses a growing risk of infection in the UK.
Germany, France and Italy have suspended flights to and from the UK.
Canada has also decided to suspend flights to the UK.
India has also canceled all flights to and from the UK by 31 December 2020.
The altered form of the corona virus is more susceptible to infection.
There is no concrete evidence of how the virus responds to this altered form of vaccines.
This changed form of the corona virus is getting out of hand, said Matt Hancock, the UK's health secretary.
Patients infected with this altered structure have also been found in Denmark, the Netherlands, and Italy.
The manner in which flights to and from the UK have been suspended suggests the risk of the virus is high, said Gavin Lee, the BBC's Brussels correspondent.
The European Union's drug regulatory body Pfizer Bioentech has signs that it will allow the use of the vaccine in 27 states.
A meeting of The European Medicines Agency has been called for a week.
If the use of the vaccine gets the green light at this meeting, the distribution of the vaccine may start in some states.
France has suspended transportation to the UK.
Denmark has suspended flights to the UK, citing the threat of an altered form of the corona virus.
The Netherlands has decided to suspend all passenger traffic through the UK.
Ireland has banned flights from the UK for at least 48 hours.
Germany has banned flights from the UK.
Italy has cut off flights to the UK until January 6.
Turkey and Switzerland have also banned flights from the UK.
Austria has decided to close flights from the UK from Monday.
Kuwait has imposed restrictions on flights to the UK, including Hong Kong, Israel, Iran, Croatia, Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Morocco.
Saudi Arabia has suspended all international flights for a week.
The modified corona virus was first detected in September.

Corona virus: One out of every 10 people in the world is infected - WHO
1 in 10 people in the world may be infected with corona: WHOPHOTO SOURCE,ROBIN UTRECHT / SOPA IMAGES / LIGHTROCKET VIA GETTY IM
The World Health Organization estimates that one in 10 people in the world is infected with the corona virus.
So far, more than 3.5 million people in more than 150 countries around the world have been infected with the corona virus. 
Experts have long said that the actual number is much higher than the number of reported cases of infection
The meeting, which took place at the WHO headquarters in Geneva, discussed how to eradicate this global pandemic from countries around the world.
The first case of coronavirus infection was reported in Wuhan, China. 
A second wave of epidemics erupted in some countries after restrictions were lifted to prevent a global outbreak. 
Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergency Program, estimates that 10 percent of the world's population has been infected so far. 
But that means a large group around the world is in danger.
The virus has affected different countries around the world and everyone should come together to fight the global epidemic, said Tedros Adenhom Gibraeus, director general of the World Health Organization.
He said: "Although all countries are infected with the virus, we need to keep in mind that the outbreak is more severe in some places and less so in some places.
The virus has killed more than 1 million people so far, according to Johns Hopkins University.
Corona update
US President Donald Trump spent the weekend in hospital after testing positive for corona.
Doctors treating Trump have said that he will no longer be treated for Covid 19 at the White House.
The United States has the highest number of coronavirus patients of any country in the world.
Bars in the French capital, Paris, have been closed since Tuesday to curb the growing number of coronavirus cases.
A total of 3,902 new cases of the corona virus were reported in Iran on Monday, with 235 deaths reported.
The Spanish capital, Madrid, has been locked down for the second time due to increasing cases of corona.
Considered one of the best airports in the world, Singapore's Changi Airport has issued a warning about future air travel.
Manmohan Singh's advice to Narendra Modi
Given the growing prevalence of corona in India, former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh has sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi giving him 5 pieces of advice to fight the Corona.
Many states in India are facing shortage of health facilities like hospital beds, oxygen facilities etc.
Dr. The letter, written by Manmohan Singh, mainly focuses on the issue of vaccination.
Over the past year, many parents have not seen their children living in other cities, grandchildren have not seen their grandchildren, teachers have not seen their children at school, many have lost their lives and millions have been plunged back into poverty, he said.
On the one hand, while expressing concern in the country, Dr. Manmohan Singh further said, "I want to give some suggestions to fight this health crisis."
Dr. Dr. Rasa c gave these 5 tips?
1) How to plan vaccines ?
The central government should disclose how many doses have been ordered from different vaccine companies and how many vaccines have been approved for delivery for the next six months.
If you want to vaccinate a certain number of people in the future, you should already have a number of vaccine doses.
2) Coordination between Central Government and State Government
The government should indicate how the potential supply of vaccines will be distributed among the states according to a transparent formula.
The central government can set aside 10 per cent for vaccines in case of emergency, but in addition, the states should be made clear so that they can plan accordingly.
3) Explain the definition of frontline workers
States should be given some concessions so that they can create a category of frontline workers.
4) A licensing provision should be applied
In the last few decades, India has emerged as the largest vaccine producer.
Vaccine
This will enable them to increase production facilities.
5) Vaccines should be imported
Due to limited domestic supplies, imports of vaccines approved by the European Medical Agency or USFDA should be permitted.
We are facing an unprecedented emergency situation.
Remdesivir: Will not tolerate pressure on police, Valse Patil warns Fadnavis
The supply of Remedesivir injection to Maharashtra is currently heating up politics.
Noting that Devendra Fadnavis visited the BKC police station yesterday, Home Minister Walse Patil said that if pressure was put on the police, it would not be tolerated. Replying to him, Devendra Fadnavis said that it is inappropriate to do politics at present.
What happened yesterday
Mumbai Police has received information that Daman-based Bruck Pharma has a stock of 60,000 remediesvir.
Then on Saturday (April 17), Mumbai police suddenly arrested Rajesh Dokania, owner of Brooke Pharma Company.
Home Minister Dilip Walse Patil said that it was not appropriate to put pressure on the police and such things would not be tolerated in the future.
Police have received information that about 50,000 Remedesivirs are coming to Mumbai.
Walse Patil further said, "If the police wanted to investigate a case, they could have called anyone.
Speaking to the media on the occasion, Fadnavis said, "It is unfortunate, serious and worrisome that the Maharashtra government has suddenly arrested a Brooke Pharma official while we are trying our best to get Remedesivir to Maharashtra.
It's completely incomprehensible that a minister's OSD calls in the afternoon and threatens and asks how you can give Remedesivir at the behest of the opposition, and in the evening 10 policemen arrest him.
Fadnavis further said, "It is very serious if politics is taking place at such a dirty level when the Union Minister himself told the company to give more and more remedivisers to Maharashtra while taking permission from Maharashtra and Daman."
' A of the two opposition leaders to save the businessman? '
Responding to Fadnavis' allegations, Minorities Minister Nawab Malik said, "After the ban on export of remedesivir, some companies came to the Maharashtra government to allow us to sell.
A company called Brooke Pharma and its owner Rajesh Dokania were also approached by Food and Drug Administration Minister Dr. Rajendra Shingane met with Leader of Opposition Praveen Darekar.
Permission was sought from two companies, BDR and Brooke Pharma, and it was granted to them last night.
Opposition leaders Devendra Fadnavis, Praveen Darekar and Prasad Lad reached the police station at 11.30 pm.
We will bring it and distribute it in the state
What do the police say?
There is a shortage of remedicavir and it is known to cause black market.
Mumbai Police acted in good faith, the director was called for questioning.
Allegations from Remedesivir
NCP spokesperson and minister Nawab Malik on Saturday (April 17) accused the central government of ordering companies not to give Remedesivir to Maharashtra.
He said, "When the Maharashtra government asked about 16 exporting companies about Remedesivir, they got shocking information.
In today's scenario, the Maharashtra government will have no choice but to confiscate the stock of remedicivir from these companies and deliver it to the needy, Malik said.
Maharashtra BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhyay has refuted Malik's allegations.
Keshav Upadhyay said, "Instead of making such baseless allegations, Nawab Malik should give evidence if he has any, otherwise he should apologize.
Is the allegation made by Nawab Malik the role of the Maharashtra government?
BJP leader and Union Minister Piyush Goyal has tweeted that Maharashtra is suffering from the effects of inefficient and corrupt government in the state.
He wrote in his tweet, "Maharashtra is getting all the help it needs from the Center.
I am saddened to see Uddhav Thackeray playing the game of oxygen.
Maharashtra Covid Task Force issues letter regarding Ramdesivir
Maharashtra Covid Task Force has issued a letter regarding the use of Remedesivir.
Ramdesivir has received emergency permission for use against Covid-19.
Studies have shown that the use of Ramdesivir reduces the number of days of hospitalization due to its use.
Ramdesivir should be given exclusively to hospitalized patients with moderate to severe illness and on oxygen for five days.
Ramdesivir should not be used unnecessarily in the first 9-10 days of illness.
Corona: What is the status of Corona in the arenas participating in Kumbh Mela?
On the one hand, there are rumors that Niranjan Akhada will be out of the Kumbh Mela and on the other hand, Hari Giri, the General Secretary of the Akhada Parishad, has denied the news.
According to PTI, Niranjan Akhada secretary Ravinder Puri said that the main bath on the eve of Sankranti on April 14 has been completed.
Mahamandleshwar Swami Kapil Dev of Mahanirvani Akhada has passed away.
Hari Giri, on the other hand, told the BBC that the news that Niranjani Akhada was going out of Kumbh Mela was completely wrong.
He said, "There are so many sadhus here.
Hari Giri said that the meeting will consider the situation in which arena.
According to reports, Akhada Parishad president Mahant Narendra Giri is in hospital due to covid.
Additional Kumbh Mela Officer Ramji Sharan Sharma confirmed and welcomed the news that Niranjani Akhada was going out of Kumbh Mela.
I hope the rest of the arenas will gradually move out of the Kumbh Mela, Sharma said.
According to Ramji Sharan Sharma, the decision of Niranjani Akhada will not affect the Kumbh Mela system.
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post.
The increasing prevalence of corona in Aquarius is a cause for concern.
Chief Medical Officer of Haridwar Dr. S.K. According to Jha, 1664 covid positive patients were found in the Kumbh Mela area between April 10 and 14.
Dr. According to Jha, the positivity rate in Aquarius is 0.29 per cent.
The monks we spoke to claim that there is no corona infection in their arena.
According to Lakshmi Narayan Tripathi of Kinnar Akhada, her akhada has stopped meeting people as a security measure.
Outsiders are not allowed to come where we are, he said.
However, Hathayogi Baba, who is associated with Digambar akhada, said that corona was spreading rapidly in the akhada.

Corona: How did the outbreak of corona occur in a village famous for its sex and fun?
Cape D'Agade in France is a traditional summer vacation destination for nature lovers and thousands of swingers in Europe.
France is once again witnessing a large increase in the number of coronaviruses.
It is home to one of the largest nature resorts in Europe.
As many as 30% of the 800 tourists tested corona by these mobile testing units tested positive.
'We all know why we're here'
There is a big resort called 'village naturiste' not far from the main city.
Of course not all nature lovers are swingers.
A swinger couple told the BBC: "Everyone here is very close to each other all day and of course naked."
We all know why we're here.
About 45,000 tourists visit here every day in summer.
However, this situation predates Covid.
How did the corona erupt?
At the end of August, two employees of 'Village Naturiste' were found to be covid positive.
The hotel owner has admitted that he had organized a party on the terrace of a hotel here.
David Masella, manager of Village Naturiste, told the BBC: "We were hit twice.
Most of these tourists did not return this year due to the virus infection.
One thing you should note is that our village has ten thousand campsite pitches.
Local administration response
The French health administration says there are four times as many cases in Cape de-Agade than in the surrounding area.
However, the staff here said that none of them needed to be admitted to the hospital immediately.
In Cape D'Agde, as in the rest of the world, it is mandatory to wear a face mask in every city and town.
I met two couples in the evening. They live here.
The couple, who are in their forties, met a few years ago at a swingers' club in Bordeaux, France.
Two employees of the hotel have contracted corona.
The village turned from a magic location into a tragic location overnight.
'More young people at risk'
Allen and his wife were sitting in front of me.
Both have crossed for ages. He says it is wrong to blame any one village.
At our age, of course, we have to be careful about where we go, who we come in contact with.
Many clubs and bars where physical contact was more prevalent were immediately shut down as corona infections became more prevalent.
Vicky Beach Resort was also closed.
Le Glamor Nightclub is also very popular among tourists.
The closure of these parties caused a lot of frustration.
'No one is in the mood to have fun'
Philip Barre has been running a clothing store for the past 30 years.
Speaking to the BBC, Philip said: "We are very important to the local economy.
There are only 5,000 people here today.
Although Philip says that the swingers I met said that although the corona erupted, the swingers activity did not stop completely.
This suffix also comes when you go to the beach.
Many of these are over the age of fifty. However, the desire to look attractive has not diminished.
In the evenings, many are seen dressed in sexy outfits at the open-air bar on the beach.
The crowd is much smaller than before.
The administration has also suggested that those who are thinking of returning home should return only after undergoing a covid test.
When will the corona vaccine arrive?
A patient infected with the corona was first found in Wuhan, China, in December last year.
It then began to spread to other parts of the world.
So far in nine months, the corona virus has crossed the 2.66 million mark.
The death toll from the virus has risen to more than 8.75 million.
In August, Russia announced the discovery of a vaccine against Kovid-19.
He has named this vaccine 'Sputnik V'.
But coronavirus vaccines are being developed in many countries around the world.
Another 142 companies are developing vaccines, according to the World Health Organization .
According to Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the World Health Organization, the vaccine, developed by Oxford University, is being manufactured by AstraZeneca.
The BBC's health and science correspondent James Gallagher says "the vaccine for the corona virus will be available by mid-2021 .
News of the coronavirus vaccine has created a ray of hope in the minds of ordinary citizens, including scientists .
This question has made many people nervous.
AstraZeneca vaccine
The BBC spoke to AstraZeneca, a company that produces vaccines manufactured by Oxford University.
We will try to make the vaccine available at a lower cost.
Last month, the head of the company in Mexico said, "In Latin America, a single dose of vaccine can cost less than four dollars.
The Serum Institute , which is the largest producer of the vaccine in India , said the price of the vaccine for India as well as other developing countries could be around or Rs 220.
Similarly, in Europe , it can cost up to two and a half euros , according to the Italian Ministry of Health.
Australia also signed an agreement with AstraZeneca for the corona vaccine in August.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said it is unclear how much the corona vaccine will be given to all Australians.
Vaccine by Sanofi Pasteur
In France, the vaccine can cost up to 10 euros per dose (about 900 rupees), said Olivier Bogilot, head of the Sanofi company, on Saturday.
Pharmaceutical manufacturers and government agencies around the world are working to develop vaccines to combat corona.
AstraZeneca is considered a major competitor to Sanofi.
Speaking about the low cost of the AstraZeneca vaccine, Bogilot says, "It matters what resources you use.
Vaccine from Cyanoform, a Chinese company
Cyanoform, a Chinese company, is also developing the vaccine, its head Liu Jingzhen said last month.
When the vaccine became available in the market, two doses of it could cost less than one thousand Chinese yuan (ten thousand rupees), he had said.
But experts say health workers and students should be vaccinated for free.
According to Chinese medical officials, if the vaccine is included in the national vaccination campaign, the vaccine could be obtained at government expense.
Liu, currently the head of the company, has taken two doses of the vaccine.
Modern vaccine
The Modernna company in Cambridge is also trying to make vaccines.
The vaccine can be given to some people at a cost of ते 33 to37 in the wake of the Corona outbreak, Modern said.
The price of the vaccine could be kept as low as possible, said CEO Stephen Bansel.
The current times are difficult and everyone should get this vaccine.
Pfizer vaccine
In July this year, the US government signed a 1.97 billion deal with Pfizer and Bioentech for the corona vaccine.
According to a report published in FirePharma , Pfizer and Biantech are developing an MRNA-based corona vaccine.
Anyone will need two initial doses of vaccine and one booster dose.
Corona-era organic waste endangers your health?
The problem of bio-medical waste generated across the state during the period of Covid-19 is likely to become very serious.
PPE kits, masks, goggles and other items are used daily to treat patients in the fight against corona virus.
Exposure to these substances also increases the risk of contracting the disease.
As a result, the Corona crisis has seen an increase in the number of biomedical wastes generated in the state by thousands of kilos.
Biological waste situation in the state
The state announced a lockdown in March.
There has been a significant increase in the amount of organic waste generated in the state since the corona.
According to the State Pollution Control Board, the state used to generate 62.3 tonnes (62,300 kg) of organic waste per day before Covid-19, while the number of organic waste reached 90.6 tonnes (90,600 kg) during the Corona period.
Organic waste generation increased by 45 percent
Increased organic waste generation in lockdown ...
10 percent (6.5 tons) in Lockdown 1
15 percent (10 tons) in Lockdown 2
30 (20 tons) in Lockdown 3
In Lockdown 4, organic waste generation increased by 45 percent
(Source-State Pollution Control Board Report)
The disposal of biological medical waste caused by Covid-19 is of utmost importance for the municipalities and districts in the years to come, the report said.
The problem of organic waste in Mumbai
In Mumbai too, the number of organic wastes has suddenly increased during the Corona period.
Ashok Yamagar, chief engineer of the solid waste management department, told the BBC:
Information on Covid-19 organic waste in Mumbai
In March, an average of 286 kg of organic waste was collected daily
In April, the quantity increased to 3750 kg
In May, an average of 7900 kg of organic waste was generated per day
More than 10,000 kg of organic waste was generated per day in June
More than 12,000 kg of organic waste generated in July
So, on September 13, 11,719 kg of organic waste was collected.

Biological medical waste poses a threat to public health
Mumbai Municipal Corporation has given the responsibility of disposal of bio-waste generated in Mumbai to a private company based in Govandi.
The company is located in a densely populated area.
Saif Alam, who is a lawyer by profession in Govandi area, is suffering from allergic bronchitis.
Saif says, We have issued a legal notice to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board.
"All of Mumbai's biomedical waste is brought to this place for disposal.
Why doesn't the corporation set up more than one plant for disposal of medical waste?
When asked about the pollution allegations against the company, Ashok Yamagar, the chief engineer of the corporation, refrained from giving a direct answer.
The company can dispose of up to 24 metric tonnes of waste. It is a common treatment facility center.
The issue came up in the rainy session
The Samajwadi Party had raised the issue of biomedical waste in the Assembly during the two-day monsoon session in September.
Pollution has reduced people's life expectancy from 60 to 39.
The situation of bio-medical waste in Kolhapur is also critical.
Dilip Desai, a social worker from Kolhapur, said, "The biomedical waste disposal plant in the city is sometimes closed and sometimes operational.
The State Pollution Control Board has issued a show cause notice to the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation.
The challenge of organic waste disposal
According to the State Pollution Board, in 2019, 62.13 metric tons of organic waste was disposed of per day.
Challenges Facing Organic Waste Disposal
Not getting trained people to work
Improper segregation of waste
PPE kits reduce the capacity of the machine
Sunil Dandwate, vice-president of the All India Biomedical Waste Association, said, Normally, machines are designed for a specific type of waste.
The issue of transportation is also important.
Central Government Information on Organic Waste
In August, Union Health Minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha that the country generated 169 tonnes of organic waste per day during the Covid-19 period.
Informing the Rajya Sabha, Health Minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey said, "According to the Central Pollution Control Board, there have been some complaints about improper disposal of organic waste.
At the same time, there have been complaints of improper segregation of items in coronary artery treatment centers and hospitals.
An app has been developed to monitor the proper disposal of bio-waste generated by covid.
Expert opinion
Speaking on the issue of biological medical waste, Dr. RNisarg of the social organization working on the topic of waste management.
Therefore, along with Covid-19, the waste generated in the hospital will also increase.
"PPE kits are in high demand in medical waste generated by Covid-19.
Proper segregation of covid and routine waste should be done.
What do the workers say about the Union Minister's statement on 'migration due to fake news'?
Union Home Minister Nityanand Rai had said in the Lok Sabha on September 15 that fake news came after the lockdown and thousands of workers marched to their homes due to fears created by the fake news.
After the lockdown, thousands of migrant workers fled their homes.
Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai said, "Fear spread over the fake news about the lockdown period, which led to a mass exodus of migrant workers.
However, in times of unavoidable lockdown, the central government was vigilant to ensure that no one was deprived of basic necessities like food, drinking water, health care and took necessary steps to meet these needs. "
The BBC spoke to the migrant workers after the central government made the statement in Parliament.
What do migrant workers have to say?
The migration of workers had already started in India a few days before the lockdown.
Before the lockdown, only a couple of laborers were seen on the streets carrying their belongings and children.
Even after the reversal of June and July, many people were seen traveling in trucks or other similar large vehicles in an inhumane manner.
Representatives of the BBC walked with many of these workers to convey their grievances to readers.
After the statement of Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai, some of these workers once again explained why they left the city and returned to their village.
Pooja says, "There was nothing left to eat in my room.
Pooja Kumari, who lives in Delhi with her husband, will never be able to forget what she suffered during the lockdown.
We said okay. After that, no grain was received.
I mean, I was not allowed to go for dinner.
There was nothing in the room to eat.
We told them why go back to the room?
After that, Pooja Kumari and her husband returned to their home in Jharkhand after overcoming many difficulties by the special train started at that time.
Vimala Devi has a similar story.
She says, "We left there (Delhi) when we didn't have any work.
There was no way to get home.
However, some of the laborers walking home are unhappy with the media and the system.
Manoj Singh, who left Delhi on foot with Ranveer Singh, who died on foot, is not ready to talk about it.
Sittu Kumar, who had experienced migration clicks, had gone to Delhi from Bihar in search of work a few days before the lockdown.
He even got a job in Delhi. However, just two days after the work began, the lockdown began.
Sittu Kumar says, "The work was stopped there.
Only two days worked and the lockdown started.
These are the stories of a handful of migrant laborers who returned to their hometowns after losing their jobs and lacking food and water.
Returning to Delhi, Salman says, "I used to live in Bawana.
We had nothing to eat or drink when we left.
Corona Maharashtra: Are ventilators dusting in many places in the state?
The effect of having ventilators, but not in use, is serious.
He adds, "This means you can only take care of 2 patients.
Herschel himself was cowardly positive and was also admitted for some time.
It was reported that 25 ventilators were lying unused in Kovid Center in Chandwad taluka of Nashik district.
In July, it was found that the ventilators provided by an organization in Pune were not being used.
Around the same time, the BJP had alleged that 400 ventilators provided by the PM Care Fund were lying in a Mumbai hospital .
While replying to this, Mumbai Municipal Corporation Mayor Kishori Pednekar had denied the allegation that 'ventilators are eating dust'.
This was followed by reports of similar incidents in Nanded .
But the latest incident is that 25 ventilators provided by PM Care Fund are lying unused in Chandwad taluka sub-district hospital in Nashik district this week.
"A few days ago, when I visited the hospital, I noticed that 25 ventilators were literally eating away at the dust.
Of course, local health officials, doctors and medical staff are constantly working, but they say it is an administrative mistake.
The de-humidifier required for the ventilator was not here, there is a shortage of manpower.
What about the lives of ordinary people?
This is the subject of Herschel's attention. "I was admitted.
If the oxygen saturation of the covid patient admitted in the taluka hospital goes below 75-80, they are immediately referred to the district hospital.
In all this, the patient's important time is wasted.
In such a situation, patients are often frightened and assume that they will not read, says Herschel.
Hershel says, "When I was admitted, there was a householder next to me.
And he died the next evening after being taken to Nashik.
The population of Chandwad taluka is around two and a half lakh.
Nowadays 10-12 positive patients are found there every day while one case has to be referred to Nashik District Hospital as critical every day.
Even if they are taken to a district location, there is no guarantee that they will get a bed.
Nashik district has received about 200 ventilators in the last few months through PM Care Fund and CSR Activities.
Misunderstandings of the people
Corona proliferation in India has accelerated over the past few weeks, with the number of patients in rural areas increasing rapidly.
People think that testing in government hospitals will be positive and we will get caught in that cycle.
PM Care Fund
Most of the leaders who allege that the ventilators are lying are from the BJP and they say that these ventilators were provided from the PM Care Fund.
Information about PM Care Fund should be given on the website.
Both the state government relief fund and the PM care fund are discriminated against.
However, the most important question is whether the common man is not involved in the political and administrative differences between the state and central governments.
Corona Oxygen: Is India's situation with Corona getting worse than before?
Ankit Sethia was wandering around a 50-bed hospital in Bhiwandi near Mumbai on Friday night, anxiously waiting for oxygen.
Ankit Sethia's SS Hospital and Research Center had only two of the four oxygen cylinders filled.
The hospital has 44 out of 50 beds.
As the patient grows, the small oxygen tank runs out in six hours.
Ankit always buys oxygen from those who are not currently supplied.
He made overnight inquiries at about 10 suppliers and four hospitals in and around Mumbai.
Finally, at two in the morning, they learned that 20 large oxygen cylinders were available at a hospital. But the hospital was 30 kilometers long.
Since there was no vehicle available to bring oxygen, they sent an ambulance for the job.
All the cylinders were brought from that place in five rounds.
Now four employees have been assigned to search for the oxygen cylinder and make it available immediately.
Ankit said on Sunday, "Now I have oxygen for the next 12 hours.
According to the World Health Organization, 15 percent of patients infected with corona need oxygen for artificial respiration.
Some patients come in without any complaints related to breathing.
Oxygen production is done in 500 factories in the country.
Factories produce liquid oxygen and fill it in a tank.
Steel and aluminum cylinders are also used in some hospitals.
People are now returning to work after the country's lockdown was lifted.
So far, 5 million people have been infected with the corona in India, which ranks second in terms of the number of patients.
In the last one week alone, India has seen an increase of six lakh patients.
In such a situation, the demand for oxygen will increase, which is natural.
Hospitals and care centers are using 2,700 tonnes of oxygen this month.
This information has been obtained from the All India Industrial Gas Manufacturers Association.
The highest number of patients in the country are from Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.
The question of life and death versus stomach
At present in India, there is a situation of life and death versus water.
According to Saket Tikku, president of the Manufacturers Association, "Currently 45 per cent of oxygen is being used for industry and 55 per cent for hospitals.
If you reduce the supply in the factory, the industry will suffer.
Most of the oxygen factories in India are located near cities as well as large villages.
Nothing has been achieved even by controlling the price of oxygen.
There is no solution even after government intervention
Saket Tikku says, "The government has set a limit on the price of oxygen cylinders, but not of liquid oxygen.
So far, 82,000 patients have died of corona in India.
Last week, four corona patients died in Madhya Pradesh due to lack of oxygen.
The death toll of 70 children in Uttar Pradesh in August 2017 is still fresh.
Oxygen is depleted in Madhya Pradesh.
Piyush Bhatt, who has been running the refilling company for five years, says, "The demand for oxygen cylinders in the district has quadrupled since last month."
Fear of a situation similar to Italy
Piyush says, "We could not get the supply as the truck was stopped at the state border.
Even on Monday, Piyush was waiting for the supply.
Dr. of Glory Hospital in Chhindwara.
The 960-bed AIIMS hospital in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, is slowly filling up.
We are providing oxygen from various places by doing wire exercises, said N.S. R. Bishnoi said.
So, Bhiwandi Ankit Sethia is also getting calls from others for oxygen.
Five patients would have died if they had not received the cylinder in half an hour, he says.
Will everything be fine overnight with the corona vaccine?
If you think that everything will be fine with the corona vaccine, you may be wrong.
The vaccine is currently being looked at in such a way that all coronary outbreaks will end immediately.
Scientists say it could take at least a year for the vaccine to reach people.
Vaccine trials are currently underway in 200 locations around the world.
Dr. of the National Heart and Lung Institute of Imperial College London.
Many, including scientific advisers to the UK government, hope that the vaccine will be ready by the end of this year and that it will be heavily tested.
Assuming the vaccine is ready, it doesn't mean everyone will be vaccinated in a month.
It is unthinkable that all will be well until March.
Of course, some experimental methods are also being used.
What are the difficulties along the way?
Raw materials are needed to make the vaccine.
Pvt. According to Shah, "Corona needs to work ten times faster than it does every year to eradicate the common flu.
Preliminary tests of some of the vaccines showed that they boosted the immune system.
Many questions remain unanswered
We don't really know when the vaccine will be made.
He goes on to say, "If this were possible, things would get better as soon as possible.
Also, some questions remain unanswered regarding vaccines
Will a single shot of vaccine be enough or will another booster dose be needed?
Will it be equally effective on older people?
Speaking about this, Dr. of the University of Bath.
He said that in order to get all the information about vaccination, a 'vaccine passport' would have to be prepared for the people coming and going in the country.
He says there has also been a rise in tensions over the corona vaccine.
Many such questions remain unresolved.
Is the spread of Corona virus slowing down in India?
After 65 lakh corona cases and 1 lakh deaths, is the spread of corona virus slowing down in India?
In India, an average of 64,000 coronaviruses are found every day this month.
Earlier in September alone, there were an average of 93,000 cases per day.
There should be 70,000 tests every day in August.
Looking at these statistics, it seems that the number of corona victims is decreasing.
There are positive signs that the number of coronaries is declining.
He says that increasing the number of tests and decreasing the number of patients is not enough to reach any conclusion.
They are quick and effective. However, their credibility is also low.
In contrast, the RT-PCR test is more reliable.
Speaking to the BBC, virologist Dr. Shahid Jalil said, "It is difficult to say whether the number of coronaviruses is declining due to erroneous results of rapid testing and indeed the incidence of infection is declining."
According to him, only if the government provides statistics on the total number of PCR tests and how many rapid tests have been done, can it be said for sure.
The President of Public Health Foundation of India, Dr. According to Srinath Reddy, on-demand testing has started in India.
A professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of Michigan, Dr. According to Bhramar Mukherjee, 12 to 13 crore people in India have been infected with the corona virus so far. T
Various antigen tests in India have so far shown that 90 million people have been infected with the corona.
Dr. Mukherjee says, "Compared to the spread of the virus, there is still a lot of forest left to spread.
But how do you know if the corona virus has slowed down in India?
Dr. According to Reddy, this can be estimated by getting death statistics.
Although the number of coronaviruses appears to be declining, the 7-day moving average of deaths indicates that the spread of the virus is declining.
Adam Kacharsky, a scientist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says that any global health crisis has four stages - spark, growth, peak and decline.
In the UK, when the swine flu outbreak hit in 2009, it increased in the summer, with its peak in July.
Let's take the example of countries with a large number of Kovid-19 patients - USA, UK, Russia and France.
Dr. Mukherjee says that while the picture is reassuring, it is "fleeting and short-lived".
He says, "These (declining numbers of patients) are not a sign that the disease is getting under control or a matter of consolation.
So tie one thing - use a mask, wash your hands constantly and stay away from crowded places.
Corona: Why do experts around the world say that vaccines alone are not enough?
Efforts to find a vaccine on Covid-19 are currently at the level of clinical trials.
There is no point in just finding a vaccine for any disease.
The process of producing vaccines in a factory is very different from the process of making vaccines in a laboratory.
Millions of doses of vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella and even influenza are produced in factories every year.
Developing a new vaccine is a long process.
However, clinical trials of the vaccine began after the outbreak of Ebola.
Experts say that developing a completely new vaccine nationally or globally without compromising the production of existing vaccines is a daunting task.
Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University's Center for Infection and Immunity, says, "We are developing a vaccine on a virus that has never been vaccinated before, never approved. Not used extensively. "
It usually takes 10 years for a vaccine to be developed and reach the masses.
At the heart of this effort is the parallel development process being used by the pharmaceutical industry in times of crisis.
After successfully passing all these stages, it goes for final approval and then the factory starts mass production of vaccine.
In the case of the Covid-19 vaccine, however, many of these stages continue in parallel.
For example, after testing on animals, the exact dose of vaccine to be used for a clinical trial is decided.
Margaret Liu, head of the International Society for Vaccines, said: "We are currently examining the results of tests performed on animals that have already begun clinical trials of the third phase of the vaccine."
Although vaccines have not yet been developed as part of this parallel development process, manufacturing facilities are being set up around the world.
The United States has launched Operation Warp Speed ​​for the production of vaccines.
When any vaccine is produced in a factory, laboratory methods of vaccine preparation are not used.
The same problem occurs when any vaccine is produced in large quantities.
And so even for large-scale production of vaccines, a different process has to be followed.
Dean says, "Even during factory production, there are many stages of trial and error and therefore it takes a long time to reach the stage of getting the right return."
Moreover, no technology for vaccine production has been used so extensively before.
In addition, everyone will need to be given two doses of the vaccine to prevent covid-19.
Taking a single dose of the vaccine can have side effects.
Liu says, "People who have low levels of antibodies are no longer at risk of disease, assuming they don't follow the rules of social distance or the use of masks in public places.
Some vaccines require special equipment for use.
The device is the size of a small electric toothbrush.
Although these devices can be used more than once, they must be produced in sufficient quantities.
Some other items are needed along with the vaccine.
Even for Covid-19 vaccines, these small bottles will have to be mass-produced.
One solution could be a multi-dose vaccine vial that can store more than one dose of vaccine.
Therefore, it is as important to make a vaccine as it is to keep it safe and maintain its quality.
Such low temperatures are usually only possible in laboratories.
To solve this problem of refrigerators, distribution companies like UPS and DHL are opening freezer farms around the world.
Liu says, "Some companies are also developing monitors for vaccine capsules to monitor the temperature.
Also, there is a problem called 'Last Mile Problem' or 'Last Mile Issue'.
We can hope that the most needy will get this vaccine by early 2021.
This is a huge challenge. However, given the unprecedented global collective effort for the Covid-19 vaccine, it remains to be seen whether we will meet this challenge.
Corona Vaccine: After losing a close friend, he took the initiative for testing
Anil Hebber's close friend, who lived in Mumbai in September, died of Covid-19.
Anil Hebber owns a medical device manufacturing company.
However, this was not the only friend Anil Hebber lost due to Covid-19.
I was shocked by his death.
Anil Hebber registered earlier this month for testing in India a vaccine being developed jointly by AstraZeneca and Oxford University.
Efforts are underway to develop a vaccine against a simple cold virus that infects chimpanzees.
Today, research is underway on about 180 Covid-19 vaccines worldwide.
More than 20,000 volunteers have participated in clinical trials of Oxford vaccine in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and India.
The number of corona victims in India is over 70 lakh.
These tests will test whether the vaccine activates the body's immune system against the virus and whether the vaccine has any side effects on the body.
However, it was not easy for Anil Hebber to decide to take part in the test.
His wife, a professor of developmental studies at the College of Social Sciences, did not like the decision.
Not only that, but the worldwide trials were suspended for some time due to the ill health of two volunteers in the UK.
However, Anil Heber insisted on his decision.
At the beginning of October, he called the hospital in Mumbai where the second and third phases of the vaccine were being tested.
The next morning he went to the hospital.
That same night, they received a phone call from the hospital informing them that they could participate in the test.
The next day, the doctor gave them detailed information about how they would pass the test.
Doctors said three of the 55 vaccinated had mild fever.
Heber says, "The whole process was very easy and painless.
Anil Hebber, who took the initiative for vaccine testing, has done a lot of work for corona sufferers throughout the lockdown.
The lockdown began in India in the last week of March.
It was a very frightening situation and the lockdown was implemented in a very wrong way, he says.
Anil Hebber says, "During all this time, I must have driven about 28,000 km in and around Mumbai.
During this time I wandered in the slums.
Anil Hebber has registered his name for the test.
This global health crisis has been a life-changing experience for me.
Corona Women's Health: 29 lakh 50 thousand women in India can have 'unwanted pregnancy'?
Stress on government machinery during the Covid period has affected family planning facilities.
It does not include family planning operations performed by government hospitals.
A teacher couple living in a rural area of ​​Maharashtra had to go through a lot of mental stress in the lockdown.
During the investigation, it was learned that the second month has started in May.
He inquired at a nearby primary health center.
Doctors at the primary health center advised her to go to a government-approved private abortion center.
Many families have secrets about abortion.
'25 thousand loans and interest 18 thousand '
The 21-year-old from a similar but poor family had an unwanted pregnancy.
Women's Health: Why take a loan from a lender for abortion in a private hospital?
She was advised by the primary health center to have an abortion in the fifth month.
The sonography cost more than Rs 5,000.
The nearest primary health center used to check pregnant women on the ninth of every month till February.
Eventually, the woman paid Rs 25,000 to a private hospital for abortion surgery.
Where did you get this amount? When asked, she said, "I took a loan of Rs 25,000 from a lender.
This means that the family will have to pay interest of Rs 18,000 on a loan of Rs 25,000 a year.
The recent heavy rains have also damaged the crop.
Covid's crisis has put a strain on the health care system, putting a strain on the government health system.
These are two representative examples.
Unwanted pregnancy
If this situation continues for a few more days, there will be 18 lakh abortions in India, of which 10 lakh 40 thousand abortions will be unsafe and nearly two thousand mothers may die in pregnancy, according to a report by the Foundation for Reproductive Health Services, India (FRHSI). .
If medical family planning services in India do not resume as before by 2020, women's health will deteriorate, the report said.
Contraceptives will not be available to 2 crore 71 lakh 80 thousand couples in the country and therefore 29 lakh 50 thousand women will have to accept unwanted pregnancies, the organization said.
The institute has analyzed how Covid will affect family planning in India.
Abortion is dangerous and expensive
In India, abortion is allowed within 20 weeks.
Abortion facilities are usually available in the first 12 weeks.
In the current situation, if you want to go to the operating theater to terminate the pregnancy, it is inevitable to test Covid.
According to him, 'the government health system in India was in shambles, it has come to light only because of Kovid.
'Demand for contraceptives increases'
Last year, in the financial year 2019-20, 3 lakh 66 thousand 205 family planning surgeries were performed in Maharashtra.
As a contraceptive, 'Antra' injection facility is provided by the government hospital.
Exactly how many family planning surgeries have been performed in Maharashtra since April 2020 and how many contraceptive devices have been used has not been released yet.
But you can get an idea from the statistics of Osmanabad district.
At the same time, a positive change has taken place.
He also said that women's health rights have been neglected as all the poor and middle income families are dependent on government family planning programs.
It will be important to see the Total Fertility Rate (TFA) in the country in the near future.
What will happen to a woman's right to abortion during Kovid's time and will her life be safe?
Corona: Thousands gather in Bihar as epidemic spreads
Restrictions on coronation are not being observed in Bihar at present.
The video shows people flocking to these meetings of all parties to see their leader.
The participants did not even wear masks.
The Election Commission has made the leaders aware of the rules made against Kovid-19.
Violation of corona safety regulations
Virologist Dr. According to Shahid Jameel, political parties need to be more responsible, they should also make their activists aware.
He said, "Thousands of people seem to be participating in these campaigns.
In Bihar, the BJP and JD (U) are trying to regain power.
A journalist from Bihar says that no one is talking about Corona in the campaign.
He said, "Corona seems to have suddenly disappeared from the state.
The state government has said that 1.5 lakh tests are being conducted every day.
But experts are not convinced.
Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had said that two lakh people are being tested in the state every day.
According to experts, this condition is a risk factor for rapid antigen misinformation.
Pulmonologist Dr. A. Fatehuddin says, "Such violations are unaffordable in Bihar.
He says, "Bihar has a high population density.
The festive season and the weather can also be linked to the spread of the corona.
Dr. Shahid Jameel says, "I am horrified to see such photos of campaign rallies, cold days and the coming festive season.
Dr. "There is a widespread perception among young people that the corona does not have much effect, but we cannot guarantee that young people will not be seriously ill with the virus," says Fatahuddin.
If people in other parts of the country see this crowd, they may feel that the virus is no longer spreading and that the risk is greater.
Corona: Why didn't the gym start?
There were a lot of restrictions on the gym during the Corona period, some places still are.
During the Corona period, most businesses closed due to lockdowns.
Gyms were started in the UK.
The ban on gymnasiums in the UK does not apply to the whole country.
What are the reasons behind closing the gym?
Gymnasiums have been shut down on the one hand to keep the government fit on the other to prevent corona.
Gym users told Newsbeat that the decision to close the gym was incomprehensible.
What does the scripture say?
Jonathan Ball, a professor at the University of Nottingham, is well versed in the virus.
Exercising causes your body to move a lot.
So while exercising, droplets can come out of the sneeze or talk.
Many equipments, objects are contacted while exercising in the gym.
But there is a solution.
The risk of corona infection in the gym can be carefully reduced.
Looking at the data from the Department of Public Health in England, I don't know if the gym centers have become a hotspot for corona.
If there are strict restrictions on the gym, then the government and the scientists should explain the reasons behind the strict restrictions.
The government and the local administration are working hard to prevent overcrowding in places where corona can be transmitted.
So some restrictions may seem unwarranted to citizens.
Economic consequences are seen as less risky in terms of losses.
What do gym drivers say?
I'm shocked, confused, confused by this decision, said trainer Nathan Penman.
We all have strange feelings.
The 28-year-old from Liverpool spoke to Newsbeat after the gym session.
Not everyone will understand why gyms are closing.
Nathan said it is important to use the gym for physical and mental health.
Health and fitness, including physical and mental health, should be a priority for every country.
Therefore, the closure of gyms started by the government sends the wrong message to the society.
Everyone who came to the gym had to follow the rules, Nathan said.
The number of corona patients is increasing in the Nottingham area.
I was eager to go to the gym.
The staff at the gym had taken all measures to prevent corona infection.
However, he said that many gym members were not following the rules.
Many members did not wipe it off after using the equipment in the gym.
I go for swimming to keep my mental health good and not to have negative thoughts in my head.
You have to register for the time before going to our gym.
So Jack has decided to go to the gym at least once.
Corona Vaccine: Why is it necessary for Indians to develop a 'hot vaccine' for corona?
Temperatures reach 50 degrees Celsius in many places in India during summer days.
All vaccines are transported and distributed at temperatures as low as 2 to 8 degrees Celsius.
However, Covid-19 developed a vaccine that does not depend on cold temperatures, does not need to be stored in cold storage, and can be delivered to remote areas at any temperature.
Some researchers in India are trying to develop such a vaccine.
Raghavan Varadarajan is a biophysicist and professor at the Indian Institute of Science.
Pvt. "The vaccine has had good results," says Varadarajan.
The Secretary of the Biotechnology Department of the Center, Dr. "I hope this research will open up new avenues for funding for this vaccine, which does not require a coldstorage chain," says Renu Swaroop.
Vaccines that survive high temperatures are rare.
Vaccines for the three diseases of the world, namely meningitis, human paleomavirus (HPV) and cholera, are used at temperatures as high as 40 degrees Celsius.
These vaccines are delivered immediately even in remote areas, which greatly reduces the burden on health workers.
Julian Potett, Policy Advisor for the Medicines Sans Frontieres Access Campaign, says:
Large-scale vaccination campaigns require millions of doses of the vaccine to be delivered to different areas in the shortest possible time.
India is expected to receive 40 to 50 crore doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, which is expected to reach around 250 million people between January and July next year.
Vaccination program has been implemented in India for the last 42 years.
Under India's immunization program, about 39 crore doses of vaccine for various diseases are given to 55 million people every year, especially newborns and pregnant women.
India has a strong network of government-owned cold storage for vaccines to carry out such a large-scale vaccination campaign.
Coolant packs such as small freezers, ice-covered refrigerators, refrigerated trucks, dry ice and cold boxes are needed to keep the vaccine cool.
Managing Director of Blue Star, a large company in pharmaceutical cold chain products.
The Covid-19 vaccine can be classified in three ways in terms of temperature, according to the World Health Organization.
Providing cold chains for a comprehensive vaccination campaign is going to be a big challenge.
India has a cold storage capacity of 40 tonnes.
Most of our vaccine storage capacity does not meet international standards.
Although the vaccine can be stored at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, most cold storage capacity is designed to vaccinate infants.
Andrew Taylor of the Duke Global Health Institute in the United States says, "There are many challenges that can be overcome. "
How can crackers increase the spread of corona?
The festival of Diwali has come in a few days.
Therefore, there will be many limitations on celebrating Diwali this year.
Firecrackers have been banned in many states in the country.
Every year, before Diwali, the issue of firecrackers and their pollution is discussed.
Many states, including Delhi and Rajasthan, have banned firecrackers
Covid-19 is a respiratory disease.
Firecrackers have been banned in Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Odisha to curb the spread of the corona virus.
The states said the decision was taken as a precautionary measure to prevent corona infection and pose a potential threat to the health of citizens.
A decision to ban firecrackers in Maharashtra has not been taken yet.
Health Minister Rajesh Tope had recently called for a firecracker-free Diwali to reduce the death toll from corona and as a precaution against a possible second wave.
Therefore, it is being said that the Maharashtra state government is also considering banning firecrackers.
But what problems would arise if firecrackers were blown up during the Corona period?
Corona carriers will become pollutants
A study conducted in Jamshedpur had revealed that firecrackers were causing a lot of pollution during Diwali .
Firecrackers produce large amounts of smoke in the air.
During the winter, it can act as a carrier of aerosols and PM2.5 corona viruses, said Dr. Krishna Kumar, a pulmonologist at KIMS Hospital, Hyderabad.
He says, "Corona virus is a virus that spreads through the air.
High risk for patients with covidosis
The corona virus attacks the human respiratory system.
Dr. who was infected with corona.
After being cowardly, Dr. said that you are having the following problems.
To make our health as before, Dr. Khan has to undergo treatment again.
This means that people who have become cowardly may be at greater risk.
In this regard, J. of Mumbai. J. The head of the ear, nose and throat department of the hospital, Dr.
The challenge is to keep the respiratory system and immune system healthy during the corona period, he says.
Patients who have been exposed to Covid-19 for long periods of time on oxygen and ventilators have an increased risk of developing lung disease.
Asthma, an increase in asthma patients
Toxic substances like nitrogen dioxide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, volatile compounds are released into the air from firecrackers.
Dr. According to Jain, "Firecrackers are not the only thing that affects people with respiratory problems in old age.
Oxygen levels in the human body decrease after coronavirus infection.
Dr. Jain says, "Smoke from firecrackers disturbs the air balance.
Dr. who developed the corona vaccine.
The pharmaceutical company that develops the corona vaccine, Dr. Reddy has reported a cyber attack.
The company said its websites in India, England, the US, Russia and Brazil had been hacked.
The company said it had isolated all of its data center services to prevent the attack.
Last week, Dr. Reddy's was allowed to conduct tests in the third phase of Russia's Sputnik-5 vaccine.
The company declined to comment on whether the attack affected corona vaccine production.
The company's phone lines in Yorkshire and Cambridgeshire in the UK are closed.
Mukesh Rathi, chief information officer of the company, said, "We have isolated all data center services as a precautionary measure against cyber attacks.
Corona glue
We expect all services to be restored within the next 24 hours and this incident is unlikely to have any major impact on our process.
Dr. of India. Some media outlets had said that the production of Reddy's vaccine was hampered.
Dr. Reddy's was founded in 1986 and is based in Hyderabad.
Last week, the Drug Regulatory Authority of India (DRAI) approved the company to conduct a third phase trial at the primary level.
What is the plan of Modi government to make corona vaccine available to the people?
Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij administered the dose of Kovacin vaccine.
Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij on Friday inoculated a covacin vaccine being developed on corona.
The Pune-based Serum Institute of India explained the cost of corona vaccine.
According to reports so far, it is estimated that two doses of the vaccine will be needed every two to three weeks to prevent coronary heart disease.
In the wake of all this news, discussions have started on how the corona vaccine will reach the people in the country.
Government announcement
Coronavirus vaccine will be available in the first two to three months of 2021, said Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan.
This means that the countdown to the corona vaccine has begun.
Corona Vaccine, Serum, Oxford, Modern, Pfizer
The new vaccine is claimed to be 95 percent successful, according to preliminary findings of corona vaccine tests from the American company Moderna.
Just a few days ago, the Pfizer company claimed that the vaccine could be 90 percent successful.
The University of Oxford also said on Thursday that the corona vaccine was having an effect on senior citizens.
Modern vaccines will require minus 20 degrees Celsius, while Pfizer will need minus 70 to 80 percent.
In India, a cold storage system is available for vaccination campaigns for children.
This is why the Government of India, Oxford and the country are looking into the development of the covacin vaccine.
If all goes according to schedule, the covacin vaccine will be on the market by early next year. Storage of this vaccine will not be a problem for the Government of India.
Population of India and dose of vaccine
According to the Serum Institute of India, the company is in a position to produce 50 to 60 million doses of vaccine per month.
The company has stated that by February 2021, 100 million doses of the vaccine could be produced per month.
It is not clear what the agreement is between the Government of India and the Serum Institute of India.
Adar Punawala, chief executive officer of the Serum Institute of India, said the government had demanded 100 million doses of the vaccine by July 2021.
The central government has decided to make 300 million doses of the vaccine available to the public by July 2021.
It is not yet known whether the government will take the dose of the vaccine from the Serum Institute.
We are ready to provide 300 million doses to the Indian government by July, Punawala said.
In addition, the Serum Institute is part of the ongoing Covax scheme to deliver the vaccine worldwide through the World Health Organization.
The organization is also preparing to vaccinate for this initiative.
Where will the good news for vaccines come from?
Tests on five corona vaccines are underway in India.
The Serum Institute has entered into an agreement with four vaccine manufacturers in the world other than the Oxford vaccine.
Adar Punawala gave more information in this regard.
The new vaccine will hit the market every three to four months in the next one year.
If the vaccines initially introduced in the market are effective, the Serum Institute will not produce the rest of the vaccines.
Apart from this organization, some other organizations are also involved in vaccine production.
The vaccine being offered in Russia is likely to be tested in India.
Who will get the vaccine in the beginning ?
Whenever vaccines become available in the country, priority will be given to people working in the health sector, such as doctors, nurses and other staff.
When will the vaccine reach the general public?
Speaking at an event on Thursday, Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan said, "It is not possible to reach 135 crore Indians at a time.
The vaccine that is effective will need to be taken in two doses.
For the last 10 months, people working in the health sector have been working at the risk of their lives.
After that, people over the age of 65 will be vaccinated.
Dr. Harshvardhan also clarified that it is not the case that the government has the right to set the priorities, so they are setting their own minds.
This priority has been set by a committee set up on a scientific basis.
Member of the Policy Commission V. K. Paul is the chairman of this committee.
The list of people to be vaccinated in the first phase of health sector has been prepared by the Central and State Governments by the end of October.
Corona vaccine: Oxford vaccine with serum at a critical stage
The Oxford vaccine, which has a contract with the Serum Institute, is at a critical juncture and will be tested before Christmas, researchers said.
Oxford's performance will also benefit Indian company Serum.
In India, the Serum Institute of India is producing vaccines developed by Oxford University.
Earlier, Adar Punawala had said that the vaccine would be ready in India by December.
Human trials of the covshield vaccine will be completed by December and the vaccine may be available from January, Punawala had said.
Once the UK shares the data there and makes sure the vaccine is safe, we can apply for an emergency license to the Indian regulatory body in the next two to three weeks.
It will take time for the vaccine to arrive
But Punawala had said that it would take a long time for the vaccine to reach everyone.
Poonawala also said that there will be a shortage of corona virus vaccine by 2024.
He made the statement in an interview with the Financial Times about the production of corona vaccine.
Pharmaceutical companies are not rapidly increasing production capacity, so it will take 4 to 5 years for the vaccine to reach everyone, he said.
Even if the corona vaccine is said to be given in two phases like the measles vaccination campaign, the world will initially need about 15 billion doses, he said.
Given the state of the country's vaccine supply chain, we need to think about how the vaccine can be safely delivered to the country's 140 crore people, Punawala said.
The Serum Institute, along with 5 other companies around the world, will produce 1 billion doses of corona.
Half of this dose will be reserved for India, while half the dose will be supplied to the world, the Serum Institute has clarified.
However, Poonawala said that if large quantities of the vaccine were demanded from the US and Europe, other countries would lag behind.
Meanwhile, the Serum Institute vaccine will cost Rs 225.
The Pune-based Serum Institute of India has entered into an agreement with Gavi, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to produce vaccine doses of over 100 million corona.
The ्स 150 million will be used to make the vaccine through the Gates Foundation's Strategic Fund.
Each dose of the vaccine will cost US 3 3, or Rs 225.
Corona: Are we in a 'touch famine' crisis?
Corona's companionship has plunged us into a new crisis.
In the case of people living alone, the chances are much higher.
Are we in a new health crisis?
Were some people even in this crisis before Corona?
BBC Radio 4 and the Welcome Collection jointly submitted a questionnaire to test this touch.
Do friends or strangers like to touch the body?
The test received mixed reactions on whether people get enough touch and whether society gets it.
Just over half of the respondents wrote that they had a small amount of touch in their lives, while 42 percent said that they had enough of the touch.
So it is clear that some people have an appetite for touch.
In research, about 75 percent said they like touch, while 27 percent said no.
The team also considered people's age and gender.
Two important things emerged from this observation.
The first is personality.
The second point is the relationship with other people.
Some people are more lenient with others.
Consensual touch is an important issue for people who want touch but the current world does not allow it.
Moreover, after the #MeToo movement on social media, people have become more conscious about touching others.
The next most important reason is the lack of social interaction.
This test shows how effective even a proper touch can be.
Research has also shown that people who love touch are satisfied or happy.
This research was done before the lockdown began.
People used to say that you don't feel much touch at that time.
Tiffany Field, a psychiatrist at the University of Miami School of Medicine in the United States, conducted an online survey in April.
By the end of April, people were beginning to feel that we were out of touch.
The second study was conducted by Merle Fairhurst in April.
In April, 61 per cent of people did not feel the touch of strangers, while 35 per cent did not feel the touch of their families.
If you hit the skin at a speed of 3 cm per second, it gets a specific reaction from the body.
Now you may think that people who were stuck in the house during the lockdown had spent time with their families.
But the findings of this research are different.
Only one in five parents did such things as hugging, hugging, or kissing their children.
That is why it is not surprising to say that we have lost touch.
The human body has a mechanism for recognizing the right or pleasant touch.
Chemical processes take place in the body after a pleasant touch is felt.
Not only that, but even considering such things, dopamine begins to become a hormone.
So what should we do about touch when the fear of infection is everywhere in the Corona period?
Many of the benefits of touch to people were found in research in April.
Research has shown that applying lotions or creams to your body can give you the same results as eating good food.
Touch has a unique significance.
If you can't touch anyone else, hug yourself.
Remember a beautiful hug you took in the past and try to relive that moment by wrapping your arms around your body.

Corona vaccine: how to vaccinate billions of people?
Vaccinating billions of people is going to be a big challenge.PHOTO SOURCE,REUTERS
India is a superpower when it comes to vaccine production.
A huge vaccination campaign is being carried out in India.
There are six major vaccine manufacturers in India, including the Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer.
By July next year, India plans to get 50 crore vaccines on covid and vaccinate about 250 million people.
In India, large populations are vaccinated every year and the same experience has now set such a big target.
The vaccination program in India is 42 years old.
In addition, India has a well-organized system for storing and quantifying these vaccines.
However, experts say that the first vaccination of billions of people, including billions of adults, against Covid 19 is difficult and unprecedented.
Out of 30 vaccines being developed in India, clinical trials of 5 vaccines are underway.
Apart from this, trials of Bharat Biotech vaccine, which is being developed in the country, are also underway.
AstraZeneca vaccine is also being tested in India.
Selecting some vaccines from the available vaccines, their distribution, deciding who to vaccinate at the beginning is a big challenge.
She was the first Indian woman to be elected a Fellow in the Royal Society of London.
We don't want to underestimate the complexity of the process.
What are the challenges facing India in the vaccination campaign?
Supply Chain and Logistics (Transportation)
There are about 37,000 cold chain stores in India.
These vaccines can be sent to 80 lakh places from these places.
India will need enough auto disabled syringes to deliver so many vaccines.
India's largest syringe maker has said it aims to produce 1 billion syringes by next year to meet the growing demand for such syringes.
The question then arises as to whether the supply of medical glass vials for vaccines should be maintained.
India's vaccination program is implemented with the help of about 40 lakh doctors and nurses.
I am worried about how we will take these things to rural India, Kiran Majumdar-Shaw, founder of Biocon, a leading biotechnology company in the country, told me.
Who will get the vaccine first?
The vaccine will be available in limited quantities until next year.
Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said the vaccine would be available to private and government health workers and frontline workers from 'other departments' first.
We will never have enough vaccines available.
The Serum Institute in Pune is the largest vaccine manufacturer in the world.
The Serum Institute in Pune is the largest vaccine manufacturer in the world.
So in a country where most of the healthcare system is private, will the private health worker be given priority or the government employee?
Will permanent employees be preferred over contract employees?
If senior citizens with co-morbidity are eligible for early vaccination, which of the various diseases will be given priority?
For example, more than 7 crore people in India have diabetes.
It will not be possible to deliver the vaccine to all the 30 states at the same time.
It is inevitable that the question will be asked whether there will be equality and no discrimination.
Look at the millions of doses of vaccines
Prashant Yadav says it would be easier for India to get enough doses to reach so many people relatively quickly if it contracts with different vaccine manufacturers to produce a bunch of different vaccines rather than relying on a single vaccine.
He is studying the healthcare supply chain at the Center for Global Development in Washington.
However, he says that the success of the regular vaccination campaign does not mean that the vaccination campaign for Kovid-19 will be successful.
Prashant Yadav says, "Even though the regular vaccination drive is largely carried out by government clinics, there is no plan to run such a vaccination campaign for adults and some of these adults do not visit government health centers regularly."
That is why it is important to involve both private and government agencies in the vaccination campaign for Covid 19, he said.
Kiran Mazumdar Shaw and Nandan Nilekani, co-founder of Infosys, suggested that the Aadhaar number should be used to keep track of who is being vaccinated.
Six companies in India are trying to develop a vaccine for covid.
We have to come up with a system that will give 1 crore vaccines a day across the country but it will all have a common digital foundation, Nilekani told a newspaper .
Corruption to get vaccinated?
Concerns have also been raised about corruption in obtaining the vaccine.
How will the authorities ensure that people do not submit false documents so that you can be included in the list of early vaccinators?
Note the side effects
Vaccines have side effects on some people.
However, researchers have found that the incidence of such side effects is low.
So if something like this happens, it can create fear about these vaccines.
Who will pay?
This is probably the biggest question. Will the government take control of all doses of vaccine and then ask the states to implement free or low cost vaccination campaign?
Will the rich be able to buy for themselves the doses available in the market through private distribution and sale?
Until the outbreak is stopped, the government should bear the cost of vaccination given to every Indian, said Dr. There is a ripple effect.
Nandan Nilekani estimates that a single dose of the vaccine will initially cost between 3 to 5 US dollars (225 to 375 rupees).
Therefore, a vaccine that costs half a dollar, or Rs 36-37 per dose, which is available in abundance and requires a single dose, will be suitable for India, says Gagandeep Kang.
Corona vaccine: Apply for emergency license in two weeks, initially distributed in India - Adar Punawala
In the next two weeks, Siram Institute will apply to the Government of India for an emergency license, said Adar Punawala, CEO and owner of Siram.
Also, the vaccine will be distributed initially in India, then in the Caucasus, the countries in Africa, said Adar Punawala.
The Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi visited the Serum Institute today (November 28) and took stock.
Regarding the PM's visit, Adar Punawala said, "The PM has held in-depth discussions with members of the Serum Institute.
The Prime Minister had detailed information about the vaccine.
The vaccine being developed at the Serum Institute is good.
Narendra Modi reviews vaccine production
The Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi visited the Serum Institute of India in Pune to review the production of corona vaccine.
Narendra Modi arrived at Lohgaon Airport in Pune on an Air Force plane.
He informed about the work of vaccine in Siram Institute.
Adar Poonawala, CEO and owner of Siram Institute, along with his family members were also present on the occasion.
Why the tour is planned with all the care about Corona.
He also visited vaccine companies in Ahmedabad and Hyderabad
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit three vaccine manufacturers in the country on Saturday (November 28).
First, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Zydus Biotech Park in Ahmedabad.
After Ahmedabad, he will visit Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad in the afternoon and then Serum Institute of India in Pune.
They will review the progress of vaccine production in all these companies, their readiness to produce large quantities of vaccines when the time comes.
Corona vaccine: The government has never said to vaccinate the whole country - Union Health Secretary
The government has never said it will vaccinate the entire country.
When we discuss issues related to science, it would be better if we come with basic information related to the subject.
Bhushan reiterated that the government has never said that everyone in the country will be vaccinated.
Corona infection can break the chain of infection if we can vaccinate people who are in a critical condition.
The role of the mask is extremely important.
Pfizer seeks permission from Government of India for emergency use of Corona vaccine
Pfizer has asked the government for permission to vaccinate.
Pfizer, a pharmaceutical company, has asked the Indian government to approve the anti-Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use in India.
Pfizer last week received calls from the governments of Britain and Bahrain for emergency use of the anti-corona vaccine.
Pfizer India has sent a letter to the DCGI in this regard.
Pfizer India has sent a proposal to the Drug Controller (DCGI) on December 4 for emergency use of the anti-corona vaccine, PTI reported.
The British government first approved the anti-covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech.
The Bahraini government announced on Friday that it had approved an anti-corona vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech.
The anti-corona vaccine, developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, has to be kept at a temperature of minus 70 degrees.
According to Pfizer, discussions are underway with the Indian government for the use of the vaccine in India.
The vaccine will be administered in accordance with the agreements reached after obtaining permission from the government for emergency use during the Corona crisis, the company explained.
Five vaccines against corona are currently in the final stages in India.
Corona: All schools in Mumbai Municipal Corporation area will be closed till December 31
All private, government and municipal schools in the Mumbai Municipal Corporation area will be closed till December 31, 2020.
Mumbai Municipal Commissioner has decided to close all schools till December 31 using his powers.
The testing camp has played and continues to play an important role in the measures taken to prevent corona.
The NMC has been implementing mass testing since time immemorial.
On the other hand, state education minister Varsha Gaikwad said the local administration would take a decision to start the school.
"I had left the decision to start the school to the local administration.
What did the education minister say to the BBC?
School Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad had told BBC Marathi that the school would start after Diwali in Maharashtra.
She said, After Diwali, I will decide when to start the school based on the situation in Corona.
Also, the number of patients is declining in Maharashtra.
The central government has handed over the decision to start the school to the state government.
The Union Ministry of Education has given clear instructions that a student cannot be forced to come to school without the written permission of the parents.
'Corona's second wave in danger'
Although the number of corona patients in Maharashtra is declining, the state government has not yet announced a timetable for starting schools on the backdrop of endangering the health of school children.

With the start of the academic year on June 15, online education is being offered by private schools.
Parents are complaining that some schools are charging unreasonable fees and depriving them of education if they do not pay the fees.
Also, parents are asking why they have to pay full fees as the school is closed.
Varsha Gaikwad said, "We had issued a ruling to reduce fees during the Corona period.
But if the school does not provide online education due to non-payment of fees or the student suffers academic loss, the parents should lodge a complaint with the education authorities.

Serious infection for doctors and health workers who care for patients in the ICU room.
Dr. Kakkar and his colleagues have cared for hundreds of Kovid patients at the hospital since the summer days.
More patients than capacity were admitted to the hospital.
Working day in and day out, health workers face physical fatigue and mental stress.
Dr. Kakkar said, "There was a patient here.
Mumbai resident Asim Gargwa is 31 years old.

Dr. Gargwa goes on to say, "It was very difficult to tell this story to his wife.
An atmosphere of healing and fear
Covid-19 has spread all over India.
In India, the number of beds in hospitals has been increased to fight the corona epidemic, but the number of health workers is not as expected.
In such a situation, the hospitals gave practical training to each doctor.
But even that is not enough.
With the onset of cold weather, the number of patients has also started increasing. In such a situation, the energy in the doctor is running out.
Speaking about this, Dr. "Actually, Corona has never run out of hospitals, but people in the outside world have no idea," says Kakkar.
But it is not just the Corona outbreak that has made the health workers' condition worse.
According to doctors, corona is considered to be a patient with difficulty breathing.
Nowadays, doctors and nurses need to be careful because of the covid companion.
Seriously ill patients are admitted to the hospital and come directly to the intensive care unit.
Health workers tired
One doctor told me, "Doctors and nurses are working for hours on end.
He showed me some photos he had taken in his mobile.
In June, Dr. Gargwa had taken a photo of his hands after completing the long shift work.
This was due to the fact that his hands remained in the rubber gloves for hours.
During this time many employees did not go to their homes for several months.
Health workers used to stay in the hospital to keep the family safe.
Dr. Kakkar was infected while on leave.
At the end of November, Prachi Agarwal, an anesthesiologist at Delhi's Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan Hospital, started the ninth round of Covid-19 duty.
One round is eight consecutive hours of duty in the ICU for 15 consecutive days.
After that you have to quarantine in the hotel for a week.
Dr. Agarwal said, "Life is weird right now.
The doctors and nurses who saved the lives of others did not even have time to mourn the loss of their loved ones.
A doctor in Mumbai told me, "Some of my friends are taking medication for fatigue.
He says, "I get angry when I see people wearing masks and going to weddings.
Some people are also bothered by being called a coward warrior.
Dr. "We've gone beyond that," says Kakkar.

Is pork used in making corona vaccine? Reality check
The covid vaccination campaign started in India on January 16 and there have been many claims on social media about the vaccine before and since.
The government has also appealed to all to get vaccinated without paying attention to 'rumors and misinformation'.
We are going to verify the veracity of some of the claims made on a large scale.
Claim: The vaccine will make you impotent - wrong
A political leader from Uttar Pradesh has recently made this claim.
Samajwadi Party leader Ashitosh Sinha said, "I think there is something in Lashi that can harm your body.
Earlier, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav had also criticized the corona vaccine as 'BJP vaccine'.
However, there is no evidence that the vaccine can cause impotence.
The vaccine can cause a slight fever or body aches.
Union Health Minister Dr. Harshvardhan has also rejected this claim.
Vaccination makes a person impotent, a claim not new in India.
There is no truth in this claim and no such evidence is available.
Claim - Vaccines expensive in the US and England
A similar false claim is being made about India and the Anglo-American vaccine.
To show that the vaccination program in India is better than in both the US and the UK, one has to pay Rs 5,000 for the corona vaccine in the US and Rs 3,000 for the vaccine in the UK. However, a Twitter user wrote that the vaccine is free in India.
Hindi news channel ABP News also showed this news.
In fact, the US government has made it clear that the vaccine will be provided free of charge.
However, this fee is also included in the health insurance and those who do not have health insurance will be paid under the Special Covid Relief Fund.
This claim is also false about England.
The National Health Service is provided from the taxes paid by the citizens and the health care is free for the citizens.
In the first phase of vaccination in India, health workers were vaccinated and the vaccine was free for them.
Claim - Corona lasi in dukaracam meat
Corona vaccine may contain pork and therefore Muslims should not be vaccinated, some Muslim clerics in India have appealed.
Gelatin, sometimes made from pork, is used as a stabilizer in vaccines against many diseases, and eating pork is forbidden in the Muslim religion.
Corona's vaccine has not been declared "halal" under Islamic law, a post circulated on social media.
Two vaccines for corona are allowed in India .
Neither of these vaccines used gelatin made from pork.
Pfizer and Moderna are two other corona vaccines that do not contain pork.
Some of the pork-related posts circulating on social media claim to have used pork in a Chinese-made vaccine.
In some other countries, disputes have arisen over Chinese vaccines.
Claim - Lashi has a microchip
Conspiracy theories about corona vaccine are circulating in many parts of the world.
A short video of a Muslim cleric is circulating on social media.
The video also went viral on Twitter and Facebook earlier this month.
However, despite repeated claims by 'conspiracy theorists' around the world, no vaccine uses a microchip.
Corona virus: 5 important ways to keep corona away at home and in the office
Can pure fresh air keep the corona away?
The spacious design that keeps the air moving is important in keeping the corona away from staying at home.
For months, we have been told to wash our hands, apply sanitizer, and observe social distance to keep the corona virus at bay.
But according to scientists and engineers, what air we breathe is just as important as what goes into our respiratory bodies.
Let's look at how good ventilation is the key, with five points.
If you go into a room and feel that the air is stale, then there must be something wrong with the ventilation.
If clean open air does not play, the chances of getting infected with the corona virus increase.
According to new research, corona viruses are more likely to spread through the air in densely populated areas where air is trapped.
A regulation for workplaces was issued after the corona infection began to grow.
That's why if you go somewhere and find yourself in a quandary, get out of there, says Dr. Krishna Kumar, Technical Director, Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers.
He clarified that it is necessary to get pure open air continuously.
If the corona infected person is in the building and you can leave a lot of free air there, then you are working to clean the contaminated air through that infected person. You reduce the risk of other people getting corona infections.
2. Know the design of AC
In offices, shops are equipped with air conditioning system.
Split air conditioner is a white box mounted on the wall.
In other words, this AC makes the air hot and cold.
One customer had a corona infection.
If a large amount of open air had come in from the outside, they thought the corona virus would have been prevented and fewer people would have been infected.
3. The ratio of open air
Modern types of buildings have sealed glass, so how will the new open air continue to play?
You depend on the ventilation system.
Considering the corona infection, more and more new fresh air is being urged to be released into the enclosed environment.
Professor Cath Knox says it's best to have 100 percent pure fresh air.
The more open air there is in the building, the less likely it is that the corona virus will spread.
To keep 100 percent open air fresh, the air has to be heated in the cold and heated in the summer, and it requires energy.
4. Check that there is no virus in the filter
In modern ventilation systems, make sure the filters are fitted but not foolproof.
In the United States, researchers at the Oregon University of Health and Sciences found that filters blocked corona viruses, but in some cases the viruses escaped without getting caught in the filters.
According to Professor Kevin van der Weilberg, an inspection of the filter reveals whether a corona-infected person is working in the building.
A call center on the 11th floor in South Korea infected more than 90 people with a corona.
Dr. Weimlenberg thinks that if the filter data is checked, it is possible to decide where to expel the virus and how to prevent it.
5. Lack of fresh air
Talk to any expert in the field.
But the person who manages this job can tell that it is not so easy.
Nick Wirth was designing a Formula One racing car.
If the infected person is by the window, the virus can reach people downstairs through his or her exhalation.
More and more fresh air is good, but if the air is flowing horizontally and contains viruses, it can have an effect.
Professor Kath Knox was asked about this.
More people can be infected with the corona through an open window.
There are many controversies in this regard because we still do not know many things about the corona virus.
But one thing is for sure, the air we breathe must be pure, fresh.
Corona Virus: Is the current drop in numbers the silence before the second wave?
Is it dramatic or incomprehensible to reduce the number of corona patients in India as many think?
Is the corona virus withdrawing from India, the country where the corona is expected to kill millions?
In October , I wrote in detail about why the spread of corona is declining across the country .
Since then the situation has improved a lot.
Since last week, an average of 10,000 corona patients have been found in the country every day.
So far, more than 1 crore people in India have been infected with the corona.
Most epidemics usually increase in bell-shaped curves and worsen as well.
While corona infection is declining in India, there is nothing unusual about it.
Experts believe that there are several possible reasons for the decline in the number of corona patients.
Bhramar Mukherjee, a professor of biology and epidemiology at the University of Michigan, says, "We do not yet have an explanation for the epidemic.
Heard immunity is the immunity of a group.
Why is India far from herd immunity?
According to a recent CIRO survey, 21 percent of adults and 25 percent of young people are already infected with corona.
The report also found that 31 per cent of slum dwellers, 26 per cent of non-slum dwellers but 26 per cent of urban dwellers and 19 per cent of rural dwellers were infected with corona.
But experts say that number is still very low.
The president of the Delhi-based think tank 'Public Health Foundation of India', Dr. K Srinath Reddy said, "There is no region in the country that has acquired herd immunity. Anyway, some small parts may exist."
Therefore, despite the high incidence of infection, people who have not yet been infected with the corona can live in their own protected areas.
Why is the number of patients declining?
There are various reasons for this, experts say.
One is that cases of corona patients are declining at different times in different parts of the country.
People in densely populated cities are more likely to be infected with corona than small villages.
In my opinion, the risk of corona infection is much higher than what the survey is saying.
Another reason for this is that many patients in India were not diagnosed, as hundreds of infected people did not show symptoms of corona.
If we had a large number of patients with very mild or asymptomatic symptoms, we would have already reached herd immunity.
Is low mortality a secret?
Most scientists say that more Indians have died from corona infection than official figures.
However, the low figures did not create an atmosphere of public fear.
India announced a lockdown at the end of March to prevent the spread of the virus.
Extensive use of masks, the closure of schools and offices, and the introduction of the work-from-home option have reduced the incidence of corona infection in the worst-hit cities.
Coronas cause fewer deaths among young people because they have better immune systems, scientists say.
However, more than 65 per cent of Indians live and work in rural areas.
The majority of urban workers work in the unorganized sector.
People who work in open or semi-enclosed spaces have a lower risk of infection, he said. Says Reddy.
Is there another wave in India?
It would be hasty to say that.
Some experts fear that corona infection in India could increase significantly during the early monsoon season.
After the end of the monsoon, we can only assess whether the corona has started spreading in the country again, based on the available information, a communicable disease specialist said on condition of anonymity.
Scientists say a new species of corona found in South Africa, Brazil and the UK is the real problem .
Many in India are not infected with the corona.
By the end of January, 160 patients with corona UK strain had been found in India.
A new strain of the corona was discovered in September in Kent, UK, and in the next two months it caused another wave.
There are enough scientific laboratories in India, but genome sequencing is still a challenge, experts say.
The story of Corona's new strain is too long.
India needs to accelerate vaccination campaigns .
The government aims to vaccinate 300 million people by August to ensure that the second wave of corona does not spread.
But, there is no satisfactory progress yet.
Corona Information: Answers to 11 questions in your mind such as lockdown, pets, mask use.
Do you have any questions about corona virus?
BBC Marathi is trying to give direct and accurate answers to all your questions according to the information given by experts from all over the world.
1. In which zone is my district? How did it happen
The central government on May 1 released a district-wise list of corona viruses across the country.
All the districts are divided into Red, Orange and Green zones by the number of patients in each district, how many days it doubles (doubling rate), the extent and scope of testing as well as expert observation.
A red zone is a district, taluka or municipal area where a large number of corona patients may have been found.
Orange Zone is a district in which no new coronary artery disease has been detected in the last 14 days.
So the green zone is the district in which no corona patient has been found or no new patient has been found in the last 21 days.
You can read more about this here in which zone is my district?
2. Call the maid?
There is some confusion as to whether they will be able to go for housework as the maid is not included in the list given by the state government on what will continue and what will be closed in the third phase of the lockdown.
But the maid does not need permission to go for housework except in the containment (restricted) zone, the Chief Minister's Office has informed BBC Marathi.
If the maid lives in the landlord's house, permission is not required, he added.
However, if the housing society does not want to allow someone to come in, they can take an independent decision, but they need a good reason to deny the permission, Gagrani said.
3. Why did the number increase despite the lockdown?
Even after a month and a half of lockdown, the number of corona patients is increasing in the country including Maharashtra.
There could be a number of reasons for the increase in the number of patients - such as whether the lockdown is being strictly enforced.
State Survey Officer Dr. about the statistics in Maharashtra.
Also, in cities like Mumbai and Pune, people live in densely populated areas.
With the increasing number of corona tests, the number of patients will naturally increase.
Another reason for this is that about 80 percent of patients with corona are asymptomatic, meaning they do not show any symptoms.
4. Will Corona go when summer arrives?
Many had said so. You may have also received such WhatsApp messages.
No virus is destroyed at 60-70C.
The British doctor Sarah Jarvis says the temperature is affected by the corona virus.
The virologist Dr. According to Paresh Deshpande, rising temperatures can greatly reduce the duration of its extinction.
It is generally known that the virus does not last long outside the body during summer days, but the exact effect of heat on it is not yet known.
Mark Lipsich, a researcher at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, says, "We can't just sit back and hope that the harsh summer will come and stop the spread of the corona virus.
5. Are coronaviruses at higher risk for pregnant women?
During pregnancy, a lot of changes take place in the body.
Paul Hunter, a professor at the University of Anglia in the UK, says, "It's not fair to say that everything is fine with just 9 pregnant women.
Although the corona virus is now new, pregnant women are at higher risk of contracting the flu than other women their age.
The youngest patient ever infected with the corona virus was a one-day-old baby.
6. Do pets cause corona?
The disease is said to have spread to humans by eating the flesh of a wild animal in Wuhan.
But in the first week of April, a 4-year-old tiger in a zoo in the United States was also infected with the corona virus, according to a report.
According to the evidence available so far , cats and dogs have been infected with corona virus in some places.
But the condition of any of the animals was not alarming.
Researchers and veterinarians think this is very unlikely.
But can corona virus be transmitted from animal fur?
7. Will wearing a mask keep me safe?
Much depends on which mask you are using.
But wearing a mask does one more thing - constantly rubbing your face.
But not everyone has to wear a mask.
Who are sick and who have symptoms of corona
Who are serving or caring for coronaries.
Medical masks should be reserved for health workers only, the WHO said.
Other ordinary people have to wear masks, not because -
When wearing or removing masks, they can be contaminated by coughing or sneezing by other people
It is more effective to wash your hands regularly and observe social distance
Masks can create a false feeling that you are safe
8. Does eating garlic make the corona go away?
Garlic is a health nutrient. It has some anti-microbial properties.
But there is no evidence that eating garlic protects against the corona virus.
Also, there is no evidence that eating cloves, swallowing salt water, or placing a mole under the nose can prevent corona.
If you read or hear anywhere that any home remedy cures corona virus, please don't believe it.
Yes, we all know that including fruits and vegetables in our diet and drinking plenty of water is beneficial for overall health.
9. Will insurance companies pay for the treatment?
If your doctor suspects you are infected with the corona virus, they will refer you directly to a government hospital.
Although there is currently no panacea for corona, the mortality rate is 1 to 3 percent, meaning that 97-98 out of 100 people recover and return home.
Mayank Bathwal, CEO, Aditya Birla Health Insurance, said, "Currently, all our insurance products and health indemnity reimbursement products cover the corona virus.
But if you don't hire, your expenses won't be covered.
IRDAI is the regulatory body of insurance companies.
10. Infection due to touching notes?
You also know how much money you have and how you handle it.
The Chinese government is currently ordering its banks to sterilize all notes.
11. How to take care?
For now, just wash your hands, use a mask, and hold a handkerchief over your nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing.
If you have a cold-cough-fever, be careful, see a doctor immediately and take the necessary medicine.
Corona Vaccine: Vaccination of 60-year-olds and 45-year-olds from March 1 - Javadekar
The general public's wait for the vaccine is about to end.
Citizens will be able to get the vaccine at 10,000 government and 20,000 private vaccination centers across the country.
The vaccination drive was launched on January 16 last month after vaccines were allowed in India.
Covid warriors are the medical personnel working in the front line for the eradication of corona, the police as well as the government employees of the concerned departments.
Accordingly, doctors, nurses and other medical personnel from all parts of the country were initially vaccinated.
So, the number of vaccinated people in the country has gone up to more than 1 crore.
Guidelines issued by the Center
The central government on December 14 issued a regulation on how corona vaccine will be given to everyone in India.
According to PTI, "100 to 200 people will be vaccinated in each session every day.
Also only one person at a time will be allowed to go to the vaccination center.

These instructions to the states state the use of technology.
The digital platform will be used to track vaccine recipients as well as the corona virus vaccine.
Only those who are registered at the vaccination centers will be vaccinated.
The Center has instructed the states to plan according to which company's vaccines will be available in which states.
According to the Covid Vaccine Operational Guidelines, the vaccinated box, bottle or ice-pack should not be exposed to direct sunlight.
The vaccine will be taken out of the storage area only after the person arrives to inject it.
According to the rules, "100 people will be vaccinated in each session.
According to the rules, the central government plans to vaccinate 30 crore people in the first phase of the vaccination drive.
Citizens need to register on the Co-Win website to get vaccinated.
Which vaccine will be used in India?
It is hoped that 60 crore people will be vaccinated in India in the first phase by August 2021, said V.S. K. Was expressed by Paul.
Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech, which conduct vaccine trials in India, have applied to the regulator for permission for emergency use.
Serum's Covishield, Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, Zydus Cadilla's Zykov B and Russia's Sputnik 5 will be available in India as the temperature is ideal for storing these four vaccines.
Cold storage systems are being set up on a large scale in India to store the vaccine, which can be stored at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius. K. Paul had said.
Extremely cold temperatures are required to store Pfizer and Modern vaccines.
Pfizer had applied for permission for emergency use in India, but withdrew the application in early February.
Here are five things we need to learn from these countries that have overcome the Corona outbreak
Various measures have been taken by different countries over the past year to curb the spread of the corona virus.
I aired Covid for the last year.
After studying all this information, I realized that there are four things that are important to control the spread of the virus and the deaths caused by the virus.
Take prompt and effective action to control and check passengers at the border
Testing, tracking and tracing every suspected patient suspected of having coronary infection.
To provide all that help to those who have been quarantined to prevent the spread of the virus
Effective leadership and consistent and timely public messaging
No one has claimed that we all took the right measures.
Step 1: Preparation
Stanley Park lives in Seoul, the capital of South Korea.
A hospital like Yangji in Seoul, South Korea, was completely reserved for Kovid.
This is not his first experience with global communicable diseases, says Stanley.
Not only Stanley but his country also learned a lesson from that merger and made 48 amendments to deal with emergencies that posed a threat to public health.
Xu Yeon had just returned from Atlanta.
South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sai-kyun had said, "History repeats itself - we have taken strict preventive measures from the beginning to prevent this from happening again."
Step 2: Test, track and trace
It was March last year.
The lockdown was imposed in the UK at the end of March last year.
On the other hand, most of the East Asian countries started tracing in January.
Outside the hospital, a 'track and test' team is monitoring every suspect.
Not only that, but in South Korea, when there were no cases of Kovid-19 disease, Prime Minister Chung Sai-kyun took up the matter himself and took action, prioritizing 'tests, tracks and traces'.
It simply came to our notice then that we were getting better and better results, he said.
South Korea has a population of 52 million and 1,693 people have died from corona so far.
On the other hand, the UK government says that the testing system is constantly improving and is doing everything possible to make it stronger.
Step 3: Quarantine assistance
Usha Kumari, a community health worker in Kerala, India, says:
There are 30,000 'Asha employees' like Usha in Kerala.
In the area allotted to Usha, those who were instructed to stay in isolation in the house were given the responsibility of making sure that they were following all the given rules and providing them with all the things they needed.
Not only that, but in Kerala, 'Community Kitchen' was started from the very beginning of Kovid.
Financial assistance was also given to the needy.
The report was released in September by the UK-based Scientific Advice Group for Emergencies.
Following this experience, the UK government has broadened the criteria for providing financial assistance to coronet sufferers in isolation.
Kerala was hit by the Nipah virus three years ago.
Kerala has a population of 3.5 crore.
Step 4: Take care of the elderly
In early April last year, General Physician Lisa Federley began testing coronaviruses in care homes in Tbingen, Germany.
In Italy and Spain, Covid-19 had the greatest impact on senior citizens, and Boris Palmer, the mayor of Tbingen, felt that "a shield should be built around those most at risk."
He gave the local funds received by the mayor to help the senior citizens.
As a result of all this, the University Hospital in the city was not crowded with Covid patients and it was not time to close any other operations at the hospital.
Compared to other countries in the UK, Germany adopted a slightly different approach to preventing the spread of the corona.
In fact, care homes across the UK have been closed to outsiders from the very beginning.
Infectious Diseases Pvt. "Nursing homes are the most high-risk people in the elderly, and this is not surprising," said Dale Fischer.
Step 5: Vaccination campaign
Today more than two and a half million citizens in the UK have received at least one dose of the corona vaccine.
The key to the UK's success in the vaccination campaign is planning for the campaign.
However, this planning has not been seen in Europe.
The situation is even worse in developing nations.
Michael Kuta lives in Cape Town, South Africa.
Gavi, an organization of G-7 countries, was formed to help poor countries get the corona vaccine.
In any case, a concerted effort at the international level is needed when formulating a vaccination policy.
'Big price paid'
Vaccine distribution has started globally today.
Pvt. Dale Fisher says we should learn from the experience of the last 12 months.
He says, "A great crisis has befallen us and we have paid a heavy price for it.
Why is lockdown being discussed in Maharashtra?
The second wave of corona virus outbreak has hit Maharashtra and lockdown is being discussed again to curb the spread of the disease.
The number of patients has been declining, but since the end of February, it has been growing rapidly again.
But how serious is the situation in the state really?
Record increase in patient numbers
This graph will show how much faster the number of patients has increased during the second wave than the first wave of covid.
The active patient population is the number of patients currently suffering from covid.
The country was locked down at the beginning of Kovid's outbreak.
In September, six months after the outbreak, the eruption of Kovid reached its peak in Maharashtra.
But it began to rise again in mid-February, and within a month, in March, the number of patients had exploded.
Maharashtra ranks third in the world
Maharashtra ranks third in the world in terms of total number of covid patients by region.
Why the situation in Maharashtra is alarming, and why it should be monitored, will be understood by looking at this table.
Maharashtra currently has the highest number of patients in the country
Considering the active number of covid patients in the country, more than sixty per cent patients are in Maharashtra.
The question is whether mutation is not responsible for the mutation in the virus due to the high number of patients in Maharashtra.
At present, however, the majority seems to agree on one thing.
Gram Panchayat elections were held in rural areas.
Increase in the number of patients in all parts of the state
During the second wave of covid, the number of patients is increasing rapidly in all parts of the state, cities and even rural areas.
See statistics of these six major cities in the state.
Increase in the number of patients in all parts of the state
But this picture was worrisome, but it was expected.
Mortality rate has come down in Maharashtra
In countries around the world where the second wave of covid has hit, the picture is more or less the same, said a public health expert.
During the second wave, the corona virus spreads faster.
In Maharashtra too, a similar picture is emerging during the second wave.
Mortality rate has come down in Maharashtra
But as the number of patients grows, there may be a shortage of medical facilities.
Could such a situation arise in the next few days?
The number of checks increased in the state
As the number of covid patients has increased in the state, so has the number of check-ups.
The number of checks increased in the state
On September 27 last year, 1 lakh 88 thousand people in the state underwent covid test.
As on March 31, 1 lakh 67 thousand 078 people in the state have undergone covid examination.
But the test positivity rate has also increased, indicating how many of them were actually infected with the corona virus.
Across the country, the current test positivity rate is around five per cent, while in Maharashtra it is 14 to 15 per cent.
The higher the test positivity rate, the higher the risk.
Contact tracing is just as important as investigation to gain control over the disease.
Vaccination rates increased
The reassuring thing is that vaccination has also started in Maharashtra.
Vaccination rates increased
However, some feel that the rate of vaccination is still low compared to other states in the country and the rate at which the number of patients is increasing in Maharashtra.
Maharashtra Vaccination
The vaccine will also be available to citizens over the age of 45 from April 1, and the speed and rate of vaccination is expected to increase.
(Statistics: Union Ministry of Health, Maharashtra State Department of Health, ICMR, Johns Hopkins University)
Corona vaccine: Vaccine registration stopped for health workers; Center instructions
The Center has directed the state government and Union Territories to ensure that health and allied workers do not register for the vaccine.
In a letter to the state government and Union Territories, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, "The registration process for vaccines has been started for persons above 45 years of age.
The nationwide vaccination campaign started from 16th January.
Health workers and emergency services staff work to heal corona patients.
Bhushan Kumar writes, "In coordination with the State and Union Territories, all possible measures have been taken to ensure that these congregations are vaccinated.
A month has passed since these scheduled dates.
Corona, vaccine, health workers
The decision has been taken based on the feedback received from the vaccination centers.
The database of vaccinated health workers has increased by 25 per cent in the last few days.
Bhushan Kumar has directed that vigilance should be taken for the implementation of this decision at all levels.
Corona vaccine: Rajesh Tope says, 'Only enough stocks in the state for 3 days'
The second wave of Covid-19 caused a blast of corona infection in Maharashtra.
Health Minister Rajesh Tope has admitted that there is a shortage of anti-covid vaccines in the state.
Vaccination has been stopped in some districts of the state due to non-availability of vaccine.
Corona infection is spreading rapidly across the state.
On the one hand, Maharashtra is battling corona infection.
Shortage of Covid-19 vaccine in Maharashtra
According to experts, vaccination is the most effective way to control the rapidly spreading corona infection in the state.
Talking about the shortage of vaccines, Health Minister Rajesh Tope said, "Currently, there are only 1.4 million doses of anti-corona vaccines left in the state.
Vaccination has been stopped at some centers in the state.
Regarding the shortage of anti-Covid-19 vaccines in the state, Health Minister Rajesh Tope asked Union Health Minister Dr. Informed Harshvardhan.
Vaccinate people between the ages of 20 and 40
In Maharashtra, two mutations have been found in the Covid-19 virus.
Experts say the mutated virus is spreading faster.
Lockdown
Union Health Minister Dr. After the meeting with Harshvardhan, Rajesh Tope said, Currently, people in the age group of 20 to 40 are more likely to be infected with corona in the state. These people are traveling for work.
State Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had demanded vaccination of people above 25 years of age in a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi two days ago.
What does the central government say about vaccination?
According to the Union Ministry of Health, Maharashtra is at the forefront of anti-corona vaccination in the country.
8 crore people have been vaccinated so far across the country.
Speaking to reporters, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, "The main objective of vaccination is to prevent death due to infection.
No country has decided to vaccinate people above the age of 18 without thinking, Rajesh Bhushan added.
According to the central government, the situation in Maharashtra, Punjab and Chhattisgarh is critical.
Availability of vaccine in various cities of Maharashtra
Mumbai
More than 10,000 coronary heart disease cases were reported in the city on Tuesday.
About 50,000 people are vaccinated against covid every day in Mumbai.
Currently, only two days' supply of vaccines is available with the NMC, said Suresh Kakani, Additional Commissioner, Mumbai Municipal Corporation.
Pune
In Pune, on April 6, there were 15,300 doses of covshield and only 120 doses of covacin remaining, health officials said.
Speaking to BBC, Pune District Health Officer Dr. Bhagwan Pawar said, "Late on Tuesday night, 25,000 doses of covshield and 10,000 doses of covacin were received.
If stocks of vaccine become available, vaccines can be given tomorrow, he said.
Pune ranks first in the country in Corona hotspots.
Vidarbha
Vaccination has been stopped in Gondia district due to non-availability of anti-covid vaccine.
There is no vaccine available in the district, Kapase told the BBC.
The situation is similar in other districts of Vidarbha.
District Health Officer of Amravati Dr. Speaking to the BBC, Deepak Karanjekar said, "The district has enough stocks of anti-covid vaccines for the next three days.
The head of the state's vaccination campaign, Dr. D. N. Speaking to the Times of India, Patil said, "The central government needs to ensure a steady supply of vaccines.
Kolhapur-Sangli
According to the Kolhapur and Sangli district administrations, stocks of vaccines are available in the district only today (Wednesday).
Nashik
For North Maharashtra, 32,280 doses of covacin were received, according to the health department.
Ahmednagar district health officer Dr Sangle said, "There is a shortage of vaccines in the district.
So, there are enough doses of vaccine available in Thane for the next 3-4 days, said Sandeep Malvi, Public Relations Officer, Municipal Corporation.
Why the shortage of vaccines?
The country's largest vaccination campaign was launched in the country in January.
The ministers of the Mahavikas Aghadi government in the state had alleged that Maharashtra was not getting adequate stocks of vaccines from the central government.
Speaking about the shortage of vaccines in the state, former president of the Indian Medical Association, Dr. Ravi Wankhedkar says, "It is up to the central government to decide how many vaccines to give to which state.
Vaccination campaigns should be decentralized.
Does Remedivir really save the lives of Corona patients?
Is there a shortage of remedivir?
Long queues outside drug stores and rush to get a dose of the drug, a picture that has been seen outside some drug stores for the past week.
Currently the second wave of corona infections and hence the number of patients is increasing so much that the demand for remedesivir has also increased.
Finally, the central government decided to ban the export of remedesivir.
But in October 2020, when the World Health Organization (WHO) ruled that remedivir does not save the lives of corona patients, why are we using it so much?
What is Remedesivir though?
When covid 19 disease was new, many drugs such as remedesivir, hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone were considered globally while developing treatment methods.
Some drugs have been shown to be helpful in different ways, while others have been shown to be unhelpful.
Remedesivir is an antiviral drug
It was developed to fight Ebola
At the time of the initial outbreak of the corona, it was found to be effective in reducing symptoms.
However, it costs between Rs 1,100 and Rs 1,400 per dose
Later, the World Health Organization and a number of health organizations began to study the drugs used for corona in different countries and began research on which drugs are effective and efficient.
In October 2020, the World Health Organization released a detailed report on remedivir.
The health organization studied 11,266 patients in over 500 hospitals in 30 countries around the world, and found that remedicivir was not very effective in preventing coronary heart disease.
So why is remedivir used?
The Ministry of Health has laid down some guidelines on when to use this drug in India.
Accordingly, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Health Minister Rajesh Tope have also repeatedly expressed the view that remedicivir should be avoided.
Speaking at a press conference in Jalna, Rajesh Tope said, “Effective and efficient use of Remedesivir is a priority of the state government for the next 15 days.
Now, you may be wondering why Remadesevir is being used.
There is no drug on corona yet.
According to the guidelines stated by the World Health Organization, overuse of remedicivir should be avoided.
When to use Remedacivir?
So when exactly to use Remedesivir?
Corona infection occurs in the lungs. The HRCT test is used to check the severity of the infection.
If the patient's fever is not under control, the drug is given as an antiviral from the 4th to the 7th day, Gaikwad clarified.
Remadecivir is currently being used so much in Maharashtra that the drug is being bought on the black market at double the price.
From now on, the stock of this medicine will be distributed from the Collectorate to the government hospitals as and when required.
Sputnik-5: Do you know about the Russian vaccine coming to India?
India has paved the way for a third vaccine.
The vaccine was developed by Russia's Gamalaya Center.
Currently, Covishield of Serum Institute and Covacin vaccine of Bharat Biotech are being used in India.
Sputnik-5 vaccine Dr. Russia has said it will give Reddy to the lab.
The Russian Direct Investment Fund will cooperate for the clinical trial and distribution of the vaccine.
Russian Direct Investment Fund and Dr. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed between Reddy Labs and 30 crore doses of vaccine will be manufactured in India.
Shia scientists have published the first report on vaccine research in the world-renowned medical journal The Lancet.
The people who took the test tested positive for antibodies against the corona virus.
The vaccine was developed at the Gamaleya Institute, a government research center in the Russian capital, Moscow.
Corona Vaccine: Central Government Approves Covacin Vaccine Production at Mumbai's Halfkin Institute,
1. Central Government's approval for production of Covacin vaccine at Halfkin Institute, Mumbai
The central government has approved the production of Kovacin vaccine at the Halfkin Institute in Mumbai.
The Department of Science and Technology of the Union Government on Thursday (April 15) approved the transfer of Covacin vaccine from Bharat Biotech in Halfkin.
Secretary Science and Technology Renu Swaroop sent a letter to Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte in this regard.
The state government had a few days back asked the Center to allow vaccine production in Halfkin.
2. Infection of Corona to more than 1700 devotees in 5 days during Kumbh Mela
The Kumbh Mela is currently underway in Haridwar, Uttarakhand.
In the last 5 days of Kumbh Mela, between April 10 and April 14, more than 1700 devotees have been found to be infected with corona.
In the last five days, 2 lakh 36 thousand 751 people were tested in Kumbh Mela.
These are the figures for RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests performed in the last five days.
3. Own oxygen plants in 100 new hospitals from PM Care Fund
The PM Care Fund, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the Corona period last year, will have its own oxygen plants in 100 new hospitals, the Center said on Thursday (April 15).
Currently, corona virus cases are found in large numbers in 12 states of the country.
Currently more oxygen is needed during the corona period.
4. Congress is the largest party in the 2024 Assembly elections - Nana Patole
Congress state president Nana Patole has predicted that the Congress will emerge as the largest party in the state in the 2024 assembly elections.
We have a place for those who believe in the party, not for opportunists.
Patole also expressed confidence that the next MLA in Indapur will be from the Congress.
5. Damage to agriculture due to untimely rains
Vidarbha, Marathwada in Maharashtra and some parts of Western Maharashtra have received unseasonal rains.
Solapur district has received unseasonal rains for the last three days.
For the last three days, unseasonal rains have lashed the rural areas including the city of Solapur.
The current situation of any city in Maharashtra, in fact, any city in the country.
The number of people who die from covid comes to the fore every day, a little shaky, we leave by mistake, we start working.
Suddenly numbers become not just numbers but our rush for survival.
My grandmother used to say that she would patch him wherever the sky broke.
Do you know how a man who dies with a corona dies?
People who go through corona or close relatives often suffer from the same disease.
I saw it in the cemetery.
How to tell in detail.
The hearse is coming, the cheetahs are burning.
Husband, wife, world, children are nobody.
The dead man is wrapped in plastic, there is no question of bringing him home.
When the man went to the hospital, he was in a hurry to get out of bed.
At least the closest people who could bury their men were called lucky (!).
A story told by a journalist friend.
Do you know what happens when your man dies?
A few days ago I saw a photo from Brazil.
It does not leave a mark after death.
When someone cries, no one comes forward to put his hand on his shoulder to comfort him.
In the flames of the six or seven cheetahs burning in front of him, he does not even know where his man was set on fire.
Now the people who have stopped to think about when their man will be numbered to burn in the leopard, the men working in the cemetery almost like a machine, the ambulances that are constantly coming, the cheetahs in front of them and their light everywhere is just horrible.
From a distance of half a kilometer, you can see that there is a cemetery in front of you.
The rest of the year is not Panavati, time is not Panavati, we are human beings Panavati.
Note: A member of BBC Marathi has shared his experience in this blog.
Corona virus: What tests should be done to check for covid 19?
Testing is the only option to find out if a person has a corona infection.
From the very beginning, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said that testing is a great weapon in the war against corona.
Three types of tests can be done to see if the corona virus has entered your body.
But it is equally important to understand the exact differences between these tests and their accuracy.
What is an RT-PCR test?
RT-PCR stands for Real Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction.
This is also called swab test.
This laboratory test can take 2 to 5 hours, but considering the overall load on the labs, the results are usually given in one day in private laboratories in Maharashtra, while it takes 2 days in the laboratories of government hospitals.
The RT-PCR test can tell for sure if the corona is infected.
ICMR calls this test the gold standard of testing.
What is a Rapid Antigen Test?
Antigens are present on the surface of viruses that enter the body .
These tests also take swab samples similar to RT-PCR.
Samples of this test do not need to be taken to a laboratory for testing.
But these tests are likely to result in a false negative.
The ICMR states that a separate RT-PCR test is not required for positive results.
What is a Rapid Antibody Test?
Our body's immune system builds protein cells through plasma to fight a virus.
A person's blood samples are taken in an antibody test.
CIRO surveys have been conducted in different cities.
The ICMR had clarified in April 2020 that these tests should be used in hotspots or for such surveys.
The role of these antibodies in the fight against corona is important, so patients who have recovered from corona are now being given plasma corona to patients who are being treated with plasma therapy.
Pune Corona: Why is Corona growing in rural Pune?
The first corona patient in the state was found in Pune, after which the graph of patient growth in Pune is on the rise.
After the unlock, the corona has now spread to rural areas as well.
This was the first case of more than 200 coronavirus patients in rural areas in a single day.
On the day the survey was conducted, on September 9, 1152 coronaviruses were found in rural Pune, while on September 10, 1297 patients were found.
The number of patients growing daily in rural Pune is significant.
If you look at the table below, you can see the number of corona victims in Pune district in the last few days.
Corona is no longer afraid
The main reason for exploring the causes of corona growing in rural areas is that there is no fear of corona among the citizens and that is why some citizens have expressed their frustration over the measures to be taken to prevent corona.
Former Sarpanch of Khanapur village near Pune, Sharad Javalkar says, "Citizens are no longer afraid of corona like before.
There are cases of not being tested even when the symptoms of corona are seen and not informing the administration about it.
For the same reason, Dr. Baramati. Himgauri Wadgaonkar draws attention, "After unlocking, many people are leaving their homes for unnecessary reasons.
After the corona, we are not tested when the symptoms appear for fear of being ostracized by society, and the disease is removed from the limbs.
Constant contact with Pune
A large number of people from rural areas near Pune come to Pune every day for work.
Khadakwasalya Sarpanch Saurabh Mate says, The number of people going to Pune for work is higher in our village.
The picture of corona in rural areas became clear from the health survey
After the city of Pune, as the number of corona patients gradually increased in the rural areas, the festivals like Ganeshotsav and Moharram came and went, so the people of Manchar decided to conduct a health survey of the village.
A group of about 30 youths and doctors from the village went from house to house and conducted a preliminary examination of the citizens.
Only those with symptoms were sent for corona testing.
Former Sarpanch of Manchar village Datta Ganjale said, "Ganpati and Moharram are celebrated in our village with great enthusiasm.
Emphasis on micro-surveys
Corona patients are found in large numbers in 98 gram panchayats around Pune city.
Prasad said, "Currently, we are conducting health surveys in 98 villages with high number of patients.
Prasad further says, "The survey is being conducted in the same manner as the census survey.
According to the Pune Zilla Parishad, a total of 36,140 people have been infected with corona till September 22, while 23,135 people have recovered from corona.
On this day, 9336 patients are undergoing treatment in the hospital while 2777 patients are in home isolation.
What exactly is the disease that affects children after the corona virus is cured?
Infants with coronary artery disease are more likely to have a rare infection.
What is the infection after Covid-19 ?
Over the last few days, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MISC) or Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (PIMS) have been on the rise in the state. Not only in Mumbai, Thane and Vashi but also in areas like Vaijapur, children infected with Covid-19 were found to be infected.
Talking about this infection in children, the Chief Executive Officer of Wadia Children's Hospital in Mumbai, Dr. Mini Bodhanwala said,
The infection has been found in children who have undergone corona in the last few days.
The main cause of the disease is a sudden change in the immune system of the children.
What exactly is Kovisaki disease?
According to doctors, although the disease is rare, it can be fatal for young children.
A pediatrician from Vaijapur taluka of Aurangabad, Dr. This post-covidar disease affects the blood vessels and heart in young children.
In this disease, the body's immune system starts fighting against its own body, which affects the organs.
Pediatric Rheumatologist at Jupiter Hospital, Thane, Dr. Vijay Vishwanathan has also been treating children suffering from the disease in the last few days.
Dr. Viswanathan says, "Children's immune system is different from that of adults.
The disease is most commonly found in children between the ages of 7 and 15.
What are the symptoms of Kovisaki disease ?
Dr. According to Amol, "Fever and scarring are the main symptoms of the disease.
Dr. A few days back, Amol had diagnosed a seven-and-a-half-year-old boy in Vaijapur with Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (PIMS).
To explain the symptoms of this disease to the people in simple words, Dr. Vijay Vishwanathan has created an English alphabet chart for the people.
A- Abdominal pain
B- Bloody Eyes
C-Cardiac effects
D-Diarrhoea
E- Extreme Tiredness
Fever
Dr. Viswanathan says, "If parents take note of the A_B_C_D and pay attention to the changes in the body of the child, timely diagnosis and treatment is possible.
Is this disease different from 'Kawasaki' infection?
According to Web-MD, Kawasaki is a disease caused by viruses, bacteria or other causes.
Symptoms of Kawasaki-
Fever for more than 101 days
Acne
Redness of the eyes
Swelling of the glands in the neck area

We all believe that corona virus is transmitted only to senior citizens with weakened immune systems.
Information on corona-affected children in the state
Statistics of corona affected children in Mumbai
Dr. In Kawasaki, the blood vessels are affected, says Viswanathan.
'Build a special covid center for children'
Mumbai is now slowly recovering.
Dr. Subhash Salunkhe is an advisor to the state government. Dr. Salunkhe has instructed the state government to set up a special Covid-19 center for children.
Speaking to the BBC, Dr. Subhash Salunkhe says, "Children have a good immune system.
There is no denying the possibility of an increase in cases in children in the coming days.
Also, there are some diseases in children who have been released from Covid-19.
If you have symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea during Corona ...
I had diarrhea (diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration) so I initially took the usual diarrhea pills.
This is the experience of Bashir Jamadar, a recently released journalist.
Some patients do not show the symptoms that are common to coronavirus patients.
'Don't ignore diarrhea'
Patients are also confused as these are not the main symptoms of corona virus, such as fever, chills, sore throat, cough, and odorlessness.
One of our drivers was also admitted to Nair Hospital for treatment of diarrhea.
Even in OPDs run in government hospitals, patients with diarrhea have been found to be infected with corona.
Dr. Nair Hospital of Mumbai Municipal Corporation.
In many cases the patient appears to be ignoring these primary symptoms.
Some patients have a sore throat at the beginning.
'If the pain doesn't stop, test the corona.'
The head of the Corona Task Force, Dr. Sanjay Oak had earlier advised in a BBC interview not to take the pain off.
Although abdominal pain and diarrhea are not the main symptoms of corona, caution should be exercised.
Maharashtra does not have a large number of patients suffering from corona infection due to abdominal pain and diarrhea.
The Covid survey officer of the state health department, Dr. Speaking to BBC Marathi, Pradip Awate said, "In exceptional circumstances, diarrhea and abdominal pain are the symptoms of corona.
Corona testing is now easily possible in Mumbai and Pune as there is no need for a doctor's prescription to test for corona.
How does the corona virus spread to other organs?
The main symptoms of corona virus are that it spreads quickly to the upper part of the body, the respiratory tract.
The phlegm formed in the chest can travel to the intestines.
The corona virus appears primarily to attack the respiratory system.
Although swine flu is not a major symptom of diarrhea, there are some cases of abdominal pain and diarrhea.
What to do in case of diarrhea?
Diarrhea is more likely to occur during the rainy season due to food poisoning.
Did you have any body aches, fever or sore throat before diarrhea?
Did you come in contact with Corona Patient?
Doctors advise seniors, people with diabetes and other serious illnesses to have a corona test even if they have diarrhea.
Corona virus: What does India's improved graph mean?
It has been more than six months since the outbreak of the corona virus.
The university’s website opened on Wednesday (September 23).
I was surprised to see this graph when the number of patients was increasing by 70-80 thousand every day.
But the answer is not as simple as it seems.
Johns Hopkins figures show an average of the last seven days.
Raman Gangakhedkar, who is associated with the CG Pandit National Chair in Pune, says, "Coming down the graph just means dropping new patients.
Even with fewer tests, patients may be less likely to be found.
As many as 66.2 million tests have been conducted in India till September 22.
Dr. According to Gangakhedkar, "How it was tested is more important than how many people were tested.
Conclusions should not be drawn on the basis of tests
According to the expert information, the RT-PCR test of the concerned patient should be done after the rapid test comes negative.
Dr. Gangakhedkar explained this story with an example.
Suppose a state is undergoing 10 percent RT-PCR tests and 90 percent rapid tests.
Then this number is halved.
The RT-PCR test is considered the most accurate for corona testing.
The number of corona tests in the last two weeks has not dropped much.
The Government of India is saying that Corona's recovery rate is our success.
On Tuesday, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan dismissed all the allegations.
The central government is conducting daily, weekly and fortnightly analysis of the tests.
7 states that spoil India's graph
The seven most affected states in India are Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and West Bengal.
In the last few days, tests have been reduced in states other than Delhi.
Corona is currently widespread in rural India.
Dr. of Public Health Foundation of India.
It doesn't make much sense to see a drop in the corona's graph one day.
Currently, the government is more concerned about the situation in rural areas.
Member of Policy Commission (Health) V. K. "The government plans to send medical students to a three-month internship at a district hospital with more than 100 beds.
You can find out how the corona is spreading in rural areas from the CIRO survey.
In the second CIRO survey conducted at the national level, the survey was conducted in urban as well as rural areas.
The number of patients who have recovered in the last four days is higher than the number of new patients.
On the other hand, the time to come is festive.
Corona virus: Is the sanitizer you use the right one?
According to the Consumer Guidance Society of India, sanitizers used in Mumbai and across the state are of inferior quality.
Sanitizers have become an integral part of our lives.
Some companies are beginning to take advantage of this.
There are many sanitizers available in the market under the name of 99.9% virulent, fragrant, alcohol based.
All you need to do to protect yourself from the corona virus is use an alcohol-based sanitizer.
But, is the sanitizer you use right? Sanitizers have no side effects, do they?
A study by the Consumer Guidance Society of India, which works for consumer protection, found that more than 50 per cent of the samples taken for testing were adulterated.
What does the Consumer Guidance Society of India's study say?
122 samples of sanitizers were taken for testing
Tampering was found in 45 samples
In 5 samples people were found to have harmful methanol
The 59 samples were as shown on the label
Speaking to BBC about this, Honorary Secretary of Consumer Guidance Society of India Dr. M. S. "Gas chromatography tests were carried out on 120 samples collected from the market.
The most dangerous is the presence of methyl alcohol in 5 sanitizers.
What is Methyl Alcohol?
Methyl alcohol is a toxic substance, according to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
People who come in contact with methyl alcohol are more likely to be injured.
Methyl alcohol is absorbed into the skin.
Cosmetic dermatologist and surgeon from The Aesthetic Clinics, Dr. Rinki Kapoor said, “Given the growing demand for sanitizers, it has been observed that many shopkeepers are selling bogus sanitizers to make money.
The use of these bogus sanitizers increases the risk of skin problems.
The role of government in sanitizers
Speaking to BBC, state health minister Rajesh Tope said, "Non-quality sanitizer is not suitable.
Speaking about this, Dr. Kamath said, "The Center has taken note of this after our report.
Dr. Kapoor further said, "As per the order of the World Health Organization and the Central Government, sanitizers should not contain any fragrance.
Which sanitizer to buy
Talking to BBC about this, Mumbai-based dermatologist Dr. Bindu Sthalekar said, "People should be very careful while taking sanitizers.
How do you know if a sanitizer is good or bad at home?
You can also check if the sanitizer is suitable for use at home.
Dr. of Consumer Guidance Society of India.
What to take care of
Not suitable against non-alcoholic product Covid-19
Keep sanitizers away from small children
This is because injections can also cause poisoning
Sanitizer is over the counter and requires company name and expiry date
People should read the instructions on the sanitizer carefully

Corona Maharashtra: What is the condition of Jumbo Covid Hospital in Pune?
Jumbo Covid Center Pune
The city and district of Pune became a hotspot for corona infection in the country.
So far, that is, as of this writing, a total of 1 lakh 56 thousand 783 cases have been registered in Pune city, while for the district this number has reached 2 lakh 95 thousand 689.
On the one hand, Pune is the city with the highest number of tests per one lakh population in the country, while on the other hand, it is struggling to build a health system. Pune has a battle against Corona, which is going on day by day.
The first case of covid in the state was reported on March 9 in Pune.
The hospital is located on the grounds of College of Engineering Pune (COEP) in Shivajinagar area of ​​Pune.
Jumbo Covid Center Pune
But the system collapsed, the doctors started to leave, there was a big uproar when bouncers started sitting at the door of the hospital.
Journalist Pandurang Raikar died at the center on September 3 and many questions were raised.
'My brother died due to negligence of the system,' said Pandurang Raikar's sister
We were told by the agency that we are fully prepared.
Our inquiry committee is now giving notice and taking action against them.
We were allowed to go to the command center of this jumbo covid hospital.
The administration claims that everything is fine now and no one is complaining.
But this jumbo hospital in Pune, which started six months after the infection, is still not at full capacity.
The state government has given a week-long deadline to operate 800 beds.
We built 400 beds here.
Last week we brought people by special flight, buses from Kerala, Hyderabad.
Jumbo Covid Center Pune
A good activity can be seen in the facade of this center.
After being admitted to this covid center, the patients lost contact with the outside world.
If someone dies, the situation gets worse.
Dr. Shreyansh Kapale is the head of this Jumbo Covid Hospital.
Even now, I see that about 30 to 40 per cent of the patients come here after their saturation has dropped drastically.
But the question is why the pace at which the numbers were increasing in Pune could not be predicted and why the planning was not done in advance?
It was claimed that the situation was under control and Dimti was told that beds in private hospitals were also available.
According to Shekhar, in the second week of September, he was wandering around the city looking for beds for his aunt and uncle.
We started looking for beds around 11 in the morning and kept searching till night.
Still the situation is no different.
At the time of writing, there are now 4,746 beds available in the city of Pune, according to the Covid Care Center's government dashboard website, but only ICU beds with 31 ventilators.
Despite the municipality claiming to have completed a total of 800 beds, this jumbo hospital in Shivajinagar is stuck at more than half capacity.
Sassoon Hospital
The government is unduly dependent on private hospitals.
Siddharth Shirole is the MLA of Shivajinagar, Pune.
I'm not saying that if you had built it in May, the situation would have been different.
Siddharth Shirole
First of all, it took two and a half months to decide whether we wanted jumbo coveted centers.
Today, Dinanath Mangeshkar Hospital is the best running hospital.
Admittedly, you rushed to build the infrastructure early.
It's been a month since it became a center today.
State Health Minister Rajesh Tope has been visiting the city since the situation in Pune became critical.
Government hospitals like Sassoon have not been used to their full potential, the employed agency has not functioned properly and the main reason is the declining number of doctors needed.
The minus point of Pune is that government beds are scarce, but there are a lot of private beds.
So I personally held a meeting of private hospitals.
Consider one minus point of Pune, the biggest.
On the other hand, Pune's Corona graph is rising faster than any other city and district in the country.
But after June, Samyam was released and by September, Pune had gone beyond two and a half lakhs.
The lockdown was relaxed, processions did not start during Ganeshotsav but crowds were seen on the streets of Pune.
But is there any reason to get infected here faster than other cities?
The climate in Pune is similar to that of swine flu.
Jumbo Covid Center Pune
But at the same time, Pune is the most tested city in the country for every one million population, so they think the numbers are big.
The other part is reporting bias or surveillance bias.
Now if you look, Pune is doing about 95000 tests for every one million population in the state.

Corona: 'Lockdown cuts income for five months, starts online training instead of waiting'
The lockdown, announced to prevent corona infection, has hit many industries.
Considering the financial needs, I started to unlock many things by applying some rules in stages.
No decision has been taken in Maharashtra yet.
Even if clients can't come to you, Krishna Das is one of those who start with new energy once again by finding new ways of how to reach them.
Krishna Das teaches boxing at Ruia College Gymkhana.
It was necessary to start the club when the means of income was off and the nearby savings were exhausted.

Currently, Krishna's academy has 34 students.
While everything was going well, 80 to 90 boys were training in Krishna's boxing club.
I entered Ruia College in 1996. I used to play boxing with one or two of my batchmates at that time.
Why don't you start coaching after watching them play?
We had a good team by 2000.
Before the lockdown was announced, three batches were started in Krishna Das's club.
The club fee is one thousand rupees.
About how these things have changed in online training, Krishna Das said that now we charge a fee of six hundred rupees.
Boxing is a body contact game.
Five-six months of lockdown really went through a lot of trouble.
Two batches of their online training are underway.
But the question is how many days will depend on the online option in a sport like boxing.
'Training online till November'
Upadhyay, who has been a Maharashtra Government's Chhatrapati Award winning athlete and has been working as a rhythmic gymnastics coach since 2004, is currently pursuing the same path of online training.
Varsha Upadhyay started the Premier Rhythmic Gymnastics Academy in 2004.
During February-March last year, Varsha Upadhyay started the first Gymnastics Center of Excellence at the University of Mumbai.
As the prevalence of covid began to increase in Mumbai, Varsha gave classes a fortnight off.
Of course, the question was how much online training is possible in a sport like gymnastics, whether girls can do this training in a small house in Mumbai.
There were small difficulties in taking care of the girls' school hours and setting the time at home.
Varsha Upadhyay also said that considering the current situation, online classes will be taken till November.
'How is online training possible for everyone?'
On the one hand, there is a debate as to whether the fitness industry will take advantage of more and more technology in the post-Kovida period.
Bhushan Pawar, owner of Fitful Fitness Gym in Ghatkopar, said, "We approached the members for online training.
Bhushan's gym has been closed since the last week of March since the lockdown was announced.
Our only source of income is the gym.
Even though the gym is closed, the maintenance of the machines continues.
Even if the gym starts, the cost will be higher than the ERV, says Bhushan.
The gym has to be sanitized first.
Therefore, Bhushan thinks that a decision should be taken to start a gym as soon as possible.

Corona drug: Do not give remedivir to anyone - WHO instructions
The World Health Organization (WHO) has advised that patients with covidia should not be given remedivir, no matter how severe their condition.
Although no effective drug is still available on Covid 19, remedivir has been used to treat critically ill patients from the very beginning.
How effective is remedivir?
Solidarity trials conducted by the WHO in October found that remedivir did little to cure covid patients, prevent their deaths, or reduce their need for a ventilator.
But Gilead Pharmaceuticals, a US-based manufacturer of remedies, rejected the findings.
While approving the use of the drug in the United States, the FDA had said that the drug, remedicivir, sold under the brand name Veclary, reduces the healing rate of covid patients by five days.
The FDA said the drug could be used "in adults as well as in children over 12 years of age and in hospitalized patients weighing at least 40 kg".
US President Donald Trump was also given ramadesivir during treatment after contracting covid.
The FDA said three different clinical trials of the drug had yielded good results.
Use of Remedesivir in Maharashtra
Remadesivir was widely used on covid patients in Maharashtra.
Only then did the director of ICMR, Dr. Balram Bhargava had also said, "Four drugs were tested for remedial treatment.
Now, however, the WHO has made it clear that it does not make sense to use Remedesivir because it does not have sufficient evidence to suggest that it actually works.
But in many parts of the country, including Maharashtra, remedivir is still given to some serious patients.
Speaking to BBC Marathi's Mayank Bhagwat, Maharashtra Covid Task Force member Dr. Shashank Joshi said, "Four months ago, the task force issued instructions to all doctors on the proper use of Remedesivir.
Therefore, the doctor treating the patient should identify and treat the patient whether he / she needs remedivir. "
The use of remedivir in the state has been significantly reduced following the recommendations made by the task force.

Possibility of another lockdown in Maharashtra?
After Diwali, the number of corona patients is increasing in Maharashtra.
Until the first two weeks of November, the number of patients receiving corona free every 24 hours was higher than the number of new patients.
When asked about the lockdown, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said that he would take a decision based on the situation.
On the other hand, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has not spoken clearly about the lockdown, but after Delhi and Gujarat, there may be another wave in Maharashtra, so he has warned to be careful.

5) Non-use of mask - In Maharashtra, if the mask is not used, punitive action has been decided.
6) Ignoring cold-cough - Due to rains and constant change in the weather, the incidence of cold, cough and fever has increased.
7) Do not do RT PCR test - Corona's RT PCR is expected to be tested again after the antigen test is negative.

Crisis again in front of a fighter who continued cleaning with one hand during the Corona period
Bajirao Sathe, a cleaner from Kolhapur Municipal Corporation, who continued to clean with one hand even during the Corona period, is once again facing a big crisis.
Bajirao's finger was injured while cleaning two years ago.
But Bajirao, who is a fighter, is facing a new crisis.
A few days ago, while working, his leg was trampled and then his legs became swollen and he developed a fever.
He is currently undergoing treatment at Chhatrapati Pramila Raje Government Hospital, Kolhapur.

Bajirao is currently undergoing treatment at the CPR Hospital in Kolhapur.
Bajirao has already lost an arm and now he has to stay at home for some more time as he has undergone surgery on both legs.
As Bajirao's wife was blind, he was struggling alone to make ends meet.
In October, BBC Marathi had exposed Bajirao's militancy through the news.
Today we contacted them again.

Rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing similar trends in European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom confirming that, while at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for a surge of patients with COVID-19 who will require healthcare, and in particular intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as being a novel coronavirus now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since, the illness resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date is that ca 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of these recover.
In ca 14% cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe disease requiring hospitalisation while the remaining 6% cases experience critical illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality of patients hospitalised due to COVID-19 is ca 4%.
In this study, we assess the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them to that of Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with that in Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Subsequent to China, COVID-19 underwent further geographical spread and the dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follows that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the 5 March issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As at 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), whereby between 31 December 2019 and that date included, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Obtaining cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the notified COVID-19 case counts in each country worldwide, obtained from only official sources such as the countries’ Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and the WHO, are updated each day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used for assessing the trends of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and the UK, and comparing them to that in Italy.
As a proxy of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the 1 January–15 March 2020 period.
We also presented the cumulative number of notified cases of each country as at 15 March 2020 8:00 a.m. compared with that of Italy for the 31 January–15 March 2020 period.
Trends of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trends in the 14-day truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK overall, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 started to increase around 21 February and then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (Supplementary material).
This was mostly driven by the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar increasing trends of the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (Supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases, in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared with that in Italy for the 31 January–15 March 2020 period.
It highlights that, as at 15 March 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy just 3 weeks prior or less.
Our results indicate that the number of notified cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable speed in all countries.
This is despite countries being at different stages, variations in national public health responses, and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for selecting patients that must be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including catch-up testing.
Early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which ca 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 cases in a hospital and/or an intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% cases, respectively (data not shown).
They should, however, be collected in a systematic fashion to complement current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study performed in 2010–11 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010–11).
Modelling scenarios related to healthcare capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of hospitalised COVID-19 cases associated with a &gt; 90% risk of exceeding intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since cases have so far clustered in certain regions in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve a defined regional catchment population, information about cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level.
The experience from Italy and the current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should thus prepare themselves for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring healthcare, and in particular intensive care, such as the one occurring in the affected regions of Italy.
As pointed out in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, with a shift from a containment to a mitigation approach, as the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide decision makers and hospitals enough time to comprehend, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented ahead of time.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to further increase their control efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and decrease the pressure on healthcare.
Failing this, it is likely that the healthcare systems of other EU/EEA countries will face a surge of patients that require intensive care within the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has thus far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in catastrophe for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 might also be transmitted from the bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS but is much more transmissive and affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the swiftly developing research subject.
We will cover the basics about the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions still require answers, we hope that this review helps in the understanding and eradication of the threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory to all Chinese who were urged to stay indoors for all the holiday and for many weeks after due to the outbreak of a novel viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the entire country and to near 50 others all over the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in over 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and over 3,000 patients who died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “public enemy number 1” and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, over 200 papers have been published on COVID-19 including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020 that determined the sequence of the virus isolated from multiple patients.
This review attempts to summarize the research progress in the new and swiftly developing subject area.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-caused disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far regarding the prevention and prognosis of the disease as well as some remaining yet urgent questions.
CoVs have been traditionally considered nonlethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing approximately 15% of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have encountered highly pathogenic human CoVs twice, i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak originally in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with horrible morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in the recorded history of humans.
As shown in Fig. ​Fig.1,1, clusters of pneumonia that had unknown origins were first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later the sequence of the CoV was released.
On January 15, 2020 the first fatal case from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic rapidly spread to the neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, the infection of health-care providers was reported, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was locked down with all its public transportation stopped.
On January 24 the first clinical study on the disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market that was considered the starting site of the infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and near 50 other countries all over the world (Fig. ​(Fig.2).2).
As the situation is rapidly evolving, the final scope and severity of the outbreak remain to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-center study on 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients presented a more updated illustration of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly at the age of 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected individuals were over 50 years old, very few were under 20, and only 14 infected individuals were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 expanded in clusters mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 Jan. 2020, matching the time of massive transportation before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all the patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three major risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and enveloped viruses containing a single strand of sense RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms virion-containing vesicles, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples collected from the original site of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Through transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultrathin sections of human airway epithelium.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 more weakly than that of SARS-CoV, which is coincident with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a novel short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 Å resolution in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which provides evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and intermediate host
It has been known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via civet cats and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered the native host of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, what intermediate host helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the transmission route is yet to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as a carrier of the virus from bats to humans which involved homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins - long-snouted, ant-eating mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are the potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology in a CoV discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, 1% difference spread all over two genomes is still a big difference; thus, conclusive results for concrete evidence are awaited (Fig. ​(Fig.33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely not yet known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days under 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may possess similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The entire human population generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and hence is susceptible to the novel virus.
Currently, no detailed study has been reported regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. ​(Fig.4).4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, maturation of dendritic cells, and synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) which limit the spreading of the virus and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape from the immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in the defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help the defending cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell functions by inducing apoptosis of T cells.
The humoral immunity including complements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies is also essential in combating the viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system generates a large number of free radicals locally that can cause severe damages to the lungs and other organs, and, in the worst scenario, multi-organ failure and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, featured by clustering onset, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common that for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised, they have higher chance to be infected than others.
The estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study on 1,099 cases demonstrates that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, demonstrates that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on the demography of 8,866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing infected but symptomless people from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, individuals exposed to, or infected by, the virus are usually required to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the major and initial symptom of COVID-19, which can be accompanied by no symptom or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle ache, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients quickly progressed to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December of 2019 showed that the percentages of the symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of the patients required ventilation support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family cluster and a cluster caused by transmission from an asymptomatic individual.
Comparably, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with the higher lethality of MERS than of COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed with MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it has been demonstrated that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were the major symptoms and ventilation support was required for approximately 14%-20% of the patients.
By February 14, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2% when the confirmed cases reached 66,576 globally.
Comparably, the mortality of SARS by November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, the mortality was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
An earlier study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, whereas the R0 of SARS-CoV only ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV regarding their symptoms, mortality, and R0 is presented in Table ​Table1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the latter two.
Thus, it is much more challenging to control the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Clustered onset often happens in the same family or from the same gathering or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected individuals or patients in the recent two weeks before the onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms longer than two weeks and cured patients discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again, which sends out an alarm to increase the time for quarantine.
Patients have normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) at the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count &lt; 4×109/L including lymphocyte count &lt; 1×109/L, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product present in the blood, was elevated, and lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.
Abnormalities in chest radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and featured by bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop an atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS happens, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis severely compromise the gas exchange.
Dysfunction of type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases the surfactant level and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and heightening the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the worst chest radiographic findings often parallel the most severe extent of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the desquamation of pneumocytes, hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and similar to that of SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the major criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations started to be used for diagnosis (which no longer solely relied on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and imperative for making an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol of using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a dipstick in less than an hour without requiring elaborate instrumentation.
Hopefully, the new technique can dramatically enhance the sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the novel CoV, physicians can mainly provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while attempting a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table ​(Table2).2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients was proposed to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs in the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the major threat to the patients and the major cause of death.
Thus, respiratory support is critical to relieve the symptoms and save lives and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms have to be supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of life-threatening cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infection and septic shock, and the protection of the functions of the vital organs are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been known that a cytokine storm results from an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response featured by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a vast number of free radicals which are the major cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storm include the modulation of T cell-directed immune response; the blockade of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; suppressor of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids at high dosages were not beneficial to severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they may cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting the prognosis.
Nevertheless, short courses of corticosteroids at low-to-moderate doses have been recommended to be used prudently for critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, has been found to be efficacious in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also demonstrated possible inhibition of other single stranded RNA viruses including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to conduct a pair of trials on SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other adverse reactions can occur following combined therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in the patients should be monitored carefully.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation
The collection of the blood from patients who recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from catching the disease has a long history.
Indeed, recovered patients often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects and they recognize unique molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and was injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral loads and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to propose the method for large-scale use before specific therapies are not yet developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with the plasma should be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially a life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for the plasma is large to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies rapidly enough to fight against a global epidemic.
Thus, it is more critical and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes encoding effective antibodies or screen for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
This way, we can readily scale up the production of the antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects largely rely on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of TCM.
Most of the effective components remain unknown or are vague as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the major alternative treatments for patients with light to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for COVID-19 treatment.
Top cure rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), whereas Hubei province, which used TCM in only approximately 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is quite a rough comparison as many other impact factors such as the number and severity of the patients should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and coworkers published a study to compare western medicine (WM) treatment alone with combined treatment of WM and TCM.
They found that the times needed for body temperature recovery, symptom disappearance, and hospitalization were remarkably shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM only group.
Most impressively, the rate for symptomatic worsening (from light to severe) was remarkably lower for the WM+TCM group than for the WM only group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality was lower in the WM+TCM group than WM only group (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of TCM still await more well-controlled trials at larger scales and in more centers.
It would also be intriguing to characterize the mechanism of actions and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 mostly experience great fear of the highly contagious and even fatal disease, and quarantined people also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Furthermore, symptoms of the infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well as adverse effects of the treatments such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychiatric morbidities including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidality were reported.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as a part of the public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of the contagion, quarantine, and stigma on their families and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals, and people in contact with them as well as the general public who are in need.
The psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential for interrupting the chain of transmission from animal reservoirs and infected humans to susceptible hosts and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate long-term and potent neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in elderly individuals and lethal-challenge models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection have yet to be determined before a clinical study is initiated.
This is probably because SARS died down 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and clusters of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions owing to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS by using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task for controlling the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome the difficulty because of the long period of time (averaged 18 months) needed for vaccine development and the dynamic variations of CoVs.
As a novel disease, COVID-19 has just started to manifest its full clinical course throughout thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without sequelae.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health-care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-constrained areas.
Based on clinical studies reported thus far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table ​(Table33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly happened at the age of 30-65 with 47.7% of those patients being over 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly older than those who did not (at the median age of 66 versus 51), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main reason for death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which might lead to liver dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease are strongly correlated and might interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The C-reactive protein (CRP) level in blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed to be a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and ultimate recovery.
The correlation of CRP level to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are expressed extensively in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, they are traditional markers for heart or liver dysfunctions.
Major clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with the other issues for the prediction of outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressant commonly used as an adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since a high dosage of corticosteroids was widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis with life-long disability and poor life quality.
Thus, if needed, steroids should be used at low dosage and for a short time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients have suffered from extraordinary stress as they often endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients.
It is imperative to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from the stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological features from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and causes mild or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, infected patients at the early phase or incubation period can produce a large amount of virus during daily activities, causing great difficulty for the control of the epidemic.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when the patients are severely ill, while most transmission did not happen at the early phase.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
Great efforts are currently underway in China including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and continuous quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have been dramatically damaging the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating the slowdown of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the downswing phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not that optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which seems substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both mid-turbinate and throat swabs of patients who recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, which indicates that the newly identified virus could become a cyclical episode similar to influenza.
However, promising signs have occurred in China based on the declining number of new cases, indicating the current strategies might have been working.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, via strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has eventually been put under control.
It is possible, similar to SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 might become weaker in infectivity and eventually die down or become a less pathogenic virus co-existent with humans.
A comparison of the epidemic of COVID-19 with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. ​(Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmittable through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, which raises a new possibility of feces-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study on 138 cases reported that 41% of the cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with other prior diseases and 40 health-care providers.
Thus, great precaution should be used to protect humans, especially health-care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even bystanders in contact with patients or infected people.
The first line of defense that could be used to lower the risk of infection is through wearing face masks; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series # 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent liquid droplets from a potentially infected individual from traveling through the air or sticking onto surfaces of materials, where they could be passed on to others.
However, only N95 (series # 1860s) masks can protect against the inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions being able to penetrate completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both are approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked together, health-care providers in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (series # 1860s) masks but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health-care providers should wear fitted isolation gowns in order to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 although he wore an N95 mask; the virus might have entered his body through his inflammatory eyes.
Thus, health-care providers should also wear transparent face shields or goggles while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly suggested that everybody wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual, try to stay indoors for self-quarantine and limit contact with potentially infected individuals.
Three feet is considered an appropriate distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to lower the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, its high homology to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 should have caused high alert to China based on her deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, not until 19 January 2020 did the director of the Center of Disease Control of Wuhan comfort the citizens by saying that the novel virus has low contagiousness and limited reproductivity from human to human and that it is not a problem to prevent and contain the disease.
This message remarkably relaxed the alarm of the public, especially when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical time was missed to contain the disease at its minimal scale in Wuhan.
The disease control agencies in China may take this hard lesson and make critical improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more careful when making public announcements as every word counts to citizens and can change their attitude and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic at its early stage rather than attempting to comfort the public; and (4) more often to issue targeted and effective drills to increase the public's awareness about epidemic diseases and to test and improve the response system of the society periodically.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 started in the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread all over China and near 50 other countries globally at the time of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a sense of SARS recurring.
However, there are some remarkable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for containing the epidemic and treating the patients.
COVID-19 affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women, and the severity and death rate are also higher in elderly individual than in youth.
SARS has higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are symptomless whereas SARS patients do so usually when they are severely ill, which causes much greater difficulty to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and broader than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA assay for SARS-CoV-2 can be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, cured patients can be positive for the virus again.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of virus spreading.
Given such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, several critical issues remain to be solved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homolog was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species to transmit the virus from the original host, say bats, to humans?
Without knowing answers to #1 and 2, we cannot efficiently cut the transmission, and the outbreak can relapse at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assays have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the airway cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind ACE2-expressing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus genetically evolving during transmission among humans?
Will it become a pandemic worldwide, die down like SARS or relapse periodically like the flu?
It is essential but may take some time to search for answers to the above and many other questions.
However, with whatever expense it may demand, we have no other choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and bring our life back to normal.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection could be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrusted CoVs into the spotlight again and surprised us with its high transmissibility but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs would serve us well.
Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
Identifying the animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
Investigating CoV-host interactions in animals might also derive important insight on CoV pathogenesis in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compare and contrast the different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host switches and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which comprises a group of enveloped, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses harbouring the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases amongst RNA viruses were termed “CoVs” because of their crown-like morphology under electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have non-segmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contain two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
The polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, designated nsp1~16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for the structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different lineages of CoVs.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), among which the beta-CoV genera contains most HCoVs and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as the gene source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have constantly crossed species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, like common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly-identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infection in relatively more patients with a higher chance to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from the nasal discharge of patients with common cold in mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge was accumulated through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
Indeed, the concept had been widely accepted that infection with HCoVs is generally harmless until the outbreak of SARS.
The SARS outbreak occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in current history, infecting over 8,000 people with a crude case fatality of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spreading to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), which has subsequently been renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been ringing and the world has to prepare for the coming pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoVs have a zoonotic origin from bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence support an evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has presented enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework to understand the natural history, driving force and restriction factors of species jumping.
This might also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediate and amplifying animal host(s) of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in the prevention of future spillovers.
In this review we present an overview of the zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
Particularly, we highlight and discuss the common theme that parental viruses of HCoVs are typically non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also review the trend of HCoV evolution in which the increase in transmissibility often comes with the decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since late 1930s.
Before the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from the nasal discharge of patients who had contracted common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in various infected animals, including turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table ​1) would be informative and instructive.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in the year of 1966, and was subsequently adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E presented with common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore-throat, with fever and cough seen in 10~20% cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in brains of suckling mice.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection with other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, and they tend to be predominantly transmitted during the season of winter in temperate climate.
Generally, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by an approximately 2-week illness.
According to a human volunteer study, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients exhibited severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as “atypical pneumonia”, was the first well documented HCoV-caused pandemic in human history and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province of China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spreading across many countries and continents.
Apart from the super-spreaders, it was estimated that each case could give rise to approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the peak of viral load appearing on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially present with myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, deranged liver function tests, and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and an increase of macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory tract, multiple organs including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can also be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied with a cytokine storm, which might be lethal particularly in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open lung biopsy of a relative of the index patient who travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands during late 2004.
It was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory illnesses.
Presentation of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen from an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in Netherlands, it is actually distributed globally.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs during early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Besides community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute asthmatic exacerbation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All these four community-acquired HCoVs have been well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, though accidents did occur for unknown reasons as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the abilities to transmit efficiently and to maintain themselves continuously within humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Whereas most of the laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spreads to close contacts have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
Clinical manifestations of MERS resemble those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which is thus far unique for MERS among HCoV-caused diseases.
More than 30% of patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, over 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high case fatality of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to humans.
During middle to late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia patients retrospectively known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a crude case fatality of 3.4%.
Notably, the case fatality in Hubei, China is 4.2%, whereas the one outside of it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, presented as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Diarrhea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they cluster into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and might contribute to its rapid spreading around the world.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great interest.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features that are more commonly seen during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including the presentation of non-specific, mild or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is a bit lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passages in humans as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, same as the other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role as in the case of SARS-CoV at least under some circumstance remains to be clarified by future studies.
It is also of particularly great interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 might exhibit seasonality as in the cases of community-acquired HCoVs.
Nevertheless, the features of SARS-CoV-2 including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spreading after passages in humans will be influential on the ultimate fate of the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.
All four community-acquired HCoVs causing mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it might also be true that humans have been well adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be the survivors of ancient HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans who developed severe HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs have to replicate in humans to sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people that it infects, the greater chance that it will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired CoVs circulate in human populations, triggering common cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well and their transmission within humans cannot be sustained.
They need to maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the chance to spillover to susceptible human targets, possibly via one or more intermediate and amplifying hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has features that are similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
It is highly transmissible like community-acquired HCoVs, at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will adapt fully to humans and circulate within humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it will serve us well to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifying hosts of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it harbours a closely related ancestor sharing high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.
Likewise, a reservoir host harbours HCoV continuously and for long term.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of HCoV or its parental virus.
In contrast, if the HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host right before or around its introduction to humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an amplifying host by allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmitting it to humans to amplify the scale of human infection.
An HCoV can undergo a dead-end infection if it cannot sustain its transmission within the intermediate host.
On the contrary, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the index case of SARS had a contact history with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared with that of the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a racoon dog in live animal markets were first identified to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was reported after killing all civets in the markets.
However, it has been reported that masked palm civets from the wild or farms without exposure to the live animal markets were largely negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets might only serve as the intermediate amplifying host but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that multiple species of small mammals might also serve as intermediate amplifying hosts of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All of these appear to be dead-end hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV unveiled a closely related bat CoV, termed SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats host emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none except for one designated WIV1 can be isolated as live virus.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the receptor of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 derived from fecal sample of bats was demonstrated to use bat, civet and human ACE2 as receptor for cell entry.
Intriguingly, sera of convalescent SARS patients were capable of neutralizing WIV1.
Thus far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Albeit the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis clusters MERS-CoV to the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV utilize the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to counterparts in bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
Up to now, no live MERS-CoV can be found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% nucleotide sequence homology.
Thus, bats might not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in Middle East have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, same as camels of Middle East origin in multiple African countries.
Live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal swabs of dromedary camels, further indicating that camels serve as the bona fide reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that generally mild symptoms but massive virus shedding were observed in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
Notably, infected camels shed viruses not only through respiratory route but also through fecal-oral route, which is also the main route for virus shedding from bats.
However, questions still remain since many confirmed cases of MERS have no contact history with camels prior to symptom onset, plausibly ascribed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unrecognized animal species that harbour MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat CoV RaTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to assign parental relationship.
That is to say, bats might not be the immediate reservoir host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical bat CoVs are found in future.
Presumably, the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wildlife species sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicative of a probable animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also harbour ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These novel pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with about 90% identity at the level of nucleotide sequence.
They cluster into two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which share a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In stark contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, albeit a higher degree of sequence homology genome-wide.
An earlier study on diseased pangolins also reported the detection of viral contigs from lung samples, which turn out to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different assembly methods and manual curation to generate a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, currently there is no evidence in support of a direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains to be established.
Whereas the highest sequence homology has been found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest genome-wide sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selectivity-mediated convergent evolution.
A counter-proposal is in favour of a recombination between a pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-CoVs.
The jury is still out on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Besides the highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E might have originated from bat CoVs, while the parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It has been reported that a bat CoV termed ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American tricolored bat displayed close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, termed Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, while camelids have also been suspected as its intermediate host.
For clarity, the current knowledge on animal origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure ​1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of HCoVs in the history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The interspecies transmission history of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Bat alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Between them there is an alpaca alpha-CoV.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans but not alpacas might have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-CoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas alpaca alpha-CoV caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in feral animals.
Thus, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas obtain the HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not too surprising that bats might transmit HCoV-229E to humans directly.
Alternatively, whereas bat alpha-CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels might serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known at its initial identification and has also been strengthened by subsequent findings.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, densely packed colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly are all favourable conditions for bats to be an ideal'virus spreader'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary camels for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels that have turned from an intermediate host to a stable and natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a dead-end host of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if there is any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
Particularly, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They might be a dead-end host for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have to be ruled in or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans might share the ecological niche with bats through butchering or coal mining.
Second, pangolins could be one of intermediate amplifying host to which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had been newly introduced.
Humans contract the virus through butchering and consumption of game meat.
It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is warranted.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 might have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still on.
Apart from different types of the animal hosts, three major factors on the viral side are also important in facilitating CoVs to cross species barriers.
First of all, their relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication.
In comparison to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs could be regarded as “moderate” to “high” with an average substitution rate being ~10-4 substitution per year per site 2, depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to novel hosts.
CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease, deletion of which results in exceedingly high mutability and attenuation or even inviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication through inhibition of this exoribonuclease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, mutation rates of CoVs are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, mutation rate is often high when CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggestive of a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, it has already been adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedary camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic drift would render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective quickly.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs exerts extra plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination, thereby increasing the probability for interspecies co-evolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of novel CoVs when the conditions become appropriate.
This is supported by the copious unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, CoVs randomly and frequently switch templates during RNA replication through a unique “copy-choice” mechanism.
In a host that serves as the mixing vessel, strand switching occurs frequently during CoV RNA transcription.
Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNAs could recombine to generate new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
Besides three viral factors stated above, viral interaction with host receptor is another key factor influential on interspecies transmission.
Herein, recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between isolates of human and civet SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, particularly with mutations at the RBD of the S protein.
Generally, the RBD in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensely selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acids on the S1 fragment, which binds to the human ACE2 as well as its coreceptors for viral entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of recognizing the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bat, civet, mouse and raccoon dog, allowing interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to be different from human and civet viral isolates in the RBD and 4 of them locate in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which might increase the affinity of the interaction of spike protein with human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions might be critical to viral adaption to humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein implicates that the binding affinity of its S protein with human ACE2 might have altered.
Indeed, a cryo-EM study indicates a 10- to 20-fold higher affinity of this binding than that between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other coreceptor might be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Intriguingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of S.
There exist many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They might also account for successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other host dependency and restriction factors.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedary camels and rodents might constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs have to usurp host dependency factors and subvert host restriction factors for a successful interspecies transmission.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction remain to be identified and characterized.
An unbiased genome-wide screening of host dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the state-of-the-art technology of CRISPR might be fruitful.
Emergence of novel HCoVs: back to ground zero
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been thought to be important in adaptation to humans, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoVs has been found in strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the switch of hosts.
Besides, SARS-CoV has a possible recombination history with lineages of alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination locations were also identified in the nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Likewise, it has been shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV experienced recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which the HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be cautioned that artificial selection can contribute to unintended changes in viral genomes, most likely resulting from relieving viruses from selection pressures exerted, such as by the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, owing to a two-nucleotide deletion.
While intact ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca alpha-CoV displays a single nucleotide insertion, resulting in a frameshift.
Last but not least, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating the mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It appeared that bats are well adapted to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
Besides, the natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to upregulation of inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and low expression level of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules.
Moreover, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affects proofreading by exoribonuclease, thus providing the selection pressure for the generation of virus strains highly pathogenic when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains might also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of novel proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
Thus, it is not by chance that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate robustly without eliciting a strong host immune response.
Herein lie the secrets of why asymptomatic carriers are seen and what causes the severe cases in human infection.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of immune response and the cytokine storm wherein the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been de-coupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy of delinking the immune response might have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bats is defective.
By this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 might be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV arose.
Whereas a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been found, there also exists a bat-CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Whereas civets and other animals in the markets have been found to harbour viruses identical to SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs strikingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, indicating that pangolins might serve as one of intermediate hosts or pangolin beta-CoVs could contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made either deliberately or accidentally.
CoVs have returned to the limelight due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has drastically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human transmission.
Pervasive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a bat origin and are transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originates from the contact between humans and civets in the markets, closing wet markets and killing civets therein could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
By the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in view of the discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remain to be clarified in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in dromedary camels for a long time.
These camels serve as an important tool for transportation as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local people.
They are widely distributed across the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as what was done in wild animal markets in China to prevent the spreading of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
As we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes might emerge to cause outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs are circulating in the wild.
Particularly, bat CoVs with zoonotic potential are so diverse.
There are plenty of opportunities that these zoonotic CoVs evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or deadly in humans in future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the ordeals of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed in the planet for a very long time.
They stay in their own natural reservoirs until there is a chance for spillover.
Although bats have many features that favours the spreading of viruses, the chance for humans to be in contact with bats and other wildlife species can be minimized if people are educated to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance in mammals is necessary for better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for humans to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of the zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it will be of interest to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, how humans get into contact with bats should be determined.
Third, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, how it interacts with the different species including humans, bats and pangolins has to be clarified.
Finally, since many mammals including domestic animals might be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be conducted.
Should it be a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical will be identified in its natural hosts in future.
Continued investigations in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Preliminary Estimates of the Prevalence of Selected Underlying Health Conditions Among Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 — United States, February 12–March 28, 2020
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic.
As of March 28, 2020, a total of 571,678 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 26,494 deaths have been reported worldwide.
Reports from China and Italy suggest that risk factors for severe disease include older age and the presence of at least one of several underlying health conditions.
U.S. older adults, including those aged ≥65 years and particularly those aged ≥85 years, also appear to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19–associated outcomes; however, data describing underlying health conditions among U.S. COVID-19 patients have not yet been reported.
As of March 28, 2020, U.S. states and territories have reported 122,653 U.S. COVID-19 cases to CDC, including 7,162 (5.8%) for whom data on underlying health conditions and other known risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections were reported.
Among these 7,162 cases, 2,692 (37.6%) patients had one or more underlying health condition or risk factor, and 4,470 (62.4%) had none of these conditions reported.
The percentage of COVID-19 patients with at least one underlying health condition or risk factor was higher among those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission (358 of 457, 78%) and those requiring hospitalization without ICU admission (732 of 1,037, 71%) than that among those who were not hospitalized (1,388 of 5,143, 27%).
The most commonly reported conditions were diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, and cardiovascular disease.
These preliminary findings suggest that in the United States, persons with underlying health conditions or other recognized risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections appear to be at a higher risk for severe disease from COVID-19 than are persons without these conditions.
Data from laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to CDC from 50 states, four U.S. territories and affiliated islands, the District of Columbia, and New York City with February 12–March 28, 2020 onset dates were analyzed.
Cases among persons repatriated to the United States from Wuhan, China, and the Diamond Princess cruise ship were excluded.
For cases with missing onset dates, date of onset was estimated by subtracting 4 days (median interval from symptom onset to specimen collection date among cases with known dates in these data) from the earliest specimen collection.
Public health departments reported cases to CDC using a standardized case report form that captures information (yes, no, or unknown) on the following conditions and potential risk factors: chronic lung disease (inclusive of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], and emphysema); diabetes mellitus; cardiovascular disease; chronic renal disease; chronic liver disease; immunocompromised condition; neurologic disorder, neurodevelopmental, or intellectual disability; pregnancy; current smoking status; former smoking status; or other chronic disease.
Data reported to CDC are preliminary and can be updated by health departments over time; critical data elements might be missing at the time of initial report; thus, this analysis is descriptive, and no statistical comparisons could be made.
The percentages of patients of all ages with underlying health conditions who were not hospitalized, hospitalized without ICU admission, and hospitalized with ICU admission were calculated.
Percentages of hospitalizations with and without ICU admission were estimated for persons aged ≥19 years with and without underlying health conditions.
This part of the analysis was limited to persons aged ≥19 years because of the small sample size of cases in children with reported underlying health conditions (N = 32).
To account for missing data among these preliminary reports, ranges were estimated with a lower bound including cases with both known and unknown status for hospitalization with and without ICU admission as the denominator and an upper bound using only cases with known outcome status as the denominator.
Because of small sample size and missing data on underlying health conditions among COVID-19 patients who died, case-fatality rates for persons with and without underlying conditions were not estimated.
As of March 28, 2020, a total of 122,653 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases (Figure) and 2,112 deaths were reported to CDC.
Case report forms were submitted to CDC for 74,439 (60.7%) cases.
Data on presence or absence of underlying health conditions and other recognized risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections (i.e., smoking and pregnancy) were available for 7,162 (5.8%) patients (Table 1).
Approximately one third of these patients (2,692, 37.6%), had at least one underlying condition or risk factor.
Diabetes mellitus (784, 10.9%), chronic lung disease (656, 9.2%), and cardiovascular disease (647, 9.0%) were the most frequently reported conditions among all cases.
Among 457 ICU admissions and 1,037 non-ICU hospitalizations, 358 (78%) and 732 (71%), respectively occurred among persons with one or more reported underlying health condition.
In contrast, 1,388 of 5,143 (27%) COVID-19 patients who were not hospitalized were reported to have at least one underlying health condition.
Among patients aged ≥19 years, the percentage of non-ICU hospitalizations was higher among those with underlying health conditions (27.3%–29.8%) than among those without underlying health conditions (7.2%–7.8%); the percentage of cases that resulted in an ICU admission was also higher for those with underlying health conditions (13.3%–14.5%) than those without these conditions (2.2%–2.4%) (Table 2).
Small numbers of COVID-19 patients aged &lt; 19 years were reported to be hospitalized (48) or admitted to an ICU (eight).
In contrast, 335 patients aged &lt; 19 years were not hospitalized and 1,342 had missing data on hospitalization.
Among all COVID-19 patients with complete information on underlying conditions or risk factors, 184 deaths occurred (all among patients aged ≥19 years); 173 deaths (94%) were reported among patients with at least one underlying condition.
Among 122,653 U.S. COVID-19 cases reported to CDC as of March 28, 2020, 7,162 (5.8%) patients had data available pertaining to underlying health conditions or potential risk factors; among these patients, higher percentages of patients with underlying conditions were admitted to the hospital and to an ICU than patients without reported underlying conditions.
These results are consistent with findings from China and Italy, which suggest that patients with underlying health conditions and risk factors, including, but not limited to, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, COPD, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic renal disease, and smoking, might be at higher risk for severe disease or death from COVID-19.
This analysis was limited by small numbers and missing data because of the burden placed on reporting health departments with rapidly rising case counts, and these findings might change as additional data become available.
It is not yet known whether the severity or level of control of underlying health conditions affects the risk for severe disease associated with COVID-19.
Many of these underlying health conditions are common in the United States: based on self-reported 2018 data, the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes among U.S. adults was 10.1%, and the U.S. age-adjusted prevalence of all types of heart disease (excluding hypertension without other heart disease) was 10.6% in 2017.
The age-adjusted prevalence of COPD among U.S. adults is 5.9%, and in 2018, the U.S. estimated prevalence of current asthma among persons of all ages was 7.9%.
CDC continues to develop and update resources for persons with underlying health conditions to reduce the risk of acquiring COVID-19.
The estimated higher prevalence of these conditions among those in this early group of U.S. COVID-19 patients and the potentially higher risk for more severe disease from COVID-19 associated with the presence of underlying conditions highlight the importance of COVID-19 prevention in persons with underlying conditions.
The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations.
First, these data are preliminary, and the analysis was limited by missing data related to the health department reporting burden associated with rapidly rising case counts and delays in completion of information requiring medical chart review; these findings might change as additional data become available.
Information on underlying conditions was only available for 7,162 (5.8%) of 122,653 cases reported to CDC.
It cannot be assumed that those with missing information are similar to those with data on either hospitalizations or underlying health conditions.
Second, these data are subject to bias in outcome ascertainment because of short follow-up time.
Some outcomes might be underestimated, and long-term outcomes cannot be assessed in this analysis.
Third, because of the limited availability of testing in many jurisdictions during this period, this analysis is likely biased toward more severe cases, and findings might change as testing becomes more widespread.
Fourth, because of the descriptive nature of these data, attack rates among persons with and without underlying health conditions could not be compared, and thus the risk difference of severe disease with COVID-19 between these groups could not be estimated.
Fifth, no conclusions could be drawn about underlying conditions that were not included in the case report form or about different conditions that were reported in a single, umbrella category.
For example, asthma and COPD were included in a chronic lung disease category.
Finally, for some underlying health conditions and risk factors, including neurologic disorders, chronic liver disease, being a current smoker, and pregnancy, few severe outcomes were reported; therefore, conclusions cannot be drawn about the risk for severe COVID-19 among persons in these groups.
Persons in the United States with underlying health conditions appear to be at higher risk for more severe COVID-19, consistent with findings from other countries.
Persons with underlying health conditions who have symptoms of COVID-19, including fever, cough, or shortness of breath, should immediately contact their health care provider.
These persons should take steps to protect themselves from COVID-19, through washing their hands; cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces; and social distancing, including staying at home, avoiding crowds, gatherings, and travel, and avoiding contact with persons who are ill.
Maintaining at least a 30-day supply of medication, a 2-week supply of food and other necessities, and knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms are recommended for those with underlying health conditions.
All persons should take steps to protect themselves from COVID-19 and to protect others.
All persons who are ill should stay home, except to get medical care; should not go to work; and should stay away from others.
This is especially important for those who work with persons with underlying conditions or who otherwise are at high risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19.
Community mitigation strategies, which aim to slow the spread of COVID-19, are important to protect all persons from COVID-19, especially persons with underlying health conditions and other persons at risk for severe COVID-19–associated disease (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf).
What is already known about this topic?
Published reports from China and Italy suggest that risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease include underlying health conditions, but data describing underlying health conditions among U.S. COVID-19 patients have not yet been reported.
What is added by this report?
Based on preliminary U.S. data, persons with underlying health conditions such as diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, and cardiovascular disease, appear to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19–associated disease than persons without these conditions.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Strategies to protect all persons and especially those with underlying health conditions, including social distancing and handwashing, should be implemented by all communities and all persons to help slow the spread of COVID-19.
Emergence of a Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19): Protocol for Extending Surveillance Used by the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre and Public Health England
The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) and Public Health England (PHE) have successfully worked together on the surveillance of influenza and other infectious diseases for over 50 years, including three previous pandemics.
With the emergence of the international outbreak of the coronavirus infection (COVID-19), a UK national approach to containment has been established to test people suspected of exposure to COVID-19.
At the same time and separately, the RCGP RSC’s surveillance has been extended to monitor the temporal and geographical distribution of COVID-19 infection in the community as well as assess the effectiveness of the containment strategy.
The aims of this study are to surveil COVID-19 in both asymptomatic populations and ambulatory cases with respiratory infections, ascertain both the rate and pattern of COVID-19 spread, and assess the effectiveness of the containment policy.
The RCGP RSC, a network of over 500 general practices in England, extract pseudonymized data weekly.
This extended surveillance comprises of five components: (1) Recording in medical records of anyone suspected to have or who has been exposed to COVID-19.
Computerized medical records suppliers have within a week of request created new codes to support this.
(2) Extension of current virological surveillance and testing people with influenza-like illness or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI)—with the caveat that people suspected to have or who have been exposed to COVID-19 should be referred to the national containment pathway and not seen in primary care.
(3) Serology sample collection across all age groups.
This will be an extra blood sample taken from people who are attending their general practice for a scheduled blood test.
The 100 general practices currently undertaking annual influenza virology surveillance will be involved in the extended virological and serological surveillance.
(4) Collecting convalescent serum samples.
We have the opportunity to escalate the data extraction to twice weekly if needed.
Swabs and sera will be analyzed in PHE reference laboratories.
General practice clinical system providers have introduced an emergency new set of clinical codes to support COVID-19 surveillance.
Additionally, practices participating in current virology surveillance are now taking samples for COVID-19 surveillance from low-risk patients presenting with LRTIs.
Within the first 2 weeks of setup of this surveillance, we have identified 3 cases: 1 through the new coding system, the other 2 through the extended virology sampling.
We have rapidly converted the established national RCGP RSC influenza surveillance system into one that can test the effectiveness of the COVID-19 containment policy.
The extended surveillance has already seen the use of new codes with 3 cases reported.
Rapid sharing of this protocol should enable scientific critique and shared learning.
The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) is a network of general practices (GPs) with a nationally representative population that provides pseudonymized data for weekly surveillance of infectious diseases.
The disease surveillance program is commissioned by Public Health England (PHE) and covers 37 infectious diseases, including influenza.
The RCGP RSC and PHE have an established collaboration of over 50 years in influenza and respiratory disease surveillance and are now in their 53rd season of surveillance and analysis.
The RCGP RSC extracts pseudonymized data from a nationally representative sample of over 500 urban and nonurban GPs each week covering a population of over 4 million.
Data from these practices are reported online in a weekly return, which includes monitoring weekly rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) and other communicable and respiratory diseases in England.
We also produce an annual report.
The RCGP RSC data set includes all coded data and all prescribed items including vaccine exposure.
The RCGP RSC conducts virology surveillance each influenza season, with 100 GPs participating in the 2019-2020 season (Figure 1).
These virology sampling practices are also recruited to be nationally representative (Figure 1).
GPs take nasopharyngeal swabs from persons showing acute respiratory illness within 7 days of the onset of symptoms.
Nasopharyngeal swabs are taken from children younger than 5 years showing symptoms of acute bronchitis or bronchiolitis.
Additionally, nasopharyngeal samples are taken from anyone 5 years and older showing acute onset of ILI and respiratory synctial virus.
Swabs are tested at the PHE Respiratory Virus Unit for influenza to monitor positivity rates and circulating strains, as well as for measuring vaccine effectiveness.
The RCGP RSC successfully conducted a pilot collecting serological samples from adults and linking them to a patient’s medical records during the 2018-2019 influenza season.
This pilot was in collaboration with the PHE Seroepidemiology Unit and added to the residual blood samples submitted to PHE by National Health Service (NHS) laboratories.
Serology can provide important information about background population immunity, and sentinel networks can provide a mechanism for systematic data collection and linkage to medical records and health outcomes.
The serology pilot has demonstrated the ability of the network to collect serology samples in adults.
With the COVID-19 outbreak, PHE and RCGP RSC have adapted existing influenza surveillance to monitor the spread of COVID-19 in the community, and this protocol sets out the basis for that collaboration.
The primary national strategy for COVID-19 infection is containment, with patients who are at high risk managed via the telephone help system NHS111 and the PHE health protection teams, but the RCGP RSC surveillance is entirely separate.
The RCGP RSC, by extending its established work, will provide virological and serological surveillance to monitor the temporal and geographical distribution of COVID-19 infection in the community, and assess the effectiveness of the containment strategy.
We would not be working in isolation on this research.
We will share the protocol with UK colleagues and the I-MOVE consortium who have recently obtained EU Horizon 2020 funding from the stream “Advancing knowledge for the clinical and public health response to the novel coronavirus epidemic”.
It is anticipated that great efficiencies in project management will result through this collaboration than that obtained from countries acting alone.
The aim of this study is to identify whether there is undetected community transmission of COVID-19, estimate population susceptibility, and monitor the temporal and geographical distribution of COVID-19 infection in the community.
The objectives of this study are as follows:
To monitor the burden of suspected COVID-19 activity in the community through primary care surveillance and clinical coding of possible COVID-19 cases referred into the containment pathway
To provide virological evidence on the presence and extent of undetected community transmission of COVID-19 and monitor positivity rates among individuals presenting ILI or acute respiratory tract infections to primary care
To estimate baseline susceptibility to COVID-19 in the community and estimate both symptomatic and asymptomatic exposure rates in the population through seroprevalence monitoring
To pilot implementation of a scheme for collection of convalescent sera with antibody profiles among recovered cases of COVID-19 discharged to the community
We intend to capture the following.
Clinical workload related to reports of COVID-19 using the codes created to flag cases, those being assessed and where the infection is located are excluded (Figures 2-​-44)
Foreign countries visited in the last 28 days
Existing codes that may have utility (Tables 1-​-3).3).
Many GPs and primary care teams may not realize that important relevant data can be coded.
There is also the potential during any pandemic to monitor the effectiveness of any transmission control measures.
Reliable coding of letters and test results that will show an infection has become either confirmed or excluded
The methods will follow the approach used in the current influenza surveillance system and recent serology study, and includes five components: (1) primary care clinical surveillance; (2) virological surveillance; (3) population serological surveillance; (4) convalescent sera in cases; and (5) data curation.
The NHS uses the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) system of coding, which is normally only updated twice annually.
There was added complexity as some computerized medical record (CMR) suppliers use the Read coding systems (Read clinical terms version 3 – CTv3), which is no longer updated.
Additionally, there were no clinical codes to record COVID-19 in early February 2020.
Therefore, the two main GP system suppliers added the five terms shown in Table 4 as system-wide local codes.
A UK emergency release of SNOMED CT concepts for COVID-19 was also subsequently made available across all CMR systems (Table 4).
The intention is that these will eventually be mapped to the new SNOMED CT concepts as they become available, allowing recording of relevant data (Multimedia Appendix 1).
The key requirements for this release were the ability to code (Table 4) a case of COVID-19, exposure to risk of infection (travel to an area where there may be a higher risk), contact with anyone infected with COVID-19, a report that a person had been tested for COVID-19, and that the disease had been excluded (likely a negative test).
In addition, practices are now able to code any foreign travel undertaken, including the ability to record visits to multiple countries (implemented February 8, 2020).
Figures 2-​-44 show the EMIS web implementation.
Currently, virology samples for influenza surveillance are accompanied by a standard request form.
For COVID-19, we will create a new request form that will record:
Date of onset of symptoms
Diagnosis of any of the following:
Acute bronchitis/bronchiolitis in those younger than five years
Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI)
History of fever (Y/N); measured (Y/N); if yes, level
Shortness of breath (Y/N), if measured: oxygen saturation and respiratory rate
Recent travel (Y/N); if yes, countries visited in last 14 days
Contact with a named person with confirmed COVID-19 (Y/N) with a free text comment about the level of certainty
These codes will be grouped ontologically into “definite”, “probable”, “possible”, and “not a case” using our standard approach to grouping codes (Table 5), which has been used previously across disease areas.
The RCGP RSC definition for ILI is shown in Multimedia Appendix 2.
Public Presentation of Data Using an Observatory and Dashboards
We will develop an observatory to present data nationally and a dashboard for feedback to practices about their data quality and collection of virology and serology samples.
This is based on coding described in Table 4.
Definite case will be presented on our dashboard as “cases” of COVID-19.
Possible cases will be presented as “Under investigation” (investigating).
“Not a case” will be presented as “Excluded”.
Online data has been established within the initial few weeks in the COVID-19 Observatory (Figure 5), indicating the overall number of patients and rate per 10,000 patients of cases confirmed or under investigation, as well as where the virus is excluded.
We have the option to move to twice weekly surveillance reports with a scope to change this to daily reporting.
We will continue virology sampling from our sentinel practices, rather than discontinuing as seasonal influenza declines.
Additionally, we will recruit more surveillance practices.
The RCGP RSC virology practices will aim to undertake 200-300 nasopharyngeal swabs per week across the RCGP RSC sentinel network, collecting specimens across all age bands.
In addition to the inclusion criteria for influenza virology surveillance (ILI, acute bronchitis/bronchiolitis), participating practices will take nasopharyngeal swab samples from any people showing acute symptoms of LRTI if the onset of symptoms is within 7 days.
RCGP RSC research officers and practice liaison staff will manage practices to achieve a total national sample of 200-300 swabs per week.
This could be increased if PHE modelers require more samples.
Samples from each practice would be spread across the following age groups: &lt; 5 years, 5-17 years, 18-64 years, and 65 years and older
Samples (swabs or serum) collected will be sent via prepaid envelopes addressed to the appropriate PHE laboratory for analysis.
All samples collected will be tested for the presence of influenza and COVID-19.
Additionally, PHE will retrospectively test any influenza virology samples collected between early and mid-February 2020 for COVID-19.
Practices will still follow the PHE protocol for COVID-19 with respect to people at risk of infection who should be signposted down the containment pathway, rather than physically attend their practice.
Direct testing of those who attend surgery remains permitted, but we have also rolled out self-swabbing at home.
Summary of processes are detailed in Multimedia Appendix 3.
Everyone with an ILI or a respiratory illness who contacts a GP (eg, phones for an appointment) should be asked specifically about recent travel to China and other countries flagged in current PHE advice, or if they have had contact with other people with COVID-19.
If these screening enquiries are positive, the patient would be advised to not come to the practice but instead to follow the PHE flow sheet.
This can be by a reception or clinician staff, depending on individual practice protocol.
These calls should be coded into the GP CMR system and can be reported as part of the RCGP RSC weekly return.
We have developed training material to support this coding (Multimedia Appendix 4).
These include prompt cards for:
Practice reception or triage staff: for coding of any patients calling the practice with symptoms of acute respiratory infection with a history of travel to important areas based on PHE advice
Administrative staff or clinicians who code: to encourage consistent coding of results for any suspected cases, including coding of negative results for exclusion
Practices participating in virology surveillance will opportunistically collect blood samples from patients coming into the practice for a routine blood test.
Patients who attend their practice for a routine blood test will be asked to provide an additional sample for serology.
We have conducted initial searches within the RCGP RSC database to look at the number of full blood count (FBC) results and overall rates in adults and children (Figures 6-​-9).9).
An FBC is one of the most common tests performed, and we hope this will give an approximate indication of overall numbers of blood tests performed.
The sampling rate, per 100,000 patients was highest for children 15-17 years of age and 60 year or older in adults, with the lowest rates in children 0-4 years of age and 18-29 years of age in adults (Figures 6-​-99).
We will provide 1000 serology baseline samples across all ages that reflect the varying rates of attendance by age.
Additionally, we will test if we can obtain these all from virology practices to enhance the yield.
A good geographical spread is important, so PHE can advise on areas where serology will most usefully be collected.
This will be followed by 800 samples monthly.
The sample will be stratified with 200 specimens for prepandemic survey (100 for monthly) in the following age groups: &lt; 5 years, 5-17 years, 18-64 years, and 65 years or older.
The younger patients, in many practices younger than 14 years, and in nearly all for children younger than 8 years will require pediatric serology surveillance.
We will develop a new request form for practices to capture recent travel and exposure to COVID-19.
We will pilot a scheme for collecting convalescent serology from people with confirmed cases and who have had an acute virology sample at the time of their infection.
This is to identify a carrier state in patients who have recovered from the virus but may continue shedding the virus.
If there are a small number of cases, this may assist in developing a test kit for patients to take to their own GP and explore its acceptability to patients.
If there are a large number of COVID-19 cases nationally, convalescent samples could be collected from RCGP RSC practices where there are confirmed cases, with the ability to link to the full medical record.
This process may include checking pseudonymized NHS numbers for positive individuals at RCGP RSC practices, checking current PHE guidance regarding considerations of infectiousness for confirmed cases, and offering the patient an appointment following the previously mentioned process.
This needs to be carefully coordinated nationally across the network and may require PHE to ensure individuals are not contacted by multiple agencies.
RCGP RSC could provide a useful structure to channel the initial contact once PHE has made a request.
The RCGP RSC practices participating in the annual influenza virology surveillance have started sampling from patients showing symptoms of a LRTI.
All samples received are being tested for influenza and COVID-19.
The RCGP RSC will explore ways to collect convalescent samples from any patients tested positive for COVID-19 through the extension of the virological surveillance.
From the start, we will be carefully curating data to ensure that it can be used for future studies.
Our clinical data will be linked to virology.
We will curate our data using the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable principles.
To facilitate this our data set is listed with Health Data Research UK and the European Health Data Evidence Network.
The statistical methodology is in support of a policy approach to widespread disease outbreak, where so-called nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are used to respond to an emerging pandemic to produce disease suppression.
This policy aims to reduce contact rates in the population and thereby reduce transmission of the virus.
To implement this the UK government has recently articulated the desire to implement population self-isolation measures.
By targeting the reproduction number (R) (the average number of secondary cases each case generates) and aiming to reduce the R to below 1, the policy seeks to reduce case numbers to low levels or (as seen in previous outbreaks with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Ebola) to eliminate human-to-human transmission.
As the experience from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic has shown, NPIs can be a crucial component of pandemic mitigation.
Key to the focus of our study will be the estimation of peak cases in the population and continual monitoring by data collection and modelling the potential growth and emergence of subsequent peaks in new cases as social distancing measures are relaxed.
There has already been publication of important disease epidemiological measures concerning the outbreak of COVID-19 in mainland China.
A further fundamental measure in pandemic dynamics is the length of time from infection to when a person is infectious to others and the mean duration of infectiousness.
These factors, if estimated accurately, will give good predictions for the likely length of the pandemic, the final number of infected cases.
We intend to apply approximate Bayesian inference (ABC) to (possibly spatially heterogeneous) Susceptible-Exposed- Infectious-Removed (SEIR) stochastic epidemic models.
Such techniques are highly parallelizable and have been successfully applied to many fields including disease transmission modelling.
They are particularly suited to situations where likelihood functions are absent and where more traditional approaches such as Markov chain Monte Carlo are impractical.
Such an approach has been demonstrated to work effectively on the ASPREN surveillance data, a network of sentinel GPs and nurse practitioners who report deidentified information on ILIs and other conditions, where issues such as missing data and the need to model the observation process itself has been successfully addressed.
Furthermore, peaks in new cases have been estimated by distributional methods.
Estimates of the parameters of the SEIR model are tractable on large data sets because of parallelizability, and these methods have been implemented in several R libraries; we intend to use the libraries ABSEIR (deposited on GitHub: https://tinyurl.com/vqu35cj) and abctools (https://tinyurl.com/tfjavz4) to estimate epidemic measures on a weekly basis.
Since we are fitting an SIR-epidemic model in the ABC routine, we anticipate that our results will be robust against weekly case data containing relatively small counts.
For example, see for the ABC methodology applied to the Tristan da Cunha common cold data from 1967, where counts of I (number of infectious cases) and R (number of recovered cases) are in the tens at most.
Finally, in addition to the above methodology we will employ the Kaplan-Meier method with two outcomes (death and recovery) to estimate the case fatality ratio.
This approach is independent of the ABC methodology and will allow comparisons between estimates from the two modelling approaches to judge robustness of results.
RCGP RSC’s surveillance with PHE is defined as Health Protection under Regulation 3 of The Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002.
This has been confirmed by PHE’s Caldicott Guardian’s Office.
We do not see any increased risk to practices or practitioners taking part in this surveillance.
Infection prevention and control advice will follow extant national guidance.
Any cases identified will be managed according to the PHE/NHS guidance in force at the time, including advice for identified contacts.
However, our training will include reminders about safe handling of specimens and revision of infection control measures anticipated to be high in our practices.
It is a key part of Regulation 12 about safe care and treatment, periodically inspected by the Care Quality Commission.
Travel History and Clinical Descriptors of the COVID-19 Infections
The RCGP RSC practices have been advised on the clinical coding that has been made available for COVID-19 across all CMR systems.
This includes information on coding of clinical descriptors (Table 4) and any recent travel history.
Establishment of Extended Virology Sampling
The RCGP RSC practices participating in the annual influenza virology surveillance have started sampling from patients showing symptoms of LRTI.
All samples received are being tested for influenza and COVID-19.
This has led to initial early identification of background spread in low-risk patients.
As of March 7, 2020, the surveillance system has detected 2 cases of COVID-19 in low-risk patients with no history of travel through extended virological sampling.
This protocol describes how we have adapted a national influenza surveillance system to monitor community spread of an unexpected infection of COVID-19.
We have rapidly created and incorporated new codes to allow data recording, and are collecting data to monitor the effectiveness of containment strategies.
Through this surveillance, we intend to find out more about the epidemiology of COVID-19 in ambulatory care.
In particular, its rate of spread, both temporal and geographical.
Our testing of low-risk patients will also inform whether the containment strategy that is based on virology testing of high-risk patients and their contacts plus self-isolation is effective.
Containment should slow the spread, and there may be benefits in the management of spread from intense surveillance.
However, there may come a point at which the virus spreads more widely into the population, as has happened in Italy.
Surveillance of low-risk patients should inform when we reach this tipping point and when infection rates start to remit.
The epidemiology of COVID-19 remains emergent.
The registration-based nature of UK primary care means that we will be able to create a complete picture of the cumulative incidence and duration.
The surveillance system should be able to identify areas where COVID-19 spread is taking place that might be suitable for trials of antiviral therapy.
We could also follow up on the effectiveness or any adverse reactions to these medicines or vaccinations.
Finally, early detection of a confirmed COVID-19 case has exemplified the rapid implementation of this enhanced surveillance in the national network.
Safety of practices is our primary concern.
The RCGP RSC has operated for over 50 years and has been involved in collecting samples to monitor disease and vaccine effectiveness through the Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968/69, the Russian flu of 1977/78, and the 2009 Swine flu pandemic.
We are not aware of any increased risk to practice staff or other patients from involvement in surveillance.
Pandemic preparedness is part of the role of the RCGP RSC.
It is plausible that enhanced coding of information from contacts with the practices in RCGP RSC will reduce the likelihood of people who may be suspected COVID-19 cases being brought to the surgery inadvertently.
Where cases are detected unexpectedly, it is probably helpful for that patient, their contacts, and the practice to know.
The impact on practices has been to close for a day, if a case is found, for deep cleaning and then reopen.
The principal limitations of our system are the number of data points.
We are collecting serology and virology data from 100 sites, which covers a small group of the population.
This has been satisfactory for monitoring influenza, but we are not certain if this is a sufficiently large sample for the COVID-19 outbreak.
Our sites (surveillance practices) are currently fixed, and it could be helpful to be able to rapidly onboard practices in regions where there are more cases.
Currently, we will be reporting weekly.
Our existing system can be enhanced to twice weekly, but maybe daily or hourly data should be our current approach.
Opportunistic sampling for serology in children younger than 10 years might be limited due to the overall reduced rate of blood tests in children.
The extended surveillance using the RCGP RSC-PHE network for the emergent COVID-19 outbreak has been established rapidly.
The model of getting the appropriate informatics to enable capture of the required data has already been a success, with data recording starting the week the codes were created.
In addition, modifying the existing surveillance system to collect population data in a parallel way has also been effective.
However, we are at present unsure as to whether the scale of this surveillance provides sufficient data to drive local containment strategies or if reporting infrequently meets the need of our information age.
Updating the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 “suspected case” and “confirmed case” is necessary
On 6 February 2020, our team had published a rapid advice guideline for diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guideline provided our experience and make well reference for fighting against this pandemic worldwide.
However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; hence, the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also continually updated.
In this letter, we answered one comment on our guideline and provided the newest diagnostic criteria of “suspected case” and “confirmed case” according to the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) that issued by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused an outbreak, which is now officially named as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a rapid advice guideline and that has been published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has attracted a great attention since published.
Note however that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the ongoing research findings and clinical practice experience; hence, the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also continually updated.
For instance the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), among 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, has issued a total of seven editions with some contexts being substantively changed.
Now our guideline received a comment by Zhou et al., they introduced a simple scoring proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work added new evidence for our guideline and also make valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We endorse their significant work and express our thanks.
However, their work also needs update according to the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Trial seventh version) and recently studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case needs to combine any one item of epidemiological history features with two items of clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or needs to meet three items of clinical manifestations if without clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases had been reported in the last 14 days before symptom onset; (2) a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contacting with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 had been reported in the last 14 days before symptom onset; (4) a history of contacting with cluster of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurred within 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office, class of school, etc).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/ or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts showing normal, decreased, or reduced lymphocyte count in the early onset stage.
Diagnosing the confirmed case should base on suspected case with any one item of pathogenic or serological evidence as following: (1) real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) viral whole genome sequencing showing high homogeneity to the known novel coronaviruses; (3) positive for the specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in serum test; or a change of the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody from negative to positive, or titer rising ≥4 times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The pathogenic detection of blood sample was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications based on the researchers continued work that to search for an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as the samples from respiratory tract including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens, and supported bringing the specific antibody positive result into the confirmed criteria.
Besides, there are more and more evidence that remind us to caution with the atypical symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Hence, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as “low risk”.
The score system also needs to be verified in further clinical practice and studies.
To conclude, we hope more direct evidence coming up and call for readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of “suspected case” and “confirmed case”, we suggest to trace and obey the newest guidelines of their home countries.
Our team will also timely update our guideline to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, a daily highest
Yesterday, Bangladesh has confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on the day.
This is the highest number of fatalities in a day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported the number of recorded infected cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who were staying home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news briefing, the director of IEDCR, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the fatalities included four males and one female.
According to Dr Meerjady, two cases were aged above 60, two between 51 and 60, and one 41-50 years old.
She also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director of Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was cared for at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladeshi Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said public transport would be shut down for longer than initially planned, until this coming Saturday.
This public transport shutdown had initially started on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of essential goods -- medical, fuel and food -- was still allowed.
The first recorded incidents of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were on March 8, in two people who returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, these three had already recovered.
National Basketball Association suspends season due to COVID-19 concerns
On Wednesday, the United States' National Basketball Association (NBA) suspended its professional basketball season due to concerns regarding COVID-19.
The NBA's decision followed a Utah Jazz player testing positive for the COVID-19 virus.
The NBA did not release the identity of the player in question in its announcement.
They did say he was not present at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City, where the Utah Jazz were to play against the Oklahoma City Thunder.
According to its press release, the NBA was "suspending game play following the conclusion of [Wednesday's] schedule of games until further notice."
The Jazz's game was cancelled, as was another NBA game Wednesday between the Sacramento Kings and the New Orleans Pelicans.
Other games scheduled for Wednesday were still held, according to NBC News.
The United States' other major basketball organization, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which runs college basketball, has cancelled its own tournament, March Madness, for both men's and women's leagues.
According to Johns Hopkins University, as of Wednesday, there were at least 1,279 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States.
CNBC reported there were at least 118,381 cases worldwide.
SARS-CoV-2 surpasses one million infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections surpassed one million worldwide, Johns Hopkins University data indicated.
At least 52 thousand deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone came the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claimed, as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries remaining free of coronavirus infections.
By yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty four hours preceding 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, over 244 thousand coronavirus cases were recorded, linking to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing Johns Hopkins University data, there were over 1,000 US deaths on Wednesday caused by coronavirus infections.
Around the world, countries announced stricter measures to inhibit the disease from spreading.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city lockdown to May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin declared Russians would continue to be paid without going to work until April 30.
The parliament of Portugal voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days; the vote passed with 215 votes in favor, ten abstentions, and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to last the entire day; previously, the curfew was only in effect between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced the state had extended its stay-at-home order until May 1.
Stores in Australia lower toilet paper limits per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their purchase restrictions on toilet paper to two and one package per transaction in all stores on national level, respectively.
ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit, on Monday.
These limitations were posted as messages on the checkouts, and on the chains' Facebook pages.
Buyers were reportedly stocking up due to fears of COVID-19 in case people need to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited toilet paper purchases for home delivery to one pack per order.
These changes followed the previous four-pack per transaction restriction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively.
Coles, in its March 8 media release, reported that with the four-pack restriction in place, "many stores are still selling out within an hour of delivery", and called the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unexpected".
Sales went up in a "sharp increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the allowed amount to two packs last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered bigger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI made stocks for a planned Wednesday special available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers try to raise stock, but local council restrictions on the timing of truck-deliveries make it hard.
He expects rising production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer specials.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that following the early release of stock, some stores can't run the Wednesday special.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said the stores fill the stock every night.
He remarked toilet paper is a bulky item, leading to low quantity of stocks in numbers, and, when sold out, leaves vast shelf spaces empty, hardening the feeling of a shortage.
Coles and Woolworths have a view [that] if there was plenty of stuff on the shelf, if product like toilet rolls and sanitiser could be [bought] and are there in quantities, you would probably minimise the panic said Russell Zimmerman per ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper producer Who Gives a Crap said on last Wednesday they'd run out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper which makes Sorbent, emphasized they were working 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to the News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported some property sellers offering free toilet paper to the first bidder on auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held because of buyers having time off on the long weekend of Labour Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included an eight-page insert meant to be cut up and used as toilet paper.
The stores were originally reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report from ABC Australia on March 3 in which they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on the purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitiser, dried goods, handwash and flour.
Similarly, outside of Australia, on Sunday evening online British supermarket Ocado was observed limiting purchases of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packs.
US President Trump declares COVID-19 national emergency
On Friday, United States President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.
The move came two days after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak, which causes the COVID-19 disease, to be a pandemic.
The move gives the federal government access to around US$50 billion in extra funding to combat the pandemic, according to NBC News.
The proclamation specifically said "the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States constitutes a national emergency" and said the national emergency began on March 1, almost two weeks before the proclamation itself.
The United States Department of Health and Human Services declared the outbreak a "public health emergency" on January 31.
Trump did not place the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in charge of the government's response to COVID-19, which Politico reported left some experts in disaster management disappointed.
Politico quoted Tim Manning, formerly a deputy administrator at FEMA, as saying "FEMA has an important role in coordinating the larger response to the crisis" and "[i]f there's an emergency, FEMA needs to be involved."
Trump made the decision under provisions of the National Emergencies Act, amongst other governing authorities.
The Trump administration also announced other efforts in response to COVID-19, including waiving the interest it collects on federal student loans and increasing U.S. strategic oil reserve oil purchases.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — to be a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" only refers to how widely a disease has spread, not how dangerous specific cases are, the WHO noted the need to drive governments to action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, trace and mobilize their people in the response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of the WHO.
We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, formerly the director of the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
He said, in remarks published by CNN in February, "other than influenza, no other respiratory virus has been tracked from emergence to continuous global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never before seen a pandemic sparked by a coronavirus."
He continued, "and we have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new status as a pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease's director, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, "bottom line, it's going to get worse."
As of Thursday, Associated Press reported there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in over 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The case fatality rate has been estimated to be 4% in China, while globally ranging from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.
Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls, and facility closures.
The pandemic has led to severe global socioeconomic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities have closed either on a nationwide or local basis in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and others from areas with significant virus cases.
Due to reduced travel and closures of heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
The cases mostly had links to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and so the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV.
The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.
Of the early cluster of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case traced back to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old from Hubei province, may have been the first.
On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that, as new cases reportedly declined in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases within China for the first time.
There may be substantial underreporting of cases, particularly among those with milder symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among youths, with those 19 and under making up 2.4% of cases worldwide.
The United Kingdom's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to become infected before effective herd immunity could be achieved.
Cases refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies not to test those with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, up to 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these undocumented infections were the infection source for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published 30 March estimated that numbers of infections in Italy were considerably greater than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention has concluded that it may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time from development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February about 80% of deaths were in those over 60, and 75% had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.Official tallies of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to dead people who tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The number of true fatalities from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who die without testing - e.g. at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death tally by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged "We know that [the stated death toll] is an underestimation", a statement corroborated by anecdotal reports of undercounting in the U.S. Such underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths each were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health.
The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates for the death-to-case ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptom onset 1–10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptom onset after 1 February 2020).
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percent of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percent of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not timebound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution.
A number of academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the infection fatality rate for the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is consistent with the results from the first random testing for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
The WHO asserts that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and ultimate duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University stated, "Left unchecked, infectious outbreaks typically plateau and then start to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts.
But it's almost impossible to make any sensible projection right now about when that will be".
The Chinese government's senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that "it could be over by June" if all countries can be mobilized to follow the WHO's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "is going to be circulating, potentially for a year or two".
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine becomes available (potentially 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus—because it's so readily transmissible—will disappear completely" and it "might turn into a seasonal disease, making a comeback every year".
The virulence of the comeback would depend on herd immunity and the extent of mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum production (phlegm), loss of the sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis.
The WHO states that approximately one person in six becomes seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.Further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of those infected may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm infection, so researchers have issued advice that those with close contact to confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range from few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset) ranges from one to 14 days; it is most commonly five days.
As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and later fell to 15%.
Some details about how the disease is spread are still being determined.
The disease is believed to be primarily spread during close contact and by small droplets produced during coughing, sneezing, or talking; with close contact being within 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that an uncovered coughing can lead to droplets travelling up to 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus may also be transmitted by small droplets that stay for more prolonged periods in the air, that may be generated during speech.
Respiratory droplets may also be produced during breathing out, including when talking, though the virus is not generally airborne.
The droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be aerosolized and thus result in airborne spread.
It may also spread when one touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there are concerns it may spread by faeces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Government of China denied the possibility of faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
The virus is most contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
People have tested positive for the disease up to three days before onset of symptoms suggesting transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
Only few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.
The virus survives for hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for one day on cardboard, and for up to four hours on copper.
This, however, varies based on the humidity and temperature.
Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence animals can pass the virus on to humans, though British authorities advise washing one's hands after contact with animals, like after contact with other surfaces infected people could have touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope.
SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains.
It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between the viruses from pangolins and those from humans.
Whole-genome comparison to date has found at most 92% of genetic material shared between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host.
Infection by the virus can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, though confirmation is ultimately by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, with many of its imaging features overlapping with other pneumonias and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used to screen for or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with the first issued on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
Generally this test is carried out on a nasopharyngeal swab though a throat swab may also be used.
A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these has been proved sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
In the US a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic imaging features on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacities and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks have been developed to detect imaging features of the virus with both radiographs and CT.
Strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue and putting the tissue directly into a waste container.
Those who may already have the infection have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.
Many governments have restricted or advised against all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some community members don't know where or how they were infected.
Health care providers taking care of someone who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, contact precautions, and eye protection.
Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, over a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
Users then receive a message if they've been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.
Misconceptions are circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwash are not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, though many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after blowing one's nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.
CDC further recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available.
The WHO advises people to avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces may be decontaminated with a number of solutions (within one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62–71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by the ill persons, should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommended that people cover their mouth and nose with a bent elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing, and disposing of any tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce the propensity [of] people to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene."Masks have also been recommended for use by those taking care of someone who may have the disease.
The WHO has recommended the wearing of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for a person with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their face.
Several countries have started to encourage the use of face masks by members of the public.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face mask made out of cloth.China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, particularly when coming into close contact (1 metre (3 ft) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health officials are encouraging people to make cloth facemasks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned going out in public without wearing a mask or covering one's nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested everyone to wear a face mask when going to public areas in order to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government mandated that everyone entering a grocery store must wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks when in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks per day since mid-March, required passengers on trains and intercity buses to wear face masks on 1 April.
Panama has made it obligatory to wear a face mask whenever going outside, while also recommending the manufacture of a homemade face mask for those who cannot purchase face masks.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres.
Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum gathering size recommended by US government bodies and health organizations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.
Older adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune systems face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak.
In late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either virtually or at a distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" had led to implications that people should engage in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means.
Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
These include recommendations to only have sex with someone you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.
Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high risk groups.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.
Strategies in the control of an outbreak are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.
A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1.
Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.
More drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.
Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.
Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic causes social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral medications approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing medications.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking fluids, and resting may help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and breathing support may be required.
The use of steroids may worsen outcomes.
Several compounds that were previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in treating COVID-19.
The WHO also stated that some "traditional and home remedies" can provide relief of the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity and adapting healthcare for the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.
The ECDC and the European regional office of the WHO have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services for shifting of resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, cancelling elective procedures whenever possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about where the very first case (the so-called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus may trace back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these kinds of animals; or, in other words, has a zoonotic origin.
A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues of a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were admonished by the police for spreading false rumours, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later released a public notice on 31 December and informed the WHO.
Enough cases of unknown pneumonia had been reported to health authorities in Wuhan to trigger an investigation in early January.
During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange.
On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data shows that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January 2020.
As of 26 March, the United States has overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.
As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
Around 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted free movement and set up border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures such as quarantines (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or lockdown) and curfews.
As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are under some form of lockdown in the United States, more than 50 million people are in lockdown in the Philippines, about 59 million people are in lockdown in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people are in lockdown in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later—around a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 has been traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report suggests the earliest case was on 17 November.
Doctor Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on 26 December, upon which her hospital informed Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
Initial genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was released by Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
As these notifications occurred, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police for "spreading rumours" about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign later described by the Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to contain the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the largest quarantine in human history", a cordon sanitaire was announced on 23 January stopping travel in and out of Wuhan, which was extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
Private vehicle use was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year (25 January) celebrations were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was built afterwards, Leishenshan Hospital, to handle additional patients.
In addition to newly constructed hospitals, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals.
On 26 January, the government instituted further measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for travellers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools around the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau instituted several measures, particularly in regard to schools and universities.
Remote working measures were instituted in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were enacted in and outside of Hubei.
Public transport was modified, and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
Control of public movement was applied in many cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of outdoor restriction.
After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from "importing" from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city.
On 23 March, mainland China only one case had transmitted domestically in the five days prior, in this instance via a traveller returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestically transmitted cases has been basically blocked and the outbreak has been controlled in China.
The same day travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed.
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March onwards, with no specific details on when this policy will end.
Those who wish to enter China will have to apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to re-open on 30 March, and provided monetary stimulus packages for firms.
The State Council declared a day of mourning to begin with a national three-minute moment of silence on 10:00 4 April, coinciding with Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay their respects online in observance of physical distancing as to avoid a renewed COVID-19 outbreak.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
The nation's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on 20 February, largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji devotees visiting Daegu from Wuhan were suspected to be the origin of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, among 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 or about 13% reported symptoms.
South Korea declared the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
Airline schedules were also affected and therefore they were changed.
South Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best-organized programme in the world to screen the population for the virus, and isolate any infected people as well as tracing and quarantining those who contacted them.
Screening methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile application, drive-thru testing for the virus with the results available the next day, and increasing testing capability to allow up to 20,000 people to be tested every day.
South Korea's programme is considered to be a success in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantining entire cities.
The South Korean society was initially polarized on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions either calling for the impeachment of Moon over what they claimed to be government mishandling of the outbreak, or praising his response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest one-day case total in four weeks.
On 29 March it was reported that beginning 1 April all new overseas arrivals will be quarantined for two weeks.
Per media reports on 1 April, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries.
Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections on 19 February in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and Friday prayers, and closures of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran allocated five trillion rials to combat the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that there were no plans to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic between cities ahead of the Persian New Year Nowruz continued.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020.
Iran became a centre of the spread of the virus after China during February.
Amidst claims of a cover-up of the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries had traced their cases back to Iran by 28 February, indicating that the extent of the outbreak may be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was shut down, with 23 of its 290 members reported to have had tested positive for the virus on 3 March.
On 12 March, the Human Rights Watch urged the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release the human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and to also temporarily release all the eligible prisoners.
It stated that there is a greater risk of the virus to spread in closed institutions like detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the most recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
At least 12 sitting or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from the disease by 17 March.
By 23 March, Iran was experiencing 50 new cases every hour and one new death every ten minutes due to coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, there may be five times more cases in Iran than what is being reported.
It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran may be affecting the country's financial ability to respond to the viral outbreak.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded economic sanctions to be eased for nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise sharply, which prompted the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
An unassociated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February.
On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, including quarantining more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the outbreak areas, entry and exit will not be provided.
Suspension of work activities and sports events has already been ordered in those areas."On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the full closure of all schools and universities nationwide as Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March, all sport was suspended completely for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered stoppage of nearly all commercial activity except supermarkets and pharmacies.On 6 March, the Italian College of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding triage protocols that might be employed.
On 19 March, Italy overtook China as the country with the most coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 fatalities from the pandemic.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military planes with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, with the majority of those cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and inability to test all who have the virus to date may be contributing to the high fatality rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus first emerged as one of the most relaxed of the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British government did not impose any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for the perceived lack of pace and intensity in its response to concerns faced by the public.
On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement advising against all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting people work from home where possible and avoid venues such as pubs, restaurants, and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure establishments such as pubs and gyms were to close as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages to a limit of £2,500 per month to prevent unemployment in the crisis.
On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced tougher social distancing measures, banning gatherings of more than two people and restricting travel and outdoor activity to that deemed strictly necessary.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were enforceable by police through the issuing of fines and the dispersal of gatherings.
Most businesses were ordered to close, with exceptions for businesses deemed "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware shops, petrol stations, and garages.

On 28 January 2020, the Center for Disease Control—the leading public health institute of the U.S. government—announced they had developed their own testing kit.
Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start in testing, which obscured the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
Testing was marred by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, a lack of federal government approval for non-government test kits (by academia, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people to qualify for a test until early March (a doctor's order was required thereafter).
By 27 February, The Washington Post reported fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
By 13 March, The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests had been conducted.
On 22 March, the Associated Press reported: "Many people who have symptoms and a doctor's order have waited hours or days for a test."After the first death in the United States was reported in Washington state on 29 February, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, an action that was soon followed by other states.

Overall approval of Trump's management of the crisis has been polarized along partisan lines.
Some U.S. officials and commentators criticized the U.S. reliance on importation of critical materials, including essential medical supplies, from China.
An analysis of air travel patterns was used to map and predict patterns of spread and was published in The Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.
Based on 2018 information from the International Air Transport Association, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Taipei had the largest volume of travellers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney, and Melbourne were also reported as popular destinations for people travelling from Wuhan.
Bali was reported as least able among the 20 most popular destination cities in terms of preparedness, while cities in Australia were considered most able.

On the other hand, Chinese aid has been well-received in parts of Latin America and Africa.
On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The WHO has commended the efforts of Chinese authorities in managing and containing the epidemic.
The WHO noted the contrast between the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that impeded prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government "has provided regular updates to avoid panic ahead of Lunar New Year holidays".
On 23 January, in reaction to the central authorities' decision to implement a transportation ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea remarked that while it was "certainly not a recommendation the WHO has made", it was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated" and called it "unprecedented in public health history".
On 30 January, following confirmation of human-to-human transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that the PHEIC was due to "the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementations of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that the "WHO doesn't recommend limiting trade and movement."
On 5 February, the WHO appealed to the global community for a $675 million contribution to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency to support those countries which "do not have the systems in place to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it were to emerge".
Tedros further made statements declaring that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more later".
On 11 February, the WHO in a press conference established COVID-19 as the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to provide the "power of the entire UN system in the response".
A UN Crisis Management Team was activated as a result, allowing coordination of the entire United Nations response, which the WHO states will allow them to "focus on the health response while the other agencies can bring their expertise to bear on the wider social, economic and developmental implications of the outbreak".
On 14 February, a WHO-led Joint Mission Team with China was activated to provide international and WHO experts on the ground in China to assist in the domestic management and evaluate "the severity and the transmissibility of the disease" by hosting workshops and meetings with key national-level institutions and to conduct field visits to assess the "impact of response activities at provincial and county levels, including urban and rural settings".
On 25 February, the WHO declared that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic," stating that while it was still too early to call it a pandemic, countries should nonetheless be "in a phase of preparedness".
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, the WHO sent a Joint Mission Team there to assess the situation.
On 28 February, WHO officials said that the coronavirus threat assessment at the global level would be raised from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies program, warned in a statement that "This is a reality check for every government on the planet:
Wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready,"
Urging that the right response measures could help the world avoid "the worst of it".
Ryan further stated that the current data did not warrant public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration would mean "we're essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to that virus."
On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General said that the WHO was "deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction".
The WHO has faced significant criticism for what is seen as inadequate handling of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The backlash included a petition for the WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to tender his resignation, signed by 733,000 people as of 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized respecting the rights of every individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone is entitled to life-saving interventions and the government holds this responsibility.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should never serve as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts underscored that every individual has the right to health, including people with disabilities, belonging to minority groups, older people, internally displaced people, the homeless, those living in extremely poor conditions, people in detention, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as viewpoints and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the world economy to addressing the effects of lockdown and restrictions on travel, the digital hub includes a Country Policy Tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and to facilitate a co-ordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, UK Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove, and Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro for its handling of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed over their handling of the quarantine efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from the public's anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian rejected an earlier acknowledgement of the coronavirus outbreak starting in Wuhan, in favour of conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 originating from the U.S. or Italy.
The U.S. administration of Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" saying that China's "censorship supercharged a virus that has now turned into a global pandemic", which has in turn been criticized by some critics as racism and "distract[ing] from his administration's failure to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast obtained a U.S. government cable outlining a communications stratagem with apparent origins in the National Security Council, with the strategy being quoted as "Everything is about China.
We're being told to try and get this messaging out in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances.
"Outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to virus-stricken countries is part of a propaganda push for global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there is "a geo-political component including a struggle for influence through spinning and the'politics of generosity'".
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the US, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China has also called for the US to lift its sanctions off of Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while reportedly sending aid to the latter two countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by US sanctions on 3 April.
US authorities have also been accused of diverting aid meant for other nations to their own country.
And there have been mask-related disputes reported between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of ventilators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union's lack of solidarity with coronavirus-affected Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said that "Only China responded bilaterally.
Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian president Vladimir Putin arranged the Russian army to send military medics, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
Italy's La Stampa newspaper cited an anonymous "high-level political source" that 80 percent of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitical and diplomatic" charm offensive.
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio dismissed the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "when offering assistance to US colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when US manufacturers of medical equipment and materials gain momentum, they will also be able to reciprocate if necessary."
The planned NATO "Defender 2020" military exercise in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a reduced scale.
The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament's general secretary Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public-health crisis, it jeopardizes the lives not only of the troops from the US and the many European countries participating but the inhabitants of the countries in which they are operating."The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with around two dozen parliament members infected as well as fifteen other current or former political figures.
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying that his country is struggling to fight the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States sanctions against Iran.
The outbreak has prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and higher levels of funding for public health.
Political analysts anticipated it may negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election.
Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced anybody coming from South Korea will be placed in two weeks' quarantine at government-designated sites.
The South Korean society was initially polarized on President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions either calling for the impeachment of Moon over what they claimed to be government mishandling of the outbreak, or praising his response.
The pandemic has allowed countries to pass emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concerns that it could allow governments to strengthen their grip on power.
In Hungary, its parliament voted to allow the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several instances of supply shortages, stemming from globally increased usage of equipment to fight the outbreaks, panic buying, and disruption to factory and logistic operations.
The United States Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of drugs and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supplier disruption.
Several localities also witnessed panic buying that led to shelves being cleared of grocery essentials such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water, inducing supply shortages.
The technology industry in particular has been warning about delays to shipments of electronic goods.
According to WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protection equipment has risen 100-fold.
This demand has led to the increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also induced delays on the supply of medical items for four to six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the WHO warning that this will endanger health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for daigou shoppers to sell Australian products into China.
The activity has created a shortage of baby formula in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government.
Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the ensuing high demand for food products, both areas have been spared from acute food shortages.
Measures by China and Italy against the hoarding and illicit trade of critical products have been successful, avoiding acute food shortages that were anticipated in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy with its significant agricultural production has not seen a large reduction, but prices may increase according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were only encountered temporarily, even in Wuhan city, while Chinese government officials released pork reserves to assure sufficient nourishment of the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy requiring food producers to keep reserves for such emergencies.
Damage to the global economy has been felt in China: according to a media report on 16 March, the economy in China was very hard hit in the first two months of 2020 due to the measures taken by the government to curtail virus spread, and retail sales plunged 20.5%.
As mainland China is a major economy and manufacturing hub, the viral outbreak has been seen to pose a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.

Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised central banks' and states' timely emergency measures.
Central banks are reacting more quickly than they did to the 2008 financial crash.
Tourism is one of the worst affected sectors due to travel bans, closing of public places including travel attractions, and advice of governments against any travel all over the world.
As a consequence, numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise line industry was at a level never seen before.
Several train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, a major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
A number of events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including annual New Year festivals, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year's holiday to 10 February, instructing most workplaces not to re-open until that date.
These regions represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year celebrations.
The retail sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in store hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40%.
North America and Middle East retailers saw a 50–60% drop.
This also resulted in a 33–43% drop in foot traffic to shopping centres in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world imposed additional measures, such increased sanitation, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events.
According to a United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimate, the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers have been stranded at home in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province.
In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government aid.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rate may hit 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
The lockdown in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid through daily wages) unemployed.
The survey from the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some type of unemployment.
Nearly 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since it went into lockdown in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme.
Almost half a million companies in Germany have sent their workers on a government-subsidized short-time working schemes known as Kurzarbeit.
The German short-time work compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been profoundly affected by the pandemic, impacting organizations' operations as well as individuals—both employed and independent—globally.
Arts and culture sector organizations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists where possible.
By March 2020, across the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms.
Another recent and rapidly accelerating fallout of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major events in sports, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced disruption.
The Vatican announced that Holy Week observances in Rome, which occur during the last week of the Christian penitential season of Lent, have been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended older Christians to stay at home rather than attending Mass on Sundays; some churches have made church services available via radio, online live streaming or television while others are offering drive-in worship.
With the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square emptied of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were later closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its residents to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.

The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event will be "rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021".
Casinos and other gaming venues worldwide have closed and live poker tournaments have been either postponed or cancelled.
This has led many gamblers to move online, with many online gambling sites reporting significant increases in their rates of new sign-ups.
The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or cancelling concert tours.
Many large theatres such as those on Broadway also suspended all performances.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share work over the internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live streaming concerts or creating web-based "festivals" for artists to perform, distribute, and publicize their work.
Online, numerous coronavirus-themed Internet memes have spread as many turn to humour and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, heightened prejudice, xenophobia, and racism have been noted toward people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and against people from hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when the majority of the cases had still been confined to China) have documented racist sentiments expressed in various groups worldwide of Chinese people deserving the virus or receiving what has been claimed as justified retribution.
Some countries in Africa have also seen a rise in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
There has been support for the Chinese, both on and offline, and towards those in virus-stricken areas.
Following the progression of the outbreak to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subjected to suspicion and xenophobia.
Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed petitions lobbying to ban Chinese people from entering their countries in an effort to stop the disease.

Laboratory testing for the respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus' RNA.
This test is specific and is designed to only detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Detection of antibodies (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too minor to report or who were asymptomatic.
An accurate mortality rate of the disease and the level of herd immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020 no countries had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in their population.
By 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of their population, and there are massive variations in how much testing has been done across countries.
This variability is also likely to be significantly affecting reported case fatality rates, which are likely to be significantly over-estimated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) the test can be done on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swab or sputum sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with throat swabs is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later on the virus can disappear in the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, alternatively sample material can then be taken from the deep airways by suction catheter or coughing up material (sputum) can be used.
One of the early PCR tests was developed at Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis of 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed a test by 23 January 2020.
The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It looks for the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.
In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from China's National Medical Products Administration for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.
In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to public health labs through the International Reagent Resource.
One of three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits caused inconclusive results due to faulty reagents, and a bottleneck of testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of fewer than 100 samples a day being successfully processed throughout the whole of February 2020.
Tests using two components were not determined to be reliable until 28 February 2020, and it was not until then that state and local laboratories were permitted to begin testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization.
US commercial labs began testing in early March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020 LabCorp announced nationwide availability of COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics similarly made nationwide COVID-19 testing available as of 9 March 2020.
No quantity limitations were announced; specimen collection and processing must be performed according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020 the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare.
On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to have developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection.
On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test which could be performed within 3.5 hours in high volume, thus allowing one machine to do approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid similarly received EUA from the FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles this method can deliver positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to ramp up manufacturing to deliver 50,000 tests per day.
A test which uses a monoclonal antibody which specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes just like a rapid influenza test.
A March 2020 literature review concluded that "chest radiographs are of little diagnostic value in early stages, whereas CT [computed tomography] findings may be present even before symptom onset."
Typical features on CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacificities with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving and consolidation develop as the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, though less specific, with many of its imaging features overlapping with other pneumonias and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used to screen for or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals starting 7 days or so after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and in population surveillance.
Assays can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by point-of-care testing (PoCT).
The high-throughput automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these assays but their availability will depend on the rate of production for each system.
For CLT a single specimen of peripheral blood is commonly used, although serial specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT a single specimen of blood is usually obtained by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods an extraction step is not needed before assay.
On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as required and are now therefore able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only a single test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization.
In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples within hours and therefore much faster than the conventional PCR assay of viral RNA.
The antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the onset of the infection.
In early April, the UK found none of the antibody test kits it purchased were sufficiently good to use.
Hong Kong has set up a scheme where suspected patients can stay home, "emergency department will give a specimen tube to the patient", they spit into it, send it back and get a test result a while after.
The British NHS has announced that it is piloting a scheme to test suspected cases at home, which removes the risk of a patient infecting others if they come to a hospital or having to disinfect an ambulance if one is used.
In drive-through testing for COVID-19 for suspected cases, a healthcare professional takes sample using appropriate precautions.
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea do some of the fastest, most-extensive testing of any country.
In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on 2 March, that it had a capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in the ambulatory setting and 10.700 had been tested in the prior week.
Costs are borne by the health insurance when the test is ordered by a physician.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity for 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March drive in tests were offered in several large cities.
As of 26 March 2020 the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, because only positive results are reported.
A first lab survey revealed that as of calendar week 12/2020 a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested up to and including week 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by pooling the samples and only testing further if the combined sample is found to be positive.
In Wuhan a makeshift 2000-sq-meter emergency detection laboratory named "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: 火眼, or "Fire Eye" in English) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which can process over 10,000 samples a day.
With the construction overseen by BGI-founder Wang Jian and taking 5-days, modelling has show cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost of the tackling the quarantine would have doubled if this testing capacity hadn't come on line.
The Wuhan Laboratory has been promptly followed by Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
By 4 March 2020 the daily throughput totals were 50,000 tests per day.
Open source, multiplexed designs released by Origami Assays have been released that can test as many as 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 assays.
These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic liquid handlers.
By March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagent has become a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU and UK and the US.
This has led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing.
On 31 March it was announced United Arab Emirates was now testing more of its population for Coronavirus per head than any other country, and was on track to scale up the level of testing to reach the bulk of the population.
This was through a combination of drive-through capability, and purchasing a population-scale mass-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Constructed in 14 days, the lab is capable of conducting tens of thousands RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world of this scale to be operational outside of China.
Different testing recipes targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German recipe for manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop their own.
The German recipe was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, delaying available tests in the U.S.
China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to satisfy demand and recommendations for testing by health experts.
In contrast, experts say South Korea's broad availability of testing helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Testing capacity, largely in private sector labs, was built up over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for ramping up the testing programmes as the best way to slow the advance of COVID-19 pandemic.
High demand for testing due to wide spread of the virus caused backlogs of hundreds of thousands of tests at private U.S. labs, and supplies of swabs and chemical reagents became strained.
In March 2020 China reported problems with accuracy in their test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "flaws;" the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing.
Spain purchased test kits from Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that results were inaccurate.
The firm explained that the incorrect results may be a result of a failure to collect samples or use the kits correctly.
The Spanish ministry said it will withdraw the kits that returned incorrect results, and would replace them with a different testing kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.
80% of test kits the Czech Republic purchased from China gave wrong results.
Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China which were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested these be dumped into the Danube.
Ateş Kara of the Turkish Health Ministry said the test kits Turkey purchased from China had a "high error rate" and did not "put them into use."
The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 announced these were not usable.
Testing, followed with quarantine of those who tested positive and tracing of those with whom the SARS-CoV-2 positive people had had contact, resulted in positive outcomes.
Researchers working in the Italian town of Vò, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing on the entire population of about 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
About half the people testing positive had no symptoms, and all discovered cases were quarantined.
With travel to the commune restricted, this eliminated new infections completely.
With aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has proceeded much more slowly than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions like forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore did start advising residents to stay at home on 28 March, but schools reopened on time after holiday break on 23 March.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic with aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, but with less aggressive lock-downs, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has found that countries that have tested more, relative to the number of deaths, have much lower case fatality rates, probably because these countries are better able to detect those with only mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID-19 send their first five positives and the first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Out of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the column “Positive as% of tests” is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that only tests people admitted to hospitals will have a higher positive as% of tests than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they are showing symptoms, other things being equal.
Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands for the purpose of removing soil, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Hand washing with soap consistently at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted through fecal–oral route.
People can also become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day where washing hands with soap is important include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child's bottom or changing nappies, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash.The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing the diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet.
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animal, animal feed, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medicine or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of washing hands is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals which can cause harm or diseases.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; decreasing respiratory infections;
And reducing infant mortality rate at home birth deliveries.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand washing practices may lead to small improvements in the length growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, childhood mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the rate of mortality from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhoea episodes by about a third, and this is comparable to providing clean water in low income areas.
48% of reductions in diarrhoea episodes can be associated with hand washing with soap.
Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), as automatic behavior performed in homes, schools, and communities worldwide.
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the number one cause of mortality among children under five years old, taking the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for almost 3.5 million child deaths annually.
According to UNICEF, turning hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet into an ingrained habit can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, cutting deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by one-quarter.
Hand washing is usually integrated together with other sanitation interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small detrimental effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to an itchy, flaky skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health-care workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times during the day where washing hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of disease: after using the bathroom (urination, defecation), after cleaning a child's bottom (changing nappies), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other occasions when correct handwashing technique should be practiced in order to prevent the transmission of disease include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of hand washing with soap.
A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average, 38.7% of households practiced hand washing with soap.
A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; the United States near the middle with 77 percent; and China with the lowest rate of 23 percent.
Several behaviour change methodologies now exist to increase uptake of the behaviour of hand washing with soap at the critical times.
Group hand washing for school children at set times of the day is one option in developing countries to engrain hand washing in children's behaviors.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of at scale action to promote children's health and education.
Deworming twice a year, supplemented with washing hands daily with soap, brushing teeth daily with fluoride, is at the core of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removal of microorganisms from skin is enhanced by the addition of soaps or detergents to water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soil, are not readily dissolved in water.
Cleansing is, however, aided by a reasonable flow of water..
Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, may hold bacteria acquired from previous uses.
A small number of studies which have looked at the bacterial transfer from contaminated solid soap have concluded transfer is unlikely as the bacteria are rinsed off with the foam.
The CDC still states "liquid soap with hands-free controls for dispensing is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted to a health-conscious public.
To date, there is no evidence that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants selects for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
So, even if antibiotic resistant strains aren't selected for by antibacterial soaps, they might not be as effective as they are marketed to be.
Besides the surfactant and skin-protecting agent, the sophisticated formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulator, antimicrobially active benzoic acid and further skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).
A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that plain soaps are as effective as consumer-grade anti-bacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing illness and removing bacteria from the hands.
Hot water that is comfortable for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water at removing natural oils which hold soils and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief however, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent.
In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, alcohol rub non-water-based hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated together with a thickening agent such as Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) into a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin into a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to decrease the drying effect of the alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen-peroxide increases further the antimicrobial activity.
Hand sanitizers containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol are efficient germ killers.
Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 log reduction, similar to 35 decibel reduction) of the bacteria on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of the bacteria on hands 1 minute after application.
Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis.
Enough hand antiseptic or alcohol rub must be used to thoroughly wet or cover both hands.
The front and back of both hands and between and the ends of all fingers are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
Finger tips must be washed well too, rubbing them in both palms.
The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing over hand sanitizer rubs, particularly when hands are visibly dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid killing activity against micro-organisms; however, they should not serve as a replacement for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused substantially less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol hand rubs rarely occur.
The lower tendency to induce irritant contact dermatitis became an attraction as compared to soap and water hand washing.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not cleanse the hands of organic material, but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water at preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the pathogens still remain on the hands.
Alcohol-free hand sanitizer efficacy is heavily dependent on the ingredients and formulation, and historically has significantly under-performed alcohol and alcohol rubs.
More recently, formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to decrease in efficacy after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms it may increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfecting agent because in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommended ash or sand as alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Correct handwashing technique recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control for prevention of transmission of disease includes the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because standing basins may be contaminated, while the temperature of the water does not seem to make a difference.
Lather hands by rubbing them with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of hands, between fingers, and under nails.
Soap lifts germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when soap is used rather than water alone.
Scrub for at least 20 seconds.
Scrubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from skin, and scrubbing for longer periods removes more germs.
Rinse well under running water.
Rinsing in a basin can recontaminate hands.
Dry with a clean towel or allow to air dry.
Wet and moist hands are more easily recontaminated.
The most commonly missed areas are the thumb, the wrist, the areas between the fingers, and under fingernails.
Artificial nails and chipped nail polish may harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep the hands from drying out; dry skin can lead to skin damage which can increase the risk for the transmission of infection.
Various low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing where tap-water and/or soap is not available e.g. pouring water from a hanging jerrycan or gourd with suitable holes and/or using ash if needed in developing countries.
In situations with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-conserving solutions, such as "tippy-taps" and other low-cost options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology using a jug suspended by a rope, and a foot-operated lever to pour a small amount of water over the hands and a bar of soap.
Effective drying of the hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate over the most effective form of drying in public washrooms.
A growing volume of research suggests paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many washrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper-towel industry the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, warm-air hand dryers and the more modern jet-air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the warm-air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase on average on the finger pads by 194% and on the palms by 254%.
Drying with the jet-air dryer resulted in an increase on average of the total number of bacteria on the finger pads by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced on average on the finger pads by up to 76% and on the palms by up to 77%.
The scientists also carried out tests to establish whether there was the potential for cross contamination of other washroom users and the washroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet-air dryer, which blows air out of the unit at claimed speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was capable of blowing micro-organisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminating other washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 metres away.
Use of a warm-air hand dryer spread micro-organisms up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of micro-organisms.
In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
The following changes in the bacterial count after drying the hands were observed:
Many different hand dryer manufacturers exist, and hand driers have been compared against drying with paper towels.
Hand washing using hand sanitizing wipes is an alternative during traveling in the absence of soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand-washing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study has found decreased infection rates with their use.
Medical hand-washing is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to lather and rub each part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed together with digits interlocking.
If there is debris under fingernails, a bristle brush may be used to remove it.
Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to turn off the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This avoids re-contaminating the hands from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand-washing in the health-care setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid transmitting them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that a lack of hand-washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with large numbers of doctors and nurses routinely forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand-washing and other simple procedures can decrease the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent.
The World Health Organization has published a sheet demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-rubbing in health-care sectors.
The draft guidance of hand hygiene by the organization can also be found at its website for public comment.
A relevant review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene, if demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Moments" for washing hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
Before an aseptic task, and
After patient care.
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap ("medicated" or "antimicrobial" soaps) confers killing action to a hand-washing agent.
Such killing action may be desired prior to performing surgery or in settings in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly prevalent. To'scrub' one's hands for a surgical operation, it is necessary to have a tap that can be turned on and off without touching it with the hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, sterile towels for drying the hands after washing, and a sterile brush for scrubbing and another sterile instrument for cleaning under the fingernails.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.
Long scrub-times (10 minutes) are not necessary.
When rinsing, water on the forearms must be prevented from running back to the hands.
After hand-washing is completed, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is donned.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash the hands or use a hand antiseptic before and after tending to a sick person.
For control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from hand-cleansing came from the first 20% of washing, and that very little additional benefit was gained when hand cleansing frequency was increased beyond 35%.
Washing with plain soap results in more than triple the rate of bacterial infectious disease transmitted to food as compared to washing with antibacterial soap.
Comparing hand-rubbing with alcohol-based solution with hand washing with antibacterial soap for a median time of 30 seconds each showed that the alcohol hand-rubbing reduced bacterial contamination 26% more than the antibacterial soap.
But soap and water is more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs for reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores from hands.
Interventions to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings can involve education for staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand rub, and written and verbal reminders to staff.
There is a need for more research into which of these interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective, essential tool for achieving good health, and even good nutrition.
However, a lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, at schools and at the workplace make it a challenge to achieve universal hand washing behaviors.
For example, in most of rural Africa hand washing taps close to every private or public toilet are scarce, even though cheap options exist to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates rather can also be the result of engrained habits rather than due to a lack of soap or water.
The promotion and advocacy of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term behavior change of the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective at increasing hand washing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective.One example for hand washing promotion in schools is the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygienic requirements.
When minimum standards are achieved, schools can move from one to ultimately three stars.
Building hand washing stations can be a part of hand washing promotion campaigns that are carried out in order to reduce diseases and child mortality.
Global Hand washing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that is trying to achieve behavior change.
As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the adoption of a handwashing emoji.
Few studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relationship to DALYs averted.
However, one review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health – particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances like mothers who had just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals – was first recognized in the mid 19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At that time most people still believed that infections were caused by foul odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and healthcare-associated infections led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to increased awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect oneself from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "correct hand washing techniques" were hung up next to hand washing sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing one's hands of" something, means declaring one's unwillingness to take responsibility for the thing or share complicity in it.
It originates from the bible passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a phrase with a much wider usage in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse an imagined stain, representing her guilty conscience regarding crimes she had committed and induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, after having recalled or contemplated unethical acts, tend to wash hands more often than others, and tend to value hand washing equipment more.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such a contemplation are less likely to engage in other "cleansing" compensatory actions, such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes.
Symbolic hand washing, using water but no soap to wash hands, is a part of ritual hand washing featured in many religions, including Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam.
Religions also prescribe hygienic hand washing, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam mandate washing of hands after using the toilet.
And, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam mandate washing of hands before and after every meal.
Impact of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic on education
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic has affected educational systems worldwide, leading to the widespread closures of schools and universities.
As of 8 April 2020, approximately 1.716 billion learners have been affected due to school closures in response to COVID-19.
According to UNESCO monitoring, 188 countries have implemented nationwide closures and 5 have implemented local closures, impacting about 99.4% of the world's student population.
On 23 March 2020, Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) released a statement announcing the cancellation of Cambridge IGCSE, Cambridge O Level, Cambridge International AS &amp; A Level, Cambridge AICE Diploma, and Cambridge Pre-U examinations for the May/June 2020 series across all countries.
International Baccalaureate exams have also been cancelled.
School closures impact not only students, teachers, and families, but have far-reaching economic and societal consequences.
School closures in response to COVID-19 have shed light on various social and economic issues, including student debt, digital learning, food insecurity, and homelessness, as well as access to childcare, health care, housing, internet, and disability services.
The impact was more severe for disadvantaged children and their families, causing interrupted learning, compromised nutrition, childcare problems, and consequent economic cost to families who could not work.
In response to school closures, UNESCO recommended the use of distance learning programmes and open educational applications and platforms that schools and teachers can use to reach learners remotely and limit the disruption of education.
Efforts to stem the spread of COVID-19 through non-pharmaceutical interventions and preventive measures such as social-distancing and self-isolation have prompted the widespread closure of primary, secondary, and tertiary schooling in over 100 countries.
Previous outbreaks of infectious diseases have prompted widespread school closings around the world, with varying levels of effectiveness.
Mathematical modelling has shown that transmission of an outbreak may be delayed by closing schools.
However, effectiveness depends on the contacts children maintain outside of school.
School closures may be effective when enacted promptly.
If school closures occur late relative to an outbreak, they are less effective and may not have any impact at all.
Additionally, in some cases, the reopening of schools after a period of closure has resulted in increased infection rates.
As closures tend to occur concurrently with other interventions such as public gathering bans, it can be difficult to measure the specific impact of school closures.
During the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic in the United States, school closures and public gathering bans were associated with lower total mortality rates.
Cities that implemented such interventions earlier had greater delays in reaching peak mortality rates.
Schools closed for a median duration of 4 weeks according to a study of 43 US cities' response to the Spanish Flu.
School closures were shown to reduce morbidity from the Asian flu by 90% during the 1957–58 outbreak, and up to 50% in controlling influenza in the US, 2004–2008.
Multiple countries successfully slowed the spread of infection through school closures during the 2009 H1N1 Flu pandemic.
School closures in the city of Oita, Japan, were found to have successfully decreased the number of infected students at the peak of infection; however closing schools was not found to have significantly decreased the total number of infected students.
Mandatory school closures and other social distancing measures were associated with a 29% to 37% reduction in influenza transmission rates.
Early school closures in the United States delayed the peak of the 2009 H1N1 Flu pandemic.
Despite the overall success of closing schools, a study of school closures in Michigan found that "district level reactive school closures were ineffective."
During the swine flu outbreak in 2009 in the UK, in an article titled "Closure of schools during an influenza pandemic" published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases, a group of epidemiologists endorsed the closure of schools in order to interrupt the course of the infection, slow further spread and buy time to research and produce a vaccine.
Having studied previous influenza pandemics including the 1918 flu pandemic, the influenza pandemic of 1957 and the 1968 flu pandemic, they reported on the economic and workforce effect school closure would have, particularly with a large percentage of doctors and nurses being women, of whom half had children under the age of 16.
They also looked at the dynamics of the spread of influenza in France during French school holidays and noted that cases of flu dropped when schools closed and re-emerged when they re-opened.
They noted that when teachers in Israel went on strike during the flu season of 1999–2000, visits to doctors and the number of respiratory infections dropped by more than a fifth and more than two fifths respectively.
For schools and childcare facilities, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person has been in a school building regardless of community spread.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as cancelling field trips, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or meals in a cafeteria, increasing the space between desks, staggering arrival and dismissal times, limiting nonessential visitors, and using a separate health office location for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is substantial transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school dismissals may be considered.
On 26 January, China instituted measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak which included extending the Spring Festival holiday to contain the outbreak.
Universities and schools around the country closed.
On 23 February, Iran's Ministry of Health announced the closure of universities, higher educational institutions and schools in several cities and provinces.
On 3 March, UNESCO released the first global numbers on school closures and affected students.
It reported that 13 countries had enacted preventive measures including the temporary closure of schools and universities, impacting 290.5 million students around the world.
In reaction, UNESCO called on countries to support affected students and families and facilitate large-scale inclusive distance learning programmes.
On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the full closure of all schools and universities nationwide as Italy reached 100 deaths.
In doing so, Italy became one of 22 countries on three continents which had announced or implemented school closures.
On 5 March, the majority of learners affected by COVID-19 emergency measures were located in China, with 233 million learners affected, followed by Japan at 16.5 million and Iran at 14.5 million.
By 10 March, one in five students worldwide was "staying away from school due to the COVID-19 crisis" while another one in four was barred from higher education institutions.
On 13 March, governments in 49 countries announced or implemented school closures, including 39 countries which closed schools nationwide and 22 countries with localised school closures.
By 16 March, this figure increased from 49 to 73 countries according to UNESCO.
By 19 March, 50% of students worldwide were affected by school closures, corresponding to nationwide closures in 102 countries and local closures in 11 countries affecting 850 million children and youth.
By 20 March, over 70% of the world's learners were impacted by closures, with 124 country-wide school closures.
On 23 March, all Nigerian school were found to have been closed down by Nigerian government, markets as well as companies were closed down and children were forbidden by parents to step out of their homes.
On 26 March, all New Zealand schools and universities have been closed down across the country.
The government has imposed a two-week holiday, allowing schools to transition to forms of distant teaching as soon as possible.
Universities have closed for one week, but resumed with online teaching afterwards.
Other school services remain open, but teaching is restricted to distant learning.
By 27 March, nearly 90 percent of the world's student population was out of class.
Regions with schools remaining open included Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, Sweden, and some U.S. states.
By 29 March, more than 1.5 billion children and other students were affected by nationwide school closures.
Others were disrupted by localized closures.
Until April 6, holidays were extended in all secondary schools of Turkmenistan.
An order signed by the Ministry of Education as a preventative measure aims to prevent the spread of respiratory diseases in connection with the WHO coronavirus pandemic.
10 countries have localised schools closures, UNESCO estimates 473,933,356 learners are potentially at risk (pre-primary to upper-secondary education) and 77,938,904 learners are potentially at risk in tertiary education.
Note: Figures correspond to total number of learners enrolled at pre-primary, primary, lower-secondary, and upper-secondary levels of education [ISCED levels 0 to 3], as well as at tertiary education levels [ISCED levels 5 to 8] who could be affected should localised closures become countrywide.
Enrolment figures based on latest UNESCO Institute of Statistics data.
School closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have shed a light on numerous issues affecting access to education, as well as broader socio-economic issues.
As of March 12, more than 370 million children and youth are not attending school because of temporary or indefinite country wide school closures mandated by governments in an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19.
As of 29 March, nearly 90% of the world's learners were impacted by closures.
Even when school closures are temporary, it carries high social and economic costs.
The disruptions they cause affect people across communities, but their impact is more severe for disadvantaged children and their families including interrupted learning, compromised nutrition, childcare problems and consequent economic cost to families who cannot work.
Working parents are more likely to miss work when schools close in order to take care of their children, incurring wage loss in many instances and negatively impacting productivity.
Localised school closures place burdens on schools as parents and officials redirect children to schools that are open.
Women often represent a large share of health-care workers and often cannot attend work because of childcare obligations that result from school closures.
This means that many medical professionals are not at the facilities where they are most needed during a health crisis.
Lack of access to technology or fast, reliable internet access can prevent students in rural areas and from disadvantaged families.
Lack of access to technology or good internet connectivity is an obstacle to continued learning, especially for students from disadvantaged families.
In response to school closures caused by COVID-19, UNESCO recommends the use of distance learning programmes and open educational applications and platforms that schools and teachers can use to reach learners remotely and limit the disruption of education.
To aid in slowing the transmission of COVID-19, hundreds of libraries have temporarily closed.
In the United States, numerous major cities announced public library closures, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and New York City, affecting 221 libraries.
For students without internet at home, this increases the difficulty of keeping up with distance learning.
School closures puts a strain on parents and guardians to provide childcare and manage distance learning while children are out of school.
In the absence of alternative options, working parents often leave children alone when schools close and this can lead to risky behaviours, including increased influence of peer pressure and substance abuse.
Many children worldwide rely on free or discounted meals at schools.
When schools close, nutrition is compromised.
Nutrition plays a critical role in cognitive development and academic performance for children.
In Washington State, around 45% of the states 1.1 million students enrolled in traditional public and charter schools qualify for subsidised school meals.
At least 520,000 students and their families may be affected by food insecurity as a result of school closures.
School lunch programmes are the second-biggest anti-hunger initiative in the United States after food stamps.
Every year, nearly 30 million children rely on schools to provide free or low-cost meals including breakfast, lunch, snacks, and even dinner.
In Alabama, where state-wide school closures as of 18 March have affected over 720,000 students, the state Superintendent announced that staff in schools disproportionately affected by poverty would create meal distribution networks to provide food for students who rely on school lunches.
School closures negatively impact student learning outcomes.
Schooling provides essential learning and when schools close, children and youth are deprived opportunities for growth and development.
The disadvantages are disproportionate for under-privileged learners who tend to have fewer educational opportunities beyond school.
Student drop-out rates tend to increase as an effect of school closures due to the challenge of ensuring all students return to school once school closures ends.
This is especially true of protracted closures.
Schools are hubs of social activity and human interaction.
When schools are closed, many children and youth miss out of on social contact that is essential to learning and development.
When schools close parents are often asked to facilitate the learning of children at home and can struggle to perform this task.
This is especially true for parents with limited education and resources.
Potential impacts of school closures and reliance on distance learning are not addressed in federal acts of legislation at this time.
Formal education — as opposed to informal education or non-formal education — tends to refer to schools, colleges, universities and training institutions.
A 1974 report by the World Bank defined formal education as the following:Formal education: the hierarchically structured, chronologically graded ‘education system’, running from primary school through the university and including, in addition to general academic studies, a variety of specialised programmes and institutions for full-time technical and professional training.
The majority of data collected on the number of students and learners impacted by COVID-19 has been calculated based on the closure of formal education systems.
The UNESCO Institute for Statistics provides figures on students impacted by COVID-19 corresponding to the number of learners enrolled at pre-primary, primary, lower-secondary, and upper-secondary levels of education [ISCED levels 0 to 3], as well as at tertiary education levels [ISCED levels 5 to 8].
Early childhood educational programmes are usually designed for children below the age of 3 and may refer to preschools, nursery schools, kindergartens, and some day care programmes.
While many primary and secondary schools have closed around the world due to COVID-19, measures impacting early childhood educational programmes have varied.
In some countries and territories, preschools and day cares are considered necessary services and have not closed in tandem with broader school closure measures.
In the United States, the Washington State Department of Children, Youth, and Families encouraged child care and early learning centres to stay open.
Some school districts may offer alternative child care options, prioritising the children of first responders and healthcare workers.
The governor of Maryland mandated that specific child care services remain open for the children of emergency personnel while Washington State and California have left it to the discretion of care providers.
California Governor Gavin Newsom explained his state's position, saying “We need our child care facilities, our daycare centers, to operate to absorb the impact of these school closures.”
Colorado has encouraged the development of "tool kits" for parents to use at home to emulate the lessons children would have received in their early learning programmes.
In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe closed all schools throughout the country until April 8, however, children's daycare facilities were excluded.
In early March, five adults associated with a nursing facility for preschool children in Kobe tested positive for coronavirus.
After testing over one hundred children at the facility, a preschool student was found to be carrying the virus.
Primary or elementary education typically consists of the first four to seven years of formal education.
The International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) canceled the examinations for its Diploma Programme and Career-related Programme candidates scheduled between 30 April and 22 May 2020, reportedly affecting more than 200,000 students worldwide.
The IBO stated that it would award candidates their diplomas or certificates based on "their coursework" and "the established assessment expertise, rigor, and quality control already built into the programme."
Tertiary education, also known as higher education, refers to the non-compulsory educational levels that follow completion of secondary school or high school.
Tertiary education is normally taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, as well as vocational education and training.
Individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive certificates, diplomas, or academic degrees.
Undergraduate education is education conducted after secondary education and prior to post-graduate education, for which the learner is typically awarded a bachelor's degree.
Students enrolled in higher education programmes at colleges, universities, and community colleges are often refereed to in countries such as United States as "college students."
The closure of colleges and universities has widespread implications for students, faculty, administrators, and the institutions themselves.
Colleges and universities across the United States have been called upon to issue refunds to students for the cost of tuition and room and board.
In the United States of America, Colleges and universities operate as "mini-cities" which generate significant revenue for cities, states, and regions.
For example, Princeton University contributed $1.58 billion USD to the New Jersey economy and students spent about $60 million in off-campus spending.
College and university closures have a domino effect on economies with far-reaching implications.
According to Linda Bilmes of the Harvard Kennedy School, "local hotels, restaurants, cafes, shops, car rental agencies and other local businesses obtain a significant share of annual revenue from graduation week and college reunions...
These communities will suffer a lot of economic damage if the colleges remain closed at that time."Small towns which rely on college students to support the local economy and provide labour to local businesses are especially impacted by school closures and the exodus of students from campus.
In Ithaca, New York, Cornell University students spent at least $4 million a week in Tompkins county.
In the wake of Cornell's decision to keep students home following spring break and transition to virtual instruction, the Mayor of Ithaca called for "immediate and forceful federal action — we will see a horrific economic impact as a result of Cornell University closing."
UNESCO is sharing 10 recommendations during this period:
Examine the readiness and choose the most relevant tools: Decide on the use high-technology and low-technology solutions based on the reliability of local power supplies, internet connectivity, and digital skills of teachers and students.
This could range through integrated digital learning platforms, video lessons, MOOCs, to broadcasting through radios and TVs.
Ensure inclusion of the distance learning programmes: Implement measures to ensure that students including those with disabilities or from low-income backgrounds have access to distance learning programmes, if only a limited number of them have access to digital devices.
Consider temporarily decentralising such devices from computer labs to families and support them with internet connectivity.
Protect data privacy and data security: Assess data security when uploading data or educational resources to web spaces, as well as when sharing them with other organisations or individuals.
Ensure that the use of applications and platforms does not violate students’ data privacy.
Prioritize solutions to address psychosocial challenges before teaching: Mobilize available tools to connect schools, parents, teachers, and students with each other.
Create communities to ensure regular human interactions, enable social caring measures, and address possible psychosocial challenges that students may face when they are isolated.
Plan the study schedule of the distance learning programmes: Organise discussions with stakeholders to examine the possible duration of school closures and decide whether the distance learning programme should focus on teaching new knowledge or enhance students’ knowledge of prior lessons.
Plan the schedule depending on the situation of the affected zones, level of studies, needs of students needs, and availability of parents.
Choose the appropriate learning methodologies based on the status of school closures and home-based quarantines.
Avoid learning methodologies that require face-to-face communication.
Provide support to teachers and parents on the use of digital tools: Organise brief training or orientation sessions for teachers and parents as well, if monitoring and facilitation are needed.
Help teachers to prepare the basic settings such as solutions to the use of internet data if they are required to provide live streaming of lessons.
Blend appropriate approaches and limit the number of applications and platforms: Blend tools or media that are available for most students, both for synchronous communication and lessons, and for asynchronous learning.
Avoid overloading students and parents by asking them to download and test too many applications or platforms.
Develop distance learning rules and monitor students’ learning process: Define the rules with parents and students on distance learning.
Design formative questions, tests, or exercises to monitor closely students’ learning process.
Try to use tools to support submission of students’ feedback and avoid overloading parents by requesting them to scan and send students’ feedback
Define the duration of distance learning units based on students’ self-regulation skills: Keep a coherent timing according to the level of the students’ self-regulation and metacognitive abilities especially for livestreaming classes.
Preferably, the unit for primary school students should not be more than 20 minutes, and no longer than 40 minutes for secondary school students.
Create communities and enhance connection: Create communities of teachers, parents, and school managers to address sense of loneliness or helplessness, facilitate sharing of experience and discussion on coping strategies when facing learning difficulties.
290 million students out of school due to COVID-19: UNESCO releases first global numbers and mobilizes response, UNESCO.
Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19
Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational safety and health methodologies for hazard controls to the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper hazard controls in the workplace depend on the worksite and job task, based on a risk assessment of sources of exposure, disease severity in the community, and risk factors of individual workers who may be vulnerable to contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), lower exposure risk jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory etiquette, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfecting of the work environment.
Medium exposure risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected with COVID-19, but may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, high-population-density work environments, and some high-volume retail settings.
Hazard controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneeze guards, and having personal protective equipment available in case a person with COVID-19 is encountered.
OSHA considers healthcare and mortuary workers exposed to known or suspected person with COVID-19 to be at high exposure risk, which increases to very high exposure risk if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures on, or collect or handle specimens from, known or suspected person with COVID-19.
Hazard controls appropriate for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate to the job task.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several effects within the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to becoming sick, needing to care for others, or from fear of possible exposure.
Patterns of commerce may change, both in terms of what goods are demanded, and the means of acquiring these goods (such as shopping at off-peak hours or through delivery or drive-through services).
Lastly, shipments of items from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted.
An infectious disease preparedness and response plan can be used to guide protective actions.
Plans address the levels of risk associated with various worksites and job tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and risk factors of individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline controls necessary to address those risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
Objectives for response to an outbreak include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people who are at higher risk for adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The disease severity in the community where the business is located affects the responses taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to group hazard controls by effectiveness.
Where COVID-19 hazards cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and lastly personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in work policy or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected based upon the hazard to the worker, properly fitted as applicable (e.g., respirators), consistently and properly worn, regularly inspected, maintained, and replaced, as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned, and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), lower exposure risk jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory etiquette including covering coughs and sneezes, providing tissues and trash receptacles, preparing for telecommuting or staggered shifts if needed, discouraging workers from using others' tools and equipment, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfecting of the work environment.
Prompt identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a critical step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at a worksite.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness are to stay home until they are free of fever, signs of a fever, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medicines, and that sick leave policies are flexible, permit employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, medium exposure risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of people who are not known or suspected COVID-19 patients, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the business location, or because the individual has recent international travel to a location with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, high-population-density work environments, and some high-volume retail settings.
Engineering controls for this and higher risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as clear plastic sneeze guards, and installing a drive-through window for customer service.
Administrative controls for this and higher risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, establishing staggered shifts, discontinuing nonessential travel to locations with ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks, developing emergency communications plans including a forum for answering workers’ concerns, providing workers with up-to-date education and training on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behaviors, training workers who need to use protecting clothing and equipment how to use it, providing resources and a work environment that promotes personal hygiene, requiring regular hand washing, limiting customers' and the public's access to the worksite, and posting signage about hand washing and other COVID-19 protective measures.
Depending on the work task, workers with at least medium exposure risk may need to wear personal protective equipment including some combination of gloves, a gown, a face shield or face mask, or goggles.
Workers in this risk group rarely require use of respirators.
If a person becomes sick on an airplane, proper controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others by a distance of 6 feet, designating one crew member to serve the sick person, and offering a face mask to the sick person or asking the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when tending to a sick traveler or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick traveler has fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.
For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, hazard controls include postponing travel when sick, and self-isolating and informing the onboard medical center immediately if one develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should occur in the isolated person's cabin.
For schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person has been in a school building regardless of community spread.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as canceling field trips, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or meals in a cafeteria, increasing the space between desks, staggering arrival and dismissal times, limiting nonessential visitors, and using a separate health office location for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is substantial transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school dismissals may be considered.
For law enforcement personnel performing daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by CDC.
Law enforcement officials who must make contact with individuals confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including proper personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during apprehension, workers should clean and disinfect their duty belt and gear prior to reuse using a household cleaning spray or wipe, and follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE and for containing and laundering clothes.
OSHA considers certain healthcare and mortuary workers to be at high or very high categories of exposure risk.
High exposure risk jobs include healthcare delivery, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These become very high exposure risk if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures on, or collect or handle specimens from, known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol-generating procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopies, some dental procedures and exams, or invasive specimen collection.
High exposure risk mortuary jobs include workers involved in preparing the bodies of people who had known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of their death; these become very high exposure risk if they perform an autopsy.
Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with known or suspected COVID-19, including when aerosol-generating procedures are performed.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare and mortuary settings.
Specimens should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be separated into distinct waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspected COVID-19 case.
In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for those who work within 6 feet of patients known to be, or suspected of being, infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those performing aerosol-generating procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators or better must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes fit-testing, training, and medical exams.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort.
The WHO does not recommend coveralls, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through bodily fluids.
WHO recommends only a surgical mask for point-of-entry screening personnel.
For those who are collecting respiratory specimens from, caring for, or transporting COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-generating procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles, or face shield, gown, and gloves.
If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE necessary for the specific task, continuing use of the same respirator without removing it while caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.
WHEREAS on March 4, 2020, I proclaimed a State of Emergency to exist in California as a result of the threat of COVID-19;
And WHEREAS in a short period of time, COVID-19 has rapidly spread throughout California, necessitating updated and more stringent guidance from federal, state, and local public health officials;
And WHEREAS for the preservation of public health and safety throughout the entire State of California, I find it necessary for all Californians to heed the State public health directives from the Department of Public Health.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GAVIN NEWSOM, Governor of the State of California, in accordance with the authority vested in me by the State Constitution and statutes of the State of California, and in particular, Government Code sections 8567, 8627, and 8665 do hereby issue the following Order to become effective immediately:
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:
1) To preserve the public health and safety, and to ensure the healthcare delivery system is capable of serving all, and prioritizing those at the highest risk and vulnerability, all residents are directed to immediately heed the current State public health directives, which I ordered the Department of Public Health to develop for the current statewide status of COVID-19.
Those directives are consistent with the March 19, 2020, Memorandum on Identification of Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers During COVID-19 Response, found at: https://covid19.ca.gov/.
ORDER OF THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER
To protect public health, I as State Public Health Officer and Director of the California Department of Public Health order all individuals living in the State of California to stay home or at their place of residence except as needed to maintain continuity of operations of the federal critical infrastructure sectors, as outlined at https://www.cisa.gov/critical-infrastructure-sectors.
In addition, and in consultation with the Director of the Governor's Office of Emergency Services, I may designate additional sectors as critical in order to protect the health and well-being of all Californians.
Pursuant to the authority under the Health and Safety Code 120125, 120140, 131080, 120130(c), 120135, 120145, 120175 and 120150, this order is to go into effect immediately and shall stay in effect until further notice.
The federal government has identified 16 critical infrastructure sectors whose assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, are considered so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, economic security, public health or safety, or any combination thereof.
I order that Californians working in these 16 critical infrastructure sectors may continue their work because of the importance of these sectors to Californians' health and well-being.
This Order is being issued to protect the public health of Californians.
The California Department of Public Health looks to establish consistency across the state in order to ensure that we mitigate the impact of COVID-19.
Our goal is simple, we want to bend the curve, and disrupt the spread of the virus.
The supply chain must continue, and Californians must have access to such necessities as food, prescriptions, and health care.
When people need to leave their homes or places of residence, whether to obtain or perform the functions above, or to otherwise facilitate authorized necessary activities, they should at all times practice social distancing.
2) The healthcare delivery system shall prioritize services to serving those who are the sickest and shall prioritize resources, including personal protective equipment, for the providers providing direct care to them.
3) The Office of Emergency Services is directed to take necessary steps to ensure compliance with this Order.
4) This Order shall be enforceable pursuant to California law, including, but not limited to, Government Code section 8665.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that as soon as hereafter possible, this Order be filed in the Office of the Secretary of State and that widespread publicity and notice be given of this Order.
This Order is not intended to, and does not, create any rights or benefits, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, against the State of California, its agencies, departments, entities, officers, employees, or any other person.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Great Seal of the State of California to be affixed this 19th day of March 2020.

SEND DATE/TIME: 14 March, 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENSING: CC0: No rights reserved
We find ourselves in remarkable circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear our global human interconnectedness and the responsibilities we have to one another.
We don’t have precedent for its challenges, but we do know that our best response relies on the sort of global empathy, cooperation, and community building that sits at the heart of this organization.
The camaraderie and care we have seen among all of our colleagues over email, calls, and chats is a remarkable validation of the incredible humans we are fortunate enough to work with.
I couldn’t be more grateful and proud to count you all as colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They reminded me how meaningful it is for the world to be able to turn to Wikipedia right now, and what a powerful symbol it is for this critical resource to remain online and available to all.
Your work makes this possible, whether you keep the sites stay up or our colleagues paid or our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, now more than ever.
This is a moment in which not only what we do, but how we do it, will make a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will be making some significant adjustments to how we work together, starting this coming week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned previously, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we’re facing and the best way to keep the organization sustainable during this time.
Overwhelmingly we wanted to remove stress and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to dial back, that’s okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily working expectations will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We’re not declaring a holiday - if you are able to work more normal hours, the mission can use you.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and whether you need to care for loved ones, get groceries, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We are not tracking your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
This should go without saying, but we’re saying it.
No sick days or PTO required - just tell your manager and help your team revise calendars and schedules to make sure key areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive for COVID-19, please let Bryan within T&amp;C Ops know so T&amp;C can help with support and make sure your situation gets appropriate attention from management).
Hourly folks will be fully paid.
We have already said, and are recommitting to honor our commitments to our contractors and hourly staff colleagues.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their usual hours worked during normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way of channeling their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially during times like this.
Again, this is about your self-care.
Our ask is that you communicate with your manager, so we know what to expect and can adjust accordingly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are some things that we must keep doing.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp; Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) do critical work that may need additional support.
We’ll begin a process with all departments to assess current objectives and shift our focus to supporting what’s essential for our mission.
There’s plenty to do for all of us, we just will all focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing now won’t hurt later.
We do not plan to go “double-time to catch up” once the pandemic has passed.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines which are now unrealistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and will work to set new targets and timelines where appropriate.
What happens with the APP (Annual Planning)?
To adjust to our new reality and daily working hour expectations, we intend to adjust the timeline for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that allows more time for budgeting to allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care, and care for loved ones while accommodating those who need or wish to work a reduced schedule over the next few weeks.
This timeline extension greatly reduces current planning workloads and pressure across the whole organization.
We will introduce our proposal to the Board next week and will update delegates and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Office status, exposure, and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of an abundance of caution, we employed an antiviral cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They utilized a hospital-grade anti-viral solution to disinfect every surface, as well as the lobby and elevator banks accessing our floor.
The building is employing its own duty-of-care protocol utilizing products that support the safety of their tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office will be well-prepared for when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC-based staff members.
As of last week, our DC office moved to a fully remote setup in line with the guidance shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, we have also been in discussion about leasing a location in Brooklyn.
These discussions are continuing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-time remote colleagues know that it can be an adjustment, and wanted to offer you some advice:
Limit the length of meetings to at most one or two hour increments.
If longer sessions are required, consider how they can be broken up over the course of several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have an agenda, and send reading materials in advance.
Make video the default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and connection.
Have a lead to facilitate every meeting, someone to monitor the chat for questions and track the speaker list, and someone to help take notes (or do collaborative note-taking).
Send an email to tech support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your wellness reimbursement for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk with your colleagues about distributed work
The HR Operations team is looking into webinar-based ergonomics guidance to support the increase in distributed work across the Foundation.
This past week we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as editathons, until the WHO declares the pandemic to be over.
We let them know that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible to complete their agreed-upon grant activities and that no one would be penalized for having to delay or modify those goals.
This coming week we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general sentiment from around the global community seems to be both sadness at the disruption but relief at the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and otherwise.
Going forward, the CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Staying in touch around COVID-19 related issues
We’ll be sending an invitation to your calendars for next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We’ll use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
We’re in this together and here to help however we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information from this email, and all other essential COVID-19 related information, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will keep these pages updated and all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff who reside in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workstream, or coverage challenge, or anything else you may need help with, please don’t hesitate to notify and work with the CRT.
We’re here to help provide support and liaise as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please email Bryan Judan - Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as an abandonment of our work and obligations.
Rather, they are a recognition that at this moment, our work and obligations will likely need to adapt in a way we have not in the past.
These are the steps we believe are necessary to support this one another so that we can continue to work, provide our movement with the support they need, and the world with the service they rely on.
Our planned work will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support one another and create space for the important work that will be coming in the weeks and potentially months ahead.
We need all of you to make that happen, and so we need you all to take care of yourself and your families so that you can be at your best when the need arises.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don’t touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the cause of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), a contagious respiratory disease that was first identified in December 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
The disease is a type of coronavirus, the same family that includes SARS, MERS, and some varieties of the common cold.
It was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020.
While much about COVID-19 is still unknown, preliminary data suggests that it is more virulent and contagious than the seasonal flu, and less virulent but more contagious than SARS and MERS.
Older people and those with underlying conditions are the most at risk of serious complications including death.
Due to the spread of the disease, you are advised not to travel unless necessary, to avoid being infected, quarantined, or stranded by changing restrictions and cancelled flights.
Avoid crowded places whenever possible.
This is not just to protect you, but also those you come in contact with.
As it happens, you probably aren't missing much by staying home, as many attractions around the world are closing their doors to avoid spreading the disease.
If you do need to travel, take precautions as you would for other infections: wash your hands frequently, avoid touching your face, cough and sneeze into your elbow or a tissue, and avoid contact with sick people.
Before traveling, read up on the extensive and fast-changing array of travel restrictions that have been imposed around the world.
After travel, monitor your health and consider self-isolation for two weeks to avoid transmitting the disease to others.
Transportation from long-distance passenger flights to local buses has been curtailed or completely shut down in many countries due to low demand or government orders.
Many international and regional borders are closed.
If you are away from home, and especially if you are in another country, consider returning home as soon as possible; this may get even more difficult as restrictions continue to change.
In some cases it may simply not be possible, even if you're healthy and meet the legal requirements for entry.
If you can't find a way back to your country, contact your nearest embassy or consulate for assistance.
They may be able to organize an evacuation, identify non-regularly scheduled flights, or give you an emergency loan to pay for transport.
In case they can't, make preparations in case you need to stay where you are for an extended period.
If you do find a way back home, be prepared that it may be expensive, inconvenient, and have unusual restrictions (such as no checked baggage).
As of early April 2020, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is approaching one million.
Though the disease started in mainland China, it has spread around the world and China has fewer confirmed cases and deaths than several other countries.
Europe is the new epicenter of the pandemic.
All but a handful of countries have reported at least one case, with the highest numbers of reported cases in the United States, Spain, Italy, Germany, France, mainland China, Iran, and the United Kingdom.
Local transmission is established in many countries in all major inhabited regions of the world except some Pacific island nations.
(See updates from the WHO.)
The full extent of the spread is uncertain, due in part to limited testing.
Many countries are experiencing a severe shortage of test kits, and the authorities have not been able to test everybody who is at high risk, so the real number of cases is probably much higher than the official one.
Countries also differ in their testing and reporting practices, so comparisons of the number of reported cases do not tell the full story of how the epidemic has progressed in different areas.
The virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets and through objects.
The coronavirus is a relatively large virus, meaning it is not truly airborne: it will settle down in respiratory droplets.
Staying two metres (six feet) away from other people is usually enough to prevent transmission through this route.
Transmission from objects can happen, for example, if someone sneezes, touches a doorknob, and then other people touch the doorknob and then touch their faces.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus may last on cardboard for up to 24 hours and on plastic for up to 3 days.
Transmission via the fecal–oral route may also be possible.
Evidence suggests that COVID-19 is contagious even without symptoms, though to what extent is still being investigated.
Common symptoms include a fever, dry cough, and fatigue.
Other less common symptoms include shortness of breath, a sore throat, headache, muscle pain, or sputum production.
Some patients have very mild symptoms, similar to a cold.
Serious complications include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multi-organ failure leading to disability or death.
About 80% of infections result in mild symptoms, while the remaining may result in hospitalization.
Case fatality rate is estimated at 1-3% of infected individuals, most of whom are elderly with underlying health conditions.
The fatality rate is much higher for those over 70 but significantly lower for those under 40.
Those most at risk of COVID-19 infection and serious complications are the elderly and those with weakened immune systems or underlying health conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer.
Not many cases are reported in children and most of these are mild or moderate, though a significant fraction do get pneumonia.
Occupationally, health care workers have higher risk compared to others with clusters of disease among workers and in health care settings.
The time between being exposed to the virus and the emergence of symptoms (incubation period) is typically between 2 and 14 days, though there has been one reported case in China where symptoms appeared 27 days after exposure.
As of February 2020, the period of infectiousness is unknown, but is likely most significant when people are symptomatic.
There is evidence of transmission from people who don't have symptoms, although to what extent is still being investigated.
It is unclear whether it is possible to be reinfected with the virus after recovering from it the first time around.
Long-term effects for people who have recovered remain unclear, but there is evidence of reduced lung capacity in some recovered patients.
Testing for the virus usually consists of a swab inserted through the nose or a throat swab which is analysed in a laboratory for the virus.
The current "gold standard" test involves extracting the genetic material from the sample and analysing it for known genetic markers of the virus.
There is no established test assessing for the virus or antibodies in the blood, although tests are being developed.
There is no test to establish immunity to the virus.
Many governments around the world have advised their citizens not to travel unnecessarily amid the pandemic.
Lots of airlines and package holidays are making it easy for you by waiving cancellation and change fees.
Particularly avoid cruise ship travel.
Older travelers and those with underlying health conditions are most at risk and should avoid travel that puts them at risk, such as long plane flights, visits to crowded places, and especially cruises, even outside of severely affected areas.
In affected areas, most experts recommend a practice known as social distancing.
This means minimising contact with others by keeping a distance of six feet or two meters from them and avoiding gathering together in groups.
Some areas permit small groups; others prohibit all group gatherings.
Measures you are encouraged to take include working from home whenever possible, avoiding crowds and avoiding leaving your home unless absolutely necessary.
If you must go out, try to stay at least 2 meters (6 feet) away from other people.
In many places these measures are required.
Follow hygiene practices like for flu prevention.
Frequently wash your hands with soap and warm water, and then dry your hands on a clean towel.
As coronaviruses are enveloped viruses, washing your hands with soap kills the virus by disrupting the mostly fat-based viral envelope.
Effective hand washing requires rubbing your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Drying your washed hands physically removes some germs from your skin (so don't skip that step, and don't share towels).
If soap and water are not available, then use a &gt;60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Alcohol is a quick germ-killer, but it's not quite instant, so this still requires the same 20 seconds of rubbing your hands together, making sure that every single scrap of skin gets wet, and then you have to wait about another minute, for the alcohol to completely dry.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with your hands.
Most people touch their faces every few minutes, all day long.
Try to do this less, and try to wash your hands before touching your face.
Also, try to avoid touching surfaces you don't have to touch in the first place, at least with your bare hands.
Cough and sneeze into your elbow or a tissue, and then immediately throw away the tissue and wash your hands.
Don't stand or sit near people who might be sick.
Stay at least one meter – and ideally two meters (six feet) – away.
As a quick way to eyeball this distance, imagine that you and the other person both reached your hands towards each other.
Could you touch the other person's hand without taking a step towards that person?
If the answer is yes, then you're too close.
Clean objects and surfaces that a lot of people touch, such as doorknobs, phones, and television remotes with regular household cleaner.
Disinfect the surfaces with a suitable disinfectant, such as diluted household bleach.
Stay home when you are sick, and avoid contact with other people until your symptoms are gone.
Do not share personal items that come into contact with saliva, such as toothbrushes, eating utensils, drinks, water bottles, and towels.
The practice of serving yourself from a common plate with your own chopsticks, common in China, should be avoided.
Greet people without touching them.
Avoid hugs, kisses, handshakes, fist bumps, and any other contact.
If it's impossible to avoid contact, then wash your hands both before and after.
It won't protect you from the coronavirus, but it will partially protect you from the flu, which remains a greater risk than COVID-19 in many areas.
This also saves you from unnecessary worry if you get the flu and think it might be the coronavirus.
If you are elderly or otherwise in a high-risk group and can be vaccinated for pneumonia, get that vaccination.
It won't protect you from viral pneumonia from COVID-19, but some COVID-19 patients have died of bacterial pneumonia that attacked their weakened lungs, so a pneumonia vaccination could save your life.
Wearing masks is recommended for those who are suspected of carrying of disease and those who are in close contact with those infected.
For those who are asymptomatic, the WHO does not recommend masks, though some national governments do.
Wearing a mask of some kind is required in some countries and cities in an effort to reduce community transmission.
There are worldwide shortages of surgical masks.
If you do wear a mask, make sure to use it correctly.
The mask should cover your nose and mouth and fit without gaps.
Wash your hands before putting on the mask and avoid touching the mask while wearing it.
If you do touch it, wash your hands immediately afterwards.
When the mask becomes damp, discard and replace it.
Remove it from the back, throw it away, and then wash your hands.
Remember that masks are not a substitute for good hygiene: continue to wash your hands frequently.
Don't stock up on masks if you don't need them.
Mask shortages mean that healthcare workers are having trouble getting a hold of masks, which puts everyone at risk.
That includes N95 respirators, which are not recommended for the general public – these are specialist equipment which must be fitted to be optimally effective.
Leave them for healthcare workers.
Avoid crowded areas, especially enclosed areas without much air circulation, such as conferences, performances, shopping malls, public transportation, and religious services.
Events which involve a large scale gathering of people, from religious pilgrimages to music concerts, are being canceled worldwide, in an effort to contain the spread of the virus.
Tourist attractions, businesses, and transportation may be closed, especially in affected countries.
Some canceled events, especially performances, sporting events, and classes, are being moved online, which means you can experience them without traveling.
At petrol/gas stations, use gloves or wipe down the handle with a disinfectant wipe if you can.
After filling up, clean your hands with hand sanitizer.
The U.S. and Canadian governments recommend avoiding travel by cruise ship.
Infections spread easily on board, and medical care is limited.
Amid a cruise ship outbreak, quarantines and docking are challenging partly due to the large number of people aboard.
Even cruise ships without confirmed cases have been denied permission to dock due to virus fears, and in the high-profile case of the Diamond Princess in Japan, hundreds of people were infected on the ship.
If you believe you may be infected, call a hospital or local emergency medical services instead of going in person to avoid infecting others.
Mention your symptoms and travel history.
Wear a medical mask and follow the instructions of authorities and doctors.

On a plane, follow the same hygiene practices as anywhere else: wash hands frequently, or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if it's not convenient to leave your seat, and avoid touching your face.
Researchers have found that passengers in window seats have less risk of contact with sick people.
Try to book a window seat, and avoid moving around the cabin during the flight.
After washing your hands and before sitting down, use disinfectant wipes to wipe down the area around your seat.
Wipe hard surfaces, and if your seat is leather you can wipe that too.
Don't wipe a cloth seat, as the moisture can make transmission easier.
When using disinfectant wipes, follow the instructions on the packaging.
And remember, viruses enter through your mouth, nose, and eyes – wiping down the area doesn't hurt, but it's not a substitute for proper hygiene.
Wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
And use a tissue to touch the touch screen or other controls.
When using the lavatory, use paper towels to turn off the faucet and open the door, then throw them away.
Airlines in affected areas are taking steps to reduce transmission and keep passengers safe.
For instance, these may include cleaning facilities more frequently, allowing flight attendants to wear masks, and serving prepackaged instead of freshly heated meals.
If a group of passengers is connecting from an area with a severe outbreak, the flight attendants may be able to seat them away from the rest of the passengers (and if you were recently in a high-risk area, consider telling the flight attendants for this reason).
You may be prohibited from changing seats on the flight.
This is so that, if someone on the flight turns out to be infected, the authorities can track down the people who were sitting near them for testing or quarantine.
COVID-19 is treated by relieving symptoms and preventing complications.
There is no vaccine or specific treatment for the novel coronavirus.
Research into a vaccine or specific antiviral drug is underway.
There are a variety of trials using HIV medications and other novel antiviral medications for treatment of COVID-19.
Mild symptoms may be relieved by taking paracetamol (acetaminophen).
If you are infected with COVID-19, countries will isolate you until several consecutive tests for COVID-19 are negative.
If you have been in close contact with someone infected with COVID-19, many countries will quarantine you for 14 days since the last exposure and monitor you for signs and symptoms.
Some countries will also test you even if you don't have symptoms.
In many countries, the healthcare system has been stretched to the point of not being able to handle the sheer number of patients, and there is a chance you may be refused treatment due to the lack of available medical staff, supplies or equipment.
Many countries have shut down or severely limited flights, ships, and border crossings, especially to and from affected areas.
Even more countries have imposed restrictions on arriving travelers, either barring entry (maybe with an exception for local citizens and permanent residents) or requiring you to be quarantined, typically for 14 days.
Even if a mandatory quarantine is not imposed, you may be asked to "self-quarantine" by staying at home and not interacting with other people.
The most severe restrictions are on travellers who have recently been to affected areas, but increasingly many countries are applying them to incoming travellers overall.
Some countries have even prohibited all or almost all foreigners from entry or limited the ability of local citizens and residents to leave.
What are the affected areas?
Well, this is a fast-changing situation, and each country/region/organization has its own list of what areas are subject to restrictions.
The city of Wuhan is on every list and the rest of mainland China is on most.
Other areas that are often included: France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Japan, Macau, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Schengen Area as a whole, and sometimes various others.
Some countries have imposed restrictions based on citizenship or residency from severely affected areas.
A detailed list of entry restrictions is maintained by the IATA.
It doesn't cover all the restrictions, but it's still useful.
Keep up to date—the outbreak and the travel restrictions are changing rapidly.
For travel in the near future, consider making refundable reservations in case the changing situation forces you to change your plans.
Avoid buying tickets with a connection in an affected area – even changing planes can make you subject to restrictions.
Flights may get canceled with little notice, either due to the disease's spread and ever-changing entry restrictions, or simply because fewer people are flying and airlines are having trouble filling seats.
You might also be delayed for hours upon arrival waiting for temperature checks and related procedures and paperwork, or even get quarantined for two weeks.
Be prepared for the possibility of disruption to your travel plans, especially if traveling internationally.
Even if you're nowhere near affected areas there's a risk that you'll have to stay at the destination longer than planned if you've shared a building or vessel with an infected person.
For example, in late February an Italian doctor on vacation in Costa Adeje (Canary Islands) was diagnosed with COVID-19, and as a result all the guests in the hotel he stayed at were quarantined.
Lockdowns and other internal restrictions
Some countries and regions, especially severely affected ones, are implementing emergency lockdowns and restrictions on people's movements and activities, even for those who haven't recently been abroad.
These include the temporary reintroduction of some border controls, restrictions on travel within the country, closing or limiting service at restaurants and other establishments, banning large public events, and in the most severe cases prohibiting people from leaving the house except for essential reasons.
Beyond government restrictions, individual establishments are shutting their doors and cancelling events to try to reduce the spread of the virus.
In China, there are extensive restrictions on transportation and activity, which vary widely by province, city, and even by district or village.
Many governments recommend against traveling to China at this time.
If you have no choice, do your research and get up-to-date information about the local situation wherever you are going.
People who have traveled to Hubei face particularly severe restrictions.
Examples of restrictions that you may encounter in some parts of China (this is not an exhaustive list):
14-day quarantine, self-quarantine, or COVID-19 test upon arrival from other parts of China or from other countries, at your expense
Questions about your travel and medical history (lying can get you years in prison)
Mandatory registration using an online or paper form
Requirement to wear a face mask in public
People who have been outside of China within 14 days not allowed into public places like malls
Shops only accept mobile payments, not cash
Restaurants, transportation and other establishments refusing service to non-Chinese citizens
Many forms of transportation reduced or shut down
Mandatory real-name registration for public transit cards
Access in and out of a town, village, or city completely blocked
Non-resident visitors prohibited from entering apartment complexes
Only allowed to go outside once every two days to get supplies
Businesses, activities, and attractions closed
Businesses need local government permission to re-open
Restaurants (if they are even open) require a minimum distance between customers
Selling substandard face masks has a maximum sentence of life imprisonment
As of mid-March 2020, Europe is the epicenter of the epidemic, and many European countries have closed their borders to international travel - only border commuters and freight are allowed to cross.
Also businesses other than food stores and pharmacies are closed, and public transport has been reduced or stopped.
In the worst affected countries including Italy, Spain and France, lockdowns like in China in January, have been implemented.
As well the EU has closed its outer borders.
COVID-19 is prevalent also in North America.
The borders between Canada, the U.S., and Mexico are closed to non-essential travel, and in many areas bans on big gatherings are in effect (this means places like restaurants are closed, and events are canceled).
Numerous state, county, and municipal jurisdictions have issued stay-at-home orders that require all nonessential businesses to close.
With lots of flights canceled, warnings issued, and restrictions imposed, flying in the time of coronavirus can be a challenge.
Some routes are not possible.
Others will require more inconvenient connections than usual—multiple stops and long waits between flights.
In some cases that means more expensive tickets.
On the other hand, the good news is that many flights are cheaper than usual due to decreased demand, and there's a decent chance you'll get an empty seat next to you.
Build in extra time for your connections, especially if transferring from an international flight to a domestic flight and especially if your itinerary involves a country that's seriously affected.
Screenings, temperature checks, extra paperwork, and the associated waiting around can add minutes or hours before you're allowed to continue on your journey.
You may find it harder than usual to buy a ticket to or from a destination subject to warnings and restrictions.
This is a real concern if you're trying to get out of an affected area.
For instance, most aggregators are not selling tickets from China to the United States (presumably to avoid falling afoul of restrictions and being on the hook for a passenger's flight out).
To buy a ticket for an itinerary like this, you may have to contact the airline or use a lesser-known aggregator.
Another possibility is to buy two separate tickets (for instance, a ticket from China to Cambodia and a second ticket from Cambodia to the U.S.), but be careful you won't get quarantined or lose your luggage in between.
Connecting flights can be a problem.
The risk of getting stuck in the connection city is higher than usual right now, due to delays for screening and testing as well as extensive cancellations.
Connecting in an affected area may lead to entry restrictions later on, and if you've been in an affected area recently some countries won't even let you change planes.
On certain itineraries there is a risk of getting quarantined somewhere along the way.
So book a direct flight if you can, and if not, think carefully about where to connect.
In uncertain times, plans can change.
Many embassies and consulates have evacuated nonessential staff, and some have shut down operations completely.
Emergency assistance should still be available, though it's possible you may have to contact a further-away consulate if your local one has shut down.
If you have been stranded due to the pandemic, your nearest consulate may be able to help you find a flight home, arrange an emergency loan so you can buy a ticket, or provide an emergency passport.
At the very least they can keep you informed about the local situation and notify you about recently introduced travel requirements and restrictions.
Ordinary consular services such as visa and passport processing may be suspended or restricted to urgent need, depending on the location and the consulate.
Although some people call the disease "Wuhan pneumonia" (武汉(漢)肺炎/武肺), "Wuhan disease", or "Chinese virus", the use of these terms is considered racist in China and by many people of Chinese origin.
It is still common to refer the disease as "Wuhan pneumonia" or "Chinese virus" in places like Hong Kong and Taiwan.
To be safe, use location-neutral terms when referring to the disease, such as "COVID-19", "novel coronavirus", or just "the virus" or "the pandemic".
Particularly in developing countries where law enforcement are poorly trained, enforcement of curfew, lockdown or stay-at-home orders are often brutal, often using forces not proportionate against crowds.
Comply with these orders, and avoid crowds in public.
As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, xenophobia has risen in many countries, primarily but not exclusively targeting people perceived to be Chinese.
There has been a worldwide spike in racist incidents targeting people of East Asian origin, including in major cities such as New York, London and San Francisco.
In Hong Kong, Sinophobia, which was already high to begin with, has intensified as a result of the pandemic, with the result that many shops and restaurants are now denying service to mainland Chinese customers and banning Mandarin speakers from their premises (with the exception of Taiwanese).
Levels of xenophobia have also risen in East Asia, with some restaurants and other businesses in Japan and China refusing service to foreign customers.
In China, there have been incidents of foreigners being refused rooms by hotel staff, and foreign residents, particularly black people, being kicked out of their apartments on short notice by their landlords.

A variety of misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus are being promoted online and even by some government officials, so be careful which sources you check for information.
Ensure that all information and advice you receive has been backed by reputable doctors and scientists.
In a crisis, it's natural to want to keep following the latest updates, but it may be better for your mental health to moderate the amount of news that you look at, and stick to reliable news sources.
If you normally watch the news twice per day then stick to this schedule and do something else, rather than having the 24-hour news on continuously.
B'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ACE2 counters the activity of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang(1-7) making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular diseases.
ACE2 also serves as the entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of cells in lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood stream and ultimately excreted into urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of mainly lung type II alveolar cells, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a counter balance to ACE.
ACE cleaves angiotensin I hormone into the vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 in turn cleaves the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also cleave a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane trafficking of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been implicated in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells results in endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into endosomes located within cells.
This entry process also requires priming of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is under current investigation as a potential therapeutic.
This has led some to hypothesize that decreasing the levels of ACE2, in cells, might help in fighting the infection.
However, multiple professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that "use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in risk of pneumonia compared with controls."
Moreover, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk of pneumonia, in particular those with stroke and heart failure.
Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia related mortality, although the results were less robust than for overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is surmised to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with a lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in human beings is about 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the course of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where circulating angiotensin II is elevated.
Infused rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
B'Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1 (Bat SL-CoV-WIV1), also sometimes called SARS-like coronavirus WIV1, is a strain of Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) isolated from Chinese rufous horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus).
Like all coronaviruses, virions consist of single-stranded positive-sense RNA enclosed within an envelope.
The discovery confirms that bats are the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis shows the possibility of direct transmission of SARS from bats to humans without the intermediary Chinese civets, as previously believed.
B'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to aid contact tracing in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying persons ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected individual.
Numerous applications were developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for building contact tracing apps have been developed.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially about systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of app users.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in conjunction with Alipay, has deployed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people that have COVID-19.
It is in use across more than 200 Chinese cities.
In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government.
North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to trace exposure with potentially infected persons and provide a fast response to healthcare authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracing app was in an advanced stage of development, and would be available for deployment within weeks.
A similar app is planned in Ireland, and in France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.
Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, listed a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if takeup of the app is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple set limits on which types of organizations could add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, limiting them to only "official" or otherwise reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners voiced their concern regarding the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, in particular about whether surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.
The organisations declared eight conditions on governmental projects:
Surveillance would have to be "lawful, necessary and proportionate";
Extensions of monitoring and surveillance would have to have sunset clauses;
The use of data would have to be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data security and anonymity would have to be protected and shown to be protected based on evidence;
Digital surveillance would have to avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalisation;
Any sharing of data with third parties would have to be defined in law;
There would have to be safeguards against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuses;
Meaningful participation by all "relevant stakeholders" would be required, including that of public health experts and marginalised groups.
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also issued checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan intends to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracing mechanism from their device operating systems once it is no longer needed.
Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to perform contact tracing.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system gathered tracking information from a variety of sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined these to generate notices via text messages to potentially-infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made the location information publicly available, something permitted because of far-reaching changes to information privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public via a number of apps and websites.
Countries including Germany considered using both centralized and privacy-preserving systems.
As of 6 April 2020, the details had not yet been released.
Privacy-preserving contact tracing is a well-established concept, with a substantial body of research literature dating back to at least 2013.
As of 7 April 2020, over a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
However, PEPP-PT is a co-ordination effort which contains both centralised and decentralised approaches, and is not a single protocol.
Decentralised protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all matching happens on-device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has been developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or path intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the whitepaper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020.
Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technologies that was also originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace utilizes secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the global TCN Coalition was founded by groups that had coalesced around what was essentially the same approach and largely overlapping protocols, with the goal to reduce fragmentation, and enable global interoperability of tracing and alerting apps, a key aspect of achieving widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singaporean government announced that it had open-sourced the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing, which they claimed would preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy-preserving cryptography.
They also published specifications of the core technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be rolled out in three stages:
Rollout of tools to enable governments to create official privacy-preserving coronavirus tracing apps
Integration of this functionality directly into iOS and AndroidGoogle and Apple plan to address the take-up and persistent surveillance problems by first distributing the system through operating system updates, and later removing it in the same way once the threat has passed.
B'COVID-19 drug development is the research process to develop a preventative vaccine or therapeutic prescription drug that would alleviate the severity of 2019-20 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The International Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the WHO recorded 536 clinical studies to develop post-infection therapies for COVID-19 infections, with numerous established antiviral compounds for treating other infections under clinical research to be repurposed.
In March, the WHO initiated the "SOLIDARITY Trial" in 10 countries, enrolling thousands of people infected with COVID-19 to assess treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promise of efficacy.
A dynamic, systematic review was established in April 2020 to track the progress of registered clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic drug candidates.
Vaccine and drug development is a multistep process, typically requiring more than five years to assure safety and efficacy of the new compound.
Drug development is the process of bringing a new infectious disease vaccine or therapeutic drug to the market once a lead compound has been identified through the process of drug discovery.
It includes laboratory research on microorganisms and animals, filing for regulatory status, such as via the FDA, for an investigational new drug to initiate clinical trials on humans, and may include the step of obtaining regulatory approval with a new drug application to market the drug.
Development of a COVID-19 vaccine or therapeutic antiviral drug begins with matching a chemical concept to the potential prophylactic mechanism of the future vaccine or antiviral activity in vivo.
New chemical entities (NCEs, also known as new molecular entities or NMEs) are compounds that emerge from the process of drug discovery to specify a vaccine or antiviral candidate.
These have promising activity against a biological target related to COVID-19 disease.
At the beginning of vaccine or drug development, little is known about the safety, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of the NCE in humans.
It is the function and obligation of drug development to assess all of these parameters prior to human clinical trials to prove safety and efficacy.
A further major objective of drug development is to recommend the dose and schedule for the first use in a human clinical trial ("first-in-human" [FIH] or First Human Dose [FHD], previously also known as "first-in-man" [FIM]).
In addition, drug development must establish the physicochemical properties of the NCE: its chemical makeup, stability, and solubility.
Manufacturers must optimize the process they use to make the chemical so they can scale up from a medicinal chemist producing milligrams, to manufacturing on the kilogram and ton scale.
They further examine the product for suitability to package as capsules, tablets, aerosol, intramuscular injectable, subcutaneous injectable, or intravenous formulations.
Together, these processes are known in preclinical and clinical development as chemistry, manufacturing, and control (CMC).
Many aspects of drug development focus on satisfying the regulatory requirements of drug licensing authorities.
These generally constitute tests designed to determine the major toxicities of a novel compound prior to first use in humans.
The Canadian government announced CA$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including numerous vaccine candidates at Canadian universities, with plans to establish a "vaccine bank" of new vaccines for implementation if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
Clinical trial programs involve three, multiple-year stages toward product approval, and a fourth, post-approval stage for ongoing safety monitoring of the vaccine or drug therapy:
Phase I trials, usually in healthy volunteers, determine safety and dosing.
Phase II trials are used to establish an initial reading of efficacy and further explore safety in small numbers of people having the disease targeted by the NCE.
Phase III trials are large, pivotal trials to determine safety and efficacy in sufficiently large numbers of people with the COVID-19 infection.
If safety and efficacy are adequately proved, clinical testing may stop at this step and the NCE advances to the new drug application (NDA) stage to begin marketing.
Phase IV trials are post-approval trials that may be a condition attached by the FDA, also called post-market surveillance studies.
In addition to the tests required to move a novel vaccine or antiviral drug into the clinic for the first time, manufacturers must ensure that any long-term or chronic toxicities are well-defined, including effects on systems not previously monitored (fertility, reproduction, immune system, among others).
In the United States, this process is called a "new drug application" or NDA.
A clinical trial design in progress may be modified as an "adaptive design" if accumulating data in the trial provide early insights about positive or negative efficacy of the treatment.
The global Solidarity and European Discovery trials of hospitalized people with severe COVID-19 infection apply adaptive design to rapidly alter trial parameters as results from the four experimental therapeutic strategies emerge.
Adaptive designs within ongoing Phase II-III clinical trials on candidate therapeutics may shorten trial durations and use fewer subjects, possibly expediting decisions for early termination or success, and coordinating design changes for a specific trial across its international locations.
Most novel drug candidates (NCEs) fail during drug development, either because they have unacceptable toxicity or because they simply do not prove efficacy on the targeted disease, as shown in Phase II-III clinical trials.
The high failure rates associated with pharmaceutical development are referred to as an "attrition rate", requiring decisions during the early stages of drug development to "kill" projects early to avoid costly failures.
One 2010 study assessed both capitalized and out-of-pocket costs for bringing a single new drug to market as about US$1.8 billion and $870 million, respectively.
A median cost estimate of 2015-16 trials for development of 10 anti-cancer drugs was $648 million.
In a 2016 review of 106 drug candidates assessed through clinical trials, the total capital expenditure for a manufacturer having a drug approved through successful Phase III trials was $2.6 billion (in 2013 dollars), an amount increasing at an annual rate of 8.5%.
Seven trials were evaluating repurposed drugs already approved to treat malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine phosphate.
Repurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the Chinese research, with 9 Phase III trials on remdesivir across several countries due to report by the end of April.
Led by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with partners investing US$125 million and coordinating with the World Health Organization, the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator began in March, facilitating drug development researchers to rapidly identify, assess, develop, and scale up potential treatments.
The COVID-19 Clinical Research Coalition formed to coordinate and expedite results from international clinical trials on the most promising post-infection treatments.
In early 2020, numerous established antiviral compounds for treating other infections were being repurposed or developed in new clinical research efforts to alleviate the illness of COVID-19.
For an already-approved drug (such as hydroxychloroquine for malaria), Phase III-IV trials determine in hundreds to thousands of COVID-19-infected people the possible extended use of an already-approved drug for treating COVID-19 infection.
As of early April 2020, 103 candidate therapeutics were in preclinical or a stage of Phase I-IV development, with trial results for 29 drug candidates expected during April.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the coordinated "Solidarity trial" in 10 countries to rapidly assess in thousands of COVID-19 infected people the potential efficacy of existing antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents not yet evaluated specifically for COVID-19 illness.
Do any of the drugs reduce mortality?
Do any of the drugs reduce the time a patient is hospitalized?
Do the treatments affect the need for people with COVID-19-induced pneumonia to be ventilated or maintained in intensive care?
Could such drugs be used to minimize the illness of COVID-19 infection in healthcare staff and people at high risk of developing severe illness?Enrolling people with COVID-19 infection is simplified by using data entries, including informed consent, on a WHO website.
After the trial staff determines the drugs available at the hospital, the WHO website randomizes the hospitalized subject to one of the trial drugs or to the hospital standard of care for treating COVID-19.
The trial physician records and submits follow-up information about the subject status and treatment, completing data input via the WHO Solidarity website.
A global safety monitoring board of WHO physicians examine interim results to assist decisions on safety and effectiveness of the trial drugs, and alter the trial design or recommend an effective therapy.
A similar web-based study to Solidarity, called "Discovery", was initiated in March across seven countries by INSERM (Paris, France).
During March, funding for the Solidarity trial reached US$108 million from 203,000 individuals, organizations and governments, with 45 countries involved in financing or trial management.
Numerous candidate drugs under study as "supportive" treatments to relieve discomfort during illness, such as NSAIDs or bronchodilators, are not included in the table below.
Others in early-stage Phase II trials or numerous treatment candidates in Phase I trials, are also excluded.
Drug candidates in Phase I-II trials have a low rate of success (under 12%) to pass through all trial phases to gain eventual approval.
Hydroxychloroquine is more commonly available than chloroquine in the United States.
Although several countries use chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for treatment of persons hospitalized with COVID-19, as of March 2020 the drug has not been formally approved through clinical trials in the United States.
Chloroquine has been recommended by Chinese, South Korean and Italian health authorities for the treatment of COVID-19, although these agencies and the US CDC noted contraindications for people with heart disease or diabetes.
Both drugs have extensive interactions with prescription drugs, affecting the therapeutic dose and disease mitigation.
Some people have allergic reactions to these drugs.
On 12 April, a preliminary clinical trial conducted at a hospital in Brazil was stopped when several people given high doses of chloroquine for COVID-19 infection developed irregular heart rates, causing 11 deaths.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
Of 35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative in a median of 4 days, while the length of illness was 11 days in the 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia half were given favipiravir and half received umifenovir.
The term "preclinical research" is defined by laboratory studies in vitro and in vivo, indicating a beginning stage for development of a vaccine, antiviral or monoclonal antibody therapy, such as experiments to determine effective doses and toxicity, before a candidate compound is advanced for safety and efficacy evaluation in humans.
Some antibiotics may be repurposed as COVID-19 treatments:
In March 2020, the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was identified as a target for post-infection drugs.
This enzyme is essential to the host cell to reproduce the ribonucleic acid of the virus.
To find the enzyme, scientists used the genome published by Chinese researchers in January 2020 to isolate the main protease.
As a potential combination therapy, they are used together in two Phase III arms of the 2020 global Solidarity project on COVID-19.
A preliminary study in China of combined lopinavir and ritonavir found no effect in people hospitalized for COVID-19.
B'Drug repositioning (also known as drug repurposing, re-profiling, re-tasking or therapeutic switching) is the repurposing of an approved drug for the treatment of a different disease or medical condition than that for which it was originally developed.
This is one line of scientific research which is currently being pursued to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma transfusion.
SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 druggable proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
Analyzing those binding sites provide the reasonable project of developing effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like protease, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A A, et al studied several candidate compounds which then optimized and analyzed for their skeleton similarity with the highest similar approved drugs in order to accelerate a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug development in his preclinical study to be recommended in a clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial medication that is also used against some auto-immune diseases.
On 18 March, the WHO announced that chloroquine and the related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on 24 March.
On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA's clinical trials process and is authorized under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but are not able to receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC has said that "the use, dosing, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" are not yet established.
Doctors have said they are using the drug when "there's no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of preventative use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show favipiravir was "clearly effective".
35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative in a median of 4 days, while the length of illness was 11 days in the 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half were given favipiravir and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence in support of the drug is scant and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan for its stockpile, and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made overtures to the Trump administration about purchasing the drug.
The drug may be less effective in severe cases of illness where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or those trying to conceive.
One study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV from replicating by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that will bind with the protease of SARS-CoV-2.
There are criticisms within the scientific community about directing resources to repurposing drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections.
Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple filo-, pneumo-, paramyxo-, and corona- viruses.
One issue with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pretrial studies suggest remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance.
There are several clinical trials underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one for people with moderate illness and another for those with more severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19; two placebo controlled (China, Canada) and one with no control (Italy).
New York State began trials for the antibiotic azithromycin on 24 March 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for Teijin's Alvesco (ciclesonide), an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the novel coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a Phase II trial is underway with 200 patients to be recruited from severe, hospitalized cases in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients suffering from mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, named COLCORONA, is recruiting 6000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and experience mild symptoms not requiring hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who do not have an effective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is being widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study on 300 patients researching the use of enoxaparin sodium at prophylaxis and therapeutic dosages was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on repurposing approved anti-viral drugs that were developed for prior outbreaks such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially repurposable as COVID-19 treatments:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by China.
Also trials in Italy and China. and see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
It is unclear yet whether conditions arising during pregnancy including diabetes, cardiac failure, hypercoagulability or hypertension might represent additional risk factors for pregnant people as they do for nonpregnant people.
From the limited data available, vertical transmission during the third trimester probably does not occur, or only occurs very rarely.
There is no data yet on early pregnancy.
Little evidence exists to permit any solid conclusions about the nature of COVID-19 infection in pregnancy.
A case series of 43 women from New York who tested positive for COVID-19 showed similar patterns to non-pregnant adults: 86% had mild disease, 9.3% had severe disease and 4.7% developed critical disease.
Fetal distress was reported in two.
None of the women developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died.
All of them had live birth pregnancies and no severe neonatal asphyxia was observed.
The samples of breast milk, amniotic fluid, cord blood and neonatal throat swab were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all results were negative.
In another study on 15 pregnant women, majority of the patients presented with fever and cough, while laboratory tests yielded lymphocytopenia in 12 patients.
Computed tomography findings of these patients were consistent with previous reports of non-pregnant patients, consisting of ground-glass opacities at early stage.
Follow-up images after delivery showed no progression of pneumonia.
Media reports indicate that over 100 women with COVID-19 might have delivered, and in March 2020, no maternal deaths were reported.
Their guidelines thus advise that any pregnant person admitted to hospital with a COVID-19 infection should receive at least 10 days of prophylactic low-molecular-weight heparin after being discharged from the hospital.
There are no data yet concerning the implications of COVID-19 infections for labour.
One infant girl born to a mother with COVID-19 had elevated IgM levels two hours after birth, suggesting that she had been infected in utero and supporting the possibility of vertical transmission in some cases.
A small study involving 6 confirmed COVID-19 mothers showed no indication of SARS-COV-19 in their newborns' throats or serum but antibodies were present in neonatal blood sera samples, including IgM in two of the infants.
This is not usually passed from mother to fetus so further research is required to know whether the virus crossed the placenta or whether placentas of women in the study were damaged or abnormal.
Since COVID-19 shows similarities to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it is likely that their effect on pregnancy are similar.
Four of seven had first trimester miscarriage, two of five had fetal growth restriction in the second trimester, and four of five had preterm birth.
None of the newborns were infected with SARS-CoV.
A report of ten cases of MERS- CoV infection in pregnancy in Saudi Arabia showed that the clinical presentation is variable, from mild to severe infection.
The outcome was favorable in a majority of the cases, but the infant death rate was 27%.
A recent review suggested that COVID-19 appeared to be less lethal to mothers and infants than SARS and MERS but that there may be an increased risk of preterm birth after 28 weeks' gestation.
The World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States advises pregnant women to do the same things as the general public to avoid infection, such as covering cough, avoid interacting with sick people, cleaning hands with soap and water or sanitizer.
A survey conducted in Shanghai among pregnant women in different trimesters of pregnancy identified a strong demand for online access to health information and services.
People expecting their first baby were more willing to have online consultation and guidance than who had previously given birth.
The RCOG and RCM recommend that in-person appointments be deferred by 7 days after the start of symptoms of COVID-19 or 14 days if another person in the household has symptoms.
Fever subsequently developed in three asymptomatic patients.
One patient who had tested negative subsequently became symptomatic postpartum and tested positive three days after the initial negative test.
The doctors conducting the screening recommended that in order to reduce infection and allocate PPE, due to high numbers of patients presenting as asymptomatic, universal screening of pregnant patients should be conducted.
They also suggest that people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should have continuous electronic fetal monitoring.
The use of birthing pools is not recommended for suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 due to the risk of infection via faeces.
In the UK, official recommendations state that precautionary separation of a mother and a healthy baby should not be undertaken lightly and that they should be kept together in the postpartum period where neonatal care is not required.
Literature from China recommended separation of infected mothers from babies for 14 days.
In the US there is also the recommendation that newborns and mothers should be temporarily separated until transmission-based precautions are discontinued, and that where this is not possible the newborn should be kept 2 metres away from the mother.
B'COVID-19 surveillance involves monitoring the spread of the coronavirus disease in order to establish the patterns of disease progression.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends active surveillance, with focus of case finding, testing and contact tracing in all transmission scenarios.
COVID-19 surveillance is expected to monitor epidemiological trends, rapidly detect new cases, and based on this information, provide epidemiological information to conduct risk assessment and guide disease preparedness.
Syndromic surveillance is done based on the symptoms of an individual that corresponds to COVID-19.
As of March 2020, the WHO recommends the following case definitions:
Probable case: "A suspect case for whom testing for the COVID-19 virus is inconclusive" OR "a suspect case for whom testing could not be performed for any reason".
Confirmed case: "A person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms".
Direct physical contact with a probable or confirmed case;
Direct care for a patient with probable or confirmed COVID-19 disease without using proper personal protective equipment;
Other situations as indicated by local risk assessments".
WHO recommends reporting of probable and confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection within 48 hours of identification.
The countries should report on a case-by-case basis as far as possible, but in case of limitation in resources, aggregate weekly reporting is also possible.
Some organizations have created crowdsourced apps for syndromic surveillance, where people can report their symptoms to help researchers map areas with concentration of COVID-19 symptoms.
Virological surveillance is done by using molecular tests for COVID-19.
WHO has published resources for laboratories on how to perform testing for COVID-19.
In the European Union, laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 are reported within 24 hours of identification.
At least 24 countries have established digital surveillance of their citizens.
The digital surveillance technologies include apps, location data and electronic tags.
The Center For Disease Control and Prevention in USA tracks the travel information of individuals using airline passenger data.
In Hong Kong, authorities are requiring a bracelet and an app for all travellers.
A GPS app is used to track the locations of individuals in South Korea to ensure against quarantine breach, sending alerts to the user and to authorities if people leave designated areas.
In Singapore, individuals have to report their locations with photographic proof.
Thailand is using an app and SIM cards for all travelers to enforce their quarantine.
Human rights organizations have criticized some of these measures, asking the governments not to use the pandemic as a cover to introduce invasive digital surveillance.
B'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are multiple attempts in progress to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to become available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to considerable investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Stated in April, imperatives of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, deployment at scale, and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Major platform targets advanced into Phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are in early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (presumed to be in planning or being designed).
A Phase I-II trial conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing, is typically randomized, placebo-controlled, and at multiple sites, while determining more precise, effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and test effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while monitoring for adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (still in "preclinical" research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins in order to stimulate an immune reaction.

In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company announced they will have pre-clinical testing results in April 2020 and their final vaccine candidate could begin human testing by fall.
In France on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced a US$4.9 million investment in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI's total investment in COVID-19 vaccine development to US$29 million.
CEPI's other investment partners for COVID-19 vaccine development are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have begun animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Imperial College London researchers announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including numerous vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically for developing a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on testing of PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines elicited potent antigen-specific antibody responses [in the mice] that were evident beginning 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a possible nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, the DNA will be designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which may stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities pooled resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
A further randomized trial in Australia is seeking to enrol 4,170 healthcare workers.
It is possible vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
Early research to assess vaccine efficacy using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, indicate a need for biosafety-level 3 containment measures for handling live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became prevalent, it was believed that existing SARS research may provide a useful template for developing vaccines and therapeutics against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA based) MERS vaccine which completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others in progress, all of which are viral-vectored vaccines, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory claiming the virus behind COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social media posts reference existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as the SARS coronavirus.
B'Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds.
In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal.
Mild illnesses include some cases of the common cold (which has other possible causes, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.
Symptoms in other species vary: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea.
There are yet to be vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.
Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria.
They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry.
The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among RNA viruses.
They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona from which their name derives.
Coronaviruses were first discovered in the 1930s when an acute respiratory infection of domesticated chickens was shown to be caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV).
In the 1940s, two more animal coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), were isolated.
Human coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s.
The earliest ones studied were from human patients with the common cold, which were later named human coronavirus 229E and human coronavirus OC43.
They were first imaged by Scottish virologist June Almeida at St. Thomas Hospital in London.
Other human coronaviruses have since been identified, including SARS-CoV in 2003, HCoV NL63 in 2004, HKU1 in 2005, MERS-CoV in 2012, and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019.
Most of these have involved serious respiratory tract infections.
The name was first used in 1968 by an informal group of virologists in the journal Nature to designate the new family of viruses.
The name refers to the characteristic appearance of virions (the infective form of the virus) by electron microscopy, which have a fringe of large, bulbous surface projections creating an image reminiscent of a crown or of a solar corona.
This morphology is created by the viral spike peplomers, which are proteins on the surface of the virus.
Coronaviruses are large pleomorphic spherical particles with bulbous surface projections.
The envelope of the virus in electron micrographs appears as a distinct pair of electron dense shells.
The viral envelope consists of a lipid bilayer where the membrane (M), envelope (E) and spike (S) structural proteins are anchored.
The lipid bilayer envelope, membrane proteins, and nucleocapsid protect the virus when it is outside the host cell.
Coronaviruses contain a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome.
The genome size for coronaviruses ranges from 26.4 to 31.7 kilobases.
The genome size is one of the largest among RNA viruses.
The open reading frames 1a and 1b, which occupy the first two-thirds of the genome, encode the replicase/transcriptase polyprotein.
The replicase/transcriptase polyprotein self cleaves to form nonstructural proteins.
The later reading frames encode the four major structural proteins: spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid.
Interspersed between these reading frames are the reading frames for the accessory proteins.
The number of accessory proteins and their function is unique depending on the specific coronavirus.
Infection begins when the viral spike (S) glycoprotein attaches to its complementary host cell receptor.
After attachment, a protease of the host cell cleaves and activates the receptor-attached spike protein.
Depending on the host cell protease available, cleavage and activation allows the virus to enter the host cell by endocytosis or direct fusion of the viral envelop with the host membrane.
On entry into the host cell, the virus particle is uncoated, and its genome enters the cell cytoplasm.
The host ribosome translates the initial overlapping open reading frame of the virus genome and forms a long polyprotein.
The polyprotein has its own proteases which cleave the polyprotein into multiple nonstructural proteins.
A number of the nonstructural proteins coalesce to form a multi-protein replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC).
The main replicase-transcriptase protein is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).
It is directly involved in the replication and transcription of RNA from an RNA strand.
The other nonstructural proteins in the complex assist in the replication and transcription process.
The exoribonuclease nonstructural protein, for instance, provides extra fidelity to replication by providing a proofreading function which the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase lacks.
One of the main functions of the complex is to replicate the viral genome.
RdRp directly mediates the synthesis of negative-sense genomic RNA from the positive-sense genomic RNA.
This is followed by the replication of positive-sense genomic RNA from the negative-sense genomic RNA.
The other important function of the complex is to transcribe the viral genome.
RdRp directly mediates the synthesis of negative-sense subgenomic RNA molecules from the positive-sense genomic RNA.
This is followed by the transcription of these negative-sense subgenomic RNA molecules to their corresponding positive-sense mRNAs.
The replicated positive-sense genomic RNA becomes the genome of the progeny viruses.
The mRNAs are gene transcripts of the last third of the virus genome after the initial overlapping reading frame.
These mRNAs are translated by the host's ribosomes into the structural proteins and a number of accessory proteins.
RNA translation occurs inside the endoplasmic reticulum.
The viral structural proteins S, E, and M move along the secretory pathway into the Golgi intermediate compartment.
There, the M proteins direct most protein-protein interactions required for assembly of viruses following its binding to the nucleocapsid.
Progeny viruses are then released from the host cell by exocytosis through secretory vesicles.
The interaction of the coronavirus spike protein with its complement host cell receptor is central in determining the tissue tropism, infectivity, and species range of the virus.
The SARS coronavirus, for example, infects human cells by attaching to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.
The scientific name for coronavirus is Orthocoronavirinae or Coronavirinae.
Coronaviruses belong to the family of Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria.
Genus Betacoronavirus; type species: Murine coronavirus
Species: Betacoronavirus 1 (Bovine Coronavirus, Human coronavirus OC43), Human coronavirus HKU1, Murine coronavirus, Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5, Rousettus bat coronavirus HKU9, Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2), Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, Hedgehog coronavirus 1 (EriCoV)
Species: Beluga whale coronavirus SW1, Infectious bronchitis virus
The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all coronaviruses is estimated to have existed as recently as 8000 BCE, although some models place the common ancestor as far back as 55 million years or more, implying long term coevolution with bat and avian species.
The most recent common ancestor of the alphacoronavirus line has been placed at about 2400 BCE, the betacoronavirus line at 3300 BCE, the gammacoronavirus line at 2800 BCE, and the deltacoronavirus line at about 3000 BCE.
The large number of host bat and avian species, and their global range, has enabled extensive evolution and dissemination of coronaviruses.
Many human coronavirus have their origin in bats.
More recently, alpaca coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E diverged sometime before 1960.
MERS-CoV emerged in humans from bats through the intermediate host of camels.
MERS-CoV, although related to several bat coronavirus species, appears to have diverged from these several centuries ago.
The most closely related bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV diverged in 1986.
A possible path of evolution, of SARS coronavirus and keen bat coronaviruses, suggests that SARS related coronaviruses coevolved in bats for a long time.
In the 1790s, equine coronavirus diverged from the bovine coronavirus after a cross-species jump.
Later in the 1890s, human coronavirus OC43 diverged from bovine coronavirus after another cross-species spillover event.
It is speculated that the flu pandemic of 1890 may have been caused by this spillover event, and not by the influenza virus, because of the related timing, neurological symptoms, and unknown causative agent of the pandemic.
Human coronavirus OC43 besides causing respiratory infections is also suspected of playing a role in neurological diseases.
In the 1950s, the human coronavirus OC43 began to diverge into its present genotypes.
Phylogentically, mouse hepatitis virus (Murine coronavirus), which infects the mouse's liver and the central nervous system, is related to human coronavirus OC43 and bovine coronavirus.
Human coronavirus HKU1, like the aforementioned viruses, also has its origins in rodents.
Coronaviruses vary significantly in risk factor.
Some can kill more than 30% of those infected, such as MERS-CoV, and some are relatively harmless, such as the common cold.
Coronaviruses can cause colds with major symptoms, such as fever, and a sore throat from swollen adenoids.
Coronaviruses can cause pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia) and bronchitis (either direct viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis).
The human coronavirus discovered in 2003, SARS-CoV, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has a unique pathogenesis because it causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections.
Six species of human coronaviruses are known, with one species subdivided into two different strains, making seven strains of human coronaviruses altogether.
Four of these coronaviruses continually circulate in the human population and produce the generally mild symptoms of the common cold in adults and children worldwide: -OC43, -HKU1, HCoV-229E, -NL63.
Coronaviruses cause about 15% of commons colds.
The majority of colds are caused by rhinoviruses.
The four mild coronaviruses have a seasonal incidence occurring in the winter months in temperate climates.
There is no preference towards a particular season in tropical climates.
Four human coronaviruses produce symptoms that are generally mild:
The virus was officially named the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).
More than 8,000 people were infected, about ten percent of whom died.
In September 2012, a new type of coronavirus was identified, initially called Novel Coronavirus 2012, and now officially named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
The World Health Organization issued a global alert soon after.
The WHO update on 28 September 2012 said the virus did not seem to pass easily from person to person.
However, on 12 May 2013, a case of human-to-human transmission in France was confirmed by the French Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
In addition, cases of human-to-human transmission were reported by the Ministry of Health in Tunisia.
Two confirmed cases involved people who seemed to have caught the disease from their late father, who became ill after a visit to Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
Despite this, it appears the virus had trouble spreading from human to human, as most individuals who are infected do not transmit the virus.
The final name for the virus is Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
The only U.S. cases (both survived) were recorded in May 2014.In May 2015, an outbreak of MERS-CoV occurred in the Republic of Korea, when a man who had traveled to the Middle East, visited four hospitals in the Seoul area to treat his illness.
This caused one of the largest outbreaks of MERS-CoV outside the Middle East.
As of December 2019, 2,468 cases of MERS-CoV infection had been confirmed by laboratory tests, 851 of which were fatal, a mortality rate of approximately 34.5%.
In December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China.
On 31 December 2019, the outbreak was traced to a novel strain of coronavirus, which was given the interim name 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO), later renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.
Some researchers have suggested the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market may not be the original source of viral transmission to humans.
As of 17 April 2020, there have been at least 153,822 confirmed deaths and more than 2,240,191 confirmed cases in the coronavirus pneumonia pandemic.
The Wuhan strain has been identified as a new strain of Betacoronavirus from group 2B with approximately 70% genetic similarity to the SARS-CoV.
The virus has a 96% similarity to a bat coronavirus, so it is widely suspected to originate from bats as well.
The pandemic has resulted in travel restrictions and nationwide lockdowns in several countries.
Coronaviruses have been recognized as causing pathological conditions in veterinary medicine since the 1930s.
Except for avian infectious bronchitis, the major related diseases have mainly an intestinal location.
Coronaviruses primarily infect the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of mammals and birds.
They also cause a range of diseases in farm animals and domesticated pets, some of which can be serious and are a threat to the farming industry.
In chickens, the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a coronavirus, targets not only the respiratory tract but also the urogenital tract.
The virus can spread to different organs throughout the chicken.
Economically significant coronaviruses of farm animals include porcine coronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, TGE) and bovine coronavirus, which both result in diarrhea in young animals.
Feline coronavirus: two forms, feline enteric coronavirus is a pathogen of minor clinical significance, but spontaneous mutation of this virus can result in feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a disease associated with high mortality.
Similarly, there are two types of coronavirus that infect ferrets: Ferret enteric coronavirus causes a gastrointestinal syndrome known as epizootic catarrhal enteritis (ECE), and a more lethal systemic version of the virus (like FIP in cats) known as ferret systemic coronavirus (FSC).
There are two types of canine coronavirus (CCoV), one that causes mild gastrointestinal disease and one that has been found to cause respiratory disease.
Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a coronavirus that causes an epidemic murine illness with high mortality, especially among colonies of laboratory mice.
Sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) is highly infectious coronavirus of laboratory rats, which can be transmitted between individuals by direct contact and indirectly by aerosol.
Some strains of MHV cause a progressive demyelinating encephalitis in mice which has been used as a murine model for multiple sclerosis.
Significant research efforts have been focused on elucidating the viral pathogenesis of these animal coronaviruses, especially by virologists interested in veterinary and zoonotic diseases.
Porcine coronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus of pigs, TGEV).
Bovine coronavirus (BCV), responsible for severe profuse enteritis in of young calves.
Feline coronavirus (FCoV) causes mild enteritis in cats as well as severe Feline infectious peritonitis (other variants of the same virus).
The two types of canine coronavirus (CCoV) (one causing enteritis, the other found in respiratory diseases).
Turkey coronavirus (TCV) causes enteritis in turkeys.
Ferret enteric coronavirus causes epizootic catarrhal enteritis in ferrets.
Ferret systemic coronavirus causes FIP-like systemic syndrome in ferrets.
Rabbit enteric coronavirus causes acute gastrointestinal disease and diarrhea in young European rabbits.
Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PED or PEDV), has emerged around the world.
B'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.
While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.
The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact, often via small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
While these droplets are produced when breathing out, they usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than being infectious over long distances.
People may also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for mask use by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending against their use, some recommending their use, and others requiring their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.
Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented only with chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease may progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.
Reports indicate that not all who are infected develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not display symptoms is currently unknown and being studied, with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Loud talking releases more droplets than normal talking.
A study in Singapore found that an uncovered cough can lead to droplets travelling up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Though the virus is not generally airborne, the National Academy of Science has suggested that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and air collectors positioned in the hallway outside of people's rooms yielded samples positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be aerosolised and thus result in airborne spread.
While there are concerns it may spread via feces, this risk is believed to be low.
The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; while spread may be possible before symptoms emerge, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.
The virus survives for hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for one day on cardboard, for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and for up to four hours on 99% copper.
This, however, varies depending on the humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if correctly used; soap products degrade the virus' fatty protective layer, deactivating it, as well as freeing them from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective.
In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken a median of two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day tested.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.
SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted in hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe disease.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms is high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis.
Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 have found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so laboratories across the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infections and whether a person had been infected in the past) were in development, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese experience with testing has shown the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month.
Diagnostic guidelines released by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting infections based upon clinical features and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in early infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
Few data are available about microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings at autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, lung consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multinucleated giant cell formation
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Healing pneumonia: organisation of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least 20 seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available.
Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged.
The CDC has recommended the use of cloth face coverings in public settings, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals.
Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected persons with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
Distancing guidelines also include that people stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There is no medication known to be effective at preventing COVID-19.
As a vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest, a key part of managing COVID-19 is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's nose, coughing or sneezing.
It further recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available.
For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a humectant.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they carry the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the issue of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may be useful in those with mild symptoms at the early stage of infection.
The WHO and Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for taking care of people who are hospitalised with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the U.S. have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions must be taken to minimise the risk of virus transmission, especially in healthcare settings when performing procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne precautions.
The CDC outlines the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended gear is: PPE gown, respirator or facemask, eye protection, and medical gloves.
When available, respirators (instead of facemasks) are preferred.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial settings but the FDA has authorised the masks for use under an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
They are designed to protect from airborne particles like dust but effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for off-label uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19 related respiratory failure is being actively studied for people in hospital.
With some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure.
Whether either of these two leads to the same benefit for people who are critically ill is not known.
Some doctors prefer staying with invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to a high flow nasal cannula.
Severe cases are most common in older adults (those older than 60 years, and especially those older than 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits a health system's capacity to handle a sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalisation.
One study in China found 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support of ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people in hospital with COVID-19 are eventually admitted to ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators capable of pressure control modes and high PEEP are needed to maximise oxygen delivery while minimising the risk of ventilator-associated lung injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.
Research into potential treatments started in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir appears to be the most promising.
Although new medications may take until 2021 to develop, several of the medications being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antiviral medication may be tried in people with severe disease.
The WHO recommended volunteers take part in trials of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments.
The FDA has granted temporary authorisation to convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not undergone the clinical studies needed to show it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the disease outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect'close contact' using surveillance data and therefore a potential risk of infection.
Every user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, it also alerts local health officials.
Big data analytics on cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people whom they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to track mobile phone data of people supposed to have coronavirus.
The measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect those who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia deployed facial recognition technology to detect quarantine breakers.
Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he has been informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are continuing to move around anyway".
German government conducted a 48 hours weekend hackathon with more than 42.000 participants.
Also the president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
Individuals may experience distress from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of the infection itself.
BBC quoted Rory O'Connor in saying, "Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and an economic downturn are a perfect storm to harm people's mental health and wellbeing."
The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk for severe infection with COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses, like SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is lacking.
In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 may rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal clotting and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Clotting abnormalities, specifically an increase in prothrombin time, have been described in 6% of those admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while abnormal kidney function is seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people who present with COVID-19 demonstrate elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five being spent hospitalised.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median time of seven days between hospitalisation and death.
In a study of early cases, the median time from exhibiting initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a death rate of 2.8% while women had a death rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung picture resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was noted by elevated levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalised had preexisting conditions.
Availability of medical resources and the socioeconomics of a region may also affect mortality.
Estimates of the mortality from the condition vary because of those regional differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.
The under-counting of mild cases can cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past can mean the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
Concerns have been raised about long-term sequelae of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a drop of 20% to 30% in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans suggested organ damage.
This may also lead to post-intensive care syndrome following recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown if past infection provides effective and long-term immunity in people who recover from the disease.
Immunity is seen as likely, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases in which recovery from COVID-19 have been followed by positive tests for coronavirus at a later date have been reported.
These cases are believed to be worsening of a lingering infection rather than re-infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and have an animal origin, through spillover infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1 December 2019.
Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8 December 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percent of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percent of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not time bound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution.
While not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about how many people have been infected.
In the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600, 80 (1.7%) are already dead.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival festivals, and spread to younger people, causing a relatively lower mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been formally classified as such.
Furthermore, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as assessed from blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the gap between men and women closing only at 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for this sex-difference is not known, but genetic and behavioural factors could be a reason.
Sex-based immunological differences, lesser prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected individuals were men and 72% of those died with COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking sex-related data of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral illnesses like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, particularly nurses, are women, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name had been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at preventing stigmatisation.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO additionally uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both the disease and virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as interim names for the virus and disease in accordance with 2015 guidance against using locations in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently required a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver in the timescale required, a local startup reverse-engineered and printed the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and disinformation emerged regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and rapidly spread online.
Humans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No medications or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines in COVID-19 are underway by government organisations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to assess treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promise of efficacy.
There is no available vaccine, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being utilised because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, be it inactive or dead, aims to elicit a prompt immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a novel technique for creating a vaccination).
Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and efficacy.
On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.
Antibody dependent enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge for vaccine development for SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials were evaluating already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Repurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the Chinese research, with nine phase III trials on remdesivir across several countries due to report by the end of April.
A dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates was in place, as of April 2020.
Several existing antiviral medications are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There is tentative evidence for efficacy by remdesivir, as of March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate-use remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy.
Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese Health Authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that twice that dose is highly dangerous and could be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19.
The Chinese 7th edition guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further in vivo study after demonstrating low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.
Studies have demonstrated that initial spike protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from embracing these therapies without further study.
Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in COVID-19 treatment.
Cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties.
Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by China's National Health Commission after a small study was completed.
It is undergoing a phase 2 non randomised test at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is meant to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies for treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomised, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an efficacious treatment for CRS.
Transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunisation.
This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralisation is the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
Production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from recovered patients and contains antibodies specific to this virus, could be increased for quicker deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Central Hospital of Wuhan, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
And are you having any of the following symptoms with your chest pain
And are you having a runny nose?
And does this pain move from your chest?
And drink lots of fluids
And she is sorta have the same symptoms
And tell me what symptoms are you having now?
And your symptoms do not go away in five days
Any sharp pain on your left side of your chest?
Are you having any difficulty breathing now
Besides the diabetes do you have other problems or important diseases?
But if you have the cough
Cause they're having a cough
Do you have any blood pressure problem as far as you know?
Do your relatives have the same symptoms
Have a dry cough a cold and runny nose vomiting diarrhea
I don't think I have high blood pressure
I feel a pain in the chest here in the front part of the chest
I had a short sharp pain in my chest
I have hay fever though too
I have made on the body around the chest area?
I see it going from the center of your chest going up to your neck
It hurts in the chest
It is occurring right in the middle of my chest
It is right in the center of my chest
It sounds like you just may have the garden variety cold or a flu
I will send you an image
I will send you an image on your screen
Most of the time it is this type of chest pain
My sister has similar symptoms
Now I send you an image
Or if you have high blood pressure
So your chest pain started this morning
The fever started two days ago
The muscle pains with the hay fever
Well from my point of view it is a little flu
Well madam from listening to your symptoms it sounds like you've got one of the flu viruses
You are probably having chest pain
Preliminary Estimates of the Prevalence of Selected Underlying Health Conditions Among Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 — United States, February 12–March 28, 2020
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic.
As of March 28, 2020, a total of 571,678 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 26,494 deaths have been reported worldwide.
Reports from China and Italy suggest that risk factors for severe disease include older age and the presence of at least one of several underlying health conditions.
U.S. older adults, including those aged ≥65 years and particularly those aged ≥85 years, also appear to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19–associated outcomes; however, data describing underlying health conditions among U.S. COVID-19 patients have not yet been reported.
As of March 28, 2020, U.S. states and territories have reported 122,653 U.S. COVID-19 cases to CDC, including 7,162 (5.8%) for whom data on underlying health conditions and other known risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections were reported.
Among these 7,162 cases, 2,692 (37.6%) patients had one or more underlying health condition or risk factor, and 4,470 (62.4%) had none of these conditions reported.
The percentage of COVID-19 patients with at least one underlying health condition or risk factor was higher among those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission (358 of 457, 78%) and those requiring hospitalization without ICU admission (732 of 1,037, 71%) than that among those who were not hospitalized (1,388 of 5,143, 27%).
The most commonly reported conditions were diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, and cardiovascular disease.
These preliminary findings suggest that in the United States, persons with underlying health conditions or other recognized risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections appear to be at a higher risk for severe disease from COVID-19 than are persons without these conditions.
Data from laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to CDC from 50 states, four U.S. territories and affiliated islands, the District of Columbia, and New York City with February 12–March 28, 2020 onset dates were analyzed.
Cases among persons repatriated to the United States from Wuhan, China, and the Diamond Princess cruise ship were excluded.
For cases with missing onset dates, date of onset was estimated by subtracting 4 days (median interval from symptom onset to specimen collection date among cases with known dates in these data) from the earliest specimen collection.
Public health departments reported cases to CDC using a standardized case report form that captures information (yes, no, or unknown) on the following conditions and potential risk factors: chronic lung disease (inclusive of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], and emphysema); diabetes mellitus; cardiovascular disease; chronic renal disease; chronic liver disease; immunocompromised condition; neurologic disorder, neurodevelopmental, or intellectual disability; pregnancy; current smoking status; former smoking status; or other chronic disease.
Data reported to CDC are preliminary and can be updated by health departments over time; critical data elements might be missing at the time of initial report; thus, this analysis is descriptive, and no statistical comparisons could be made.
The percentages of patients of all ages with underlying health conditions who were not hospitalized, hospitalized without ICU admission, and hospitalized with ICU admission were calculated.
Percentages of hospitalizations with and without ICU admission were estimated for persons aged ≥19 years with and without underlying health conditions.
This part of the analysis was limited to persons aged ≥19 years because of the small sample size of cases in children with reported underlying health conditions (N = 32).
To account for missing data among these preliminary reports, ranges were estimated with a lower bound including cases with both known and unknown status for hospitalization with and without ICU admission as the denominator and an upper bound using only cases with known outcome status as the denominator.
Because of small sample size and missing data on underlying health conditions among COVID-19 patients who died, case-fatality rates for persons with and without underlying conditions were not estimated.
As of March 28, 2020, a total of 122,653 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases (Figure) and 2,112 deaths were reported to CDC.
Case report forms were submitted to CDC for 74,439 (60.7%) cases.
Data on presence or absence of underlying health conditions and other recognized risk factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections (i.e., smoking and pregnancy) were available for 7,162 (5.8%) patients (Table 1).
Approximately one third of these patients (2,692, 37.6%), had at least one underlying condition or risk factor.
Diabetes mellitus (784, 10.9%), chronic lung disease (656, 9.2%), and cardiovascular disease (647, 9.0%) were the most frequently reported conditions among all cases.
Among 457 ICU admissions and 1,037 non-ICU hospitalizations, 358 (78%) and 732 (71%), respectively occurred among persons with one or more reported underlying health condition.
In contrast, 1,388 of 5,143 (27%) COVID-19 patients who were not hospitalized were reported to have at least one underlying health condition.
Among patients aged ≥19 years, the percentage of non-ICU hospitalizations was higher among those with underlying health conditions (27.3%–29.8%) than among those without underlying health conditions (7.2%–7.8%); the percentage of cases that resulted in an ICU admission was also higher for those with underlying health conditions (13.3%–14.5%) than those without these conditions (2.2%–2.4%) (Table 2).
Small numbers of COVID-19 patients aged &lt; 19 years were reported to be hospitalized (48) or admitted to an ICU (eight).
In contrast, 335 patients aged &lt; 19 years were not hospitalized and 1,342 had missing data on hospitalization.
Among all COVID-19 patients with complete information on underlying conditions or risk factors, 184 deaths occurred (all among patients aged ≥19 years); 173 deaths (94%) were reported among patients with at least one underlying condition.
Among 122,653 U.S. COVID-19 cases reported to CDC as of March 28, 2020, 7,162 (5.8%) patients had data available pertaining to underlying health conditions or potential risk factors; among these patients, higher percentages of patients with underlying conditions were admitted to the hospital and to an ICU than patients without reported underlying conditions.
These results are consistent with findings from China and Italy, which suggest that patients with underlying health conditions and risk factors, including, but not limited to, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, COPD, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic renal disease, and smoking, might be at higher risk for severe disease or death from COVID-19.
This analysis was limited by small numbers and missing data because of the burden placed on reporting health departments with rapidly rising case counts, and these findings might change as additional data become available.
It is not yet known whether the severity or level of control of underlying health conditions affects the risk for severe disease associated with COVID-19.
Many of these underlying health conditions are common in the United States: based on self-reported 2018 data, the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes among U.S. adults was 10.1%, and the U.S. age-adjusted prevalence of all types of heart disease (excluding hypertension without other heart disease) was 10.6% in 2017.
The age-adjusted prevalence of COPD among U.S. adults is 5.9%, and in 2018, the U.S. estimated prevalence of current asthma among persons of all ages was 7.9%.
CDC continues to develop and update resources for persons with underlying health conditions to reduce the risk of acquiring COVID-19.
The estimated higher prevalence of these conditions among those in this early group of U.S. COVID-19 patients and the potentially higher risk for more severe disease from COVID-19 associated with the presence of underlying conditions highlight the importance of COVID-19 prevention in persons with underlying conditions.
The findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations.
First, these data are preliminary, and the analysis was limited by missing data related to the health department reporting burden associated with rapidly rising case counts and delays in completion of information requiring medical chart review; these findings might change as additional data become available.
Information on underlying conditions was only available for 7,162 (5.8%) of 122,653 cases reported to CDC.
It cannot be assumed that those with missing information are similar to those with data on either hospitalizations or underlying health conditions.
Second, these data are subject to bias in outcome ascertainment because of short follow-up time.
Some outcomes might be underestimated, and long-term outcomes cannot be assessed in this analysis.
Third, because of the limited availability of testing in many jurisdictions during this period, this analysis is likely biased toward more severe cases, and findings might change as testing becomes more widespread.
Fourth, because of the descriptive nature of these data, attack rates among persons with and without underlying health conditions could not be compared, and thus the risk difference of severe disease with COVID-19 between these groups could not be estimated.
Fifth, no conclusions could be drawn about underlying conditions that were not included in the case report form or about different conditions that were reported in a single, umbrella category.
For example, asthma and COPD were included in a chronic lung disease category.
Finally, for some underlying health conditions and risk factors, including neurologic disorders, chronic liver disease, being a current smoker, and pregnancy, few severe outcomes were reported; therefore, conclusions cannot be drawn about the risk for severe COVID-19 among persons in these groups.
Persons in the United States with underlying health conditions appear to be at higher risk for more severe COVID-19, consistent with findings from other countries.
Persons with underlying health conditions who have symptoms of COVID-19, including fever, cough, or shortness of breath, should immediately contact their health care provider.
These persons should take steps to protect themselves from COVID-19, through washing their hands; cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces; and social distancing, including staying at home, avoiding crowds, gatherings, and travel, and avoiding contact with persons who are ill.
Maintaining at least a 30-day supply of medication, a 2-week supply of food and other necessities, and knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms are recommended for those with underlying health conditions.
All persons should take steps to protect themselves from COVID-19 and to protect others.
All persons who are ill should stay home, except to get medical care; should not go to work; and should stay away from others.
This is especially important for those who work with persons with underlying conditions or who otherwise are at high risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19.
Community mitigation strategies, which aim to slow the spread of COVID-19, are important to protect all persons from COVID-19, especially persons with underlying health conditions and other persons at risk for severe COVID-19–associated disease (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf).
What is already known about this topic?
Published reports from China and Italy suggest that risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease include underlying health conditions, but data describing underlying health conditions among U.S. COVID-19 patients have not yet been reported.
What is added by this report?
Based on preliminary U.S. data, persons with underlying health conditions such as diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, and cardiovascular disease, appear to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19–associated disease than persons without these conditions.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Strategies to protect all persons and especially those with underlying health conditions, including social distancing and handwashing, should be implemented by all communities and all persons to help slow the spread of COVID-19.
Emergence of a Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19): Protocol for Extending Surveillance Used by the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre and Public Health England
The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) and Public Health England (PHE) have successfully worked together on the surveillance of influenza and other infectious diseases for over 50 years, including three previous pandemics.
With the emergence of the international outbreak of the coronavirus infection (COVID-19), a UK national approach to containment has been established to test people suspected of exposure to COVID-19.
At the same time and separately, the RCGP RSC’s surveillance has been extended to monitor the temporal and geographical distribution of COVID-19 infection in the community as well as assess the effectiveness of the containment strategy.
The aims of this study are to surveil COVID-19 in both asymptomatic populations and ambulatory cases with respiratory infections, ascertain both the rate and pattern of COVID-19 spread, and assess the effectiveness of the containment policy.
The RCGP RSC, a network of over 500 general practices in England, extract pseudonymized data weekly.
This extended surveillance comprises of five components: (1) Recording in medical records of anyone suspected to have or who has been exposed to COVID-19.
Computerized medical records suppliers have within a week of request created new codes to support this.
(2) Extension of current virological surveillance and testing people with influenza-like illness or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI)—with the caveat that people suspected to have or who have been exposed to COVID-19 should be referred to the national containment pathway and not seen in primary care.
(3) Serology sample collection across all age groups.
This will be an extra blood sample taken from people who are attending their general practice for a scheduled blood test.
The 100 general practices currently undertaking annual influenza virology surveillance will be involved in the extended virological and serological surveillance.
(4) Collecting convalescent serum samples.
We have the opportunity to escalate the data extraction to twice weekly if needed.
Swabs and sera will be analyzed in PHE reference laboratories.
General practice clinical system providers have introduced an emergency new set of clinical codes to support COVID-19 surveillance.
Additionally, practices participating in current virology surveillance are now taking samples for COVID-19 surveillance from low-risk patients presenting with LRTIs.
Within the first 2 weeks of setup of this surveillance, we have identified 3 cases: 1 through the new coding system, the other 2 through the extended virology sampling.
We have rapidly converted the established national RCGP RSC influenza surveillance system into one that can test the effectiveness of the COVID-19 containment policy.
The extended surveillance has already seen the use of new codes with 3 cases reported.
Rapid sharing of this protocol should enable scientific critique and shared learning.
The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) is a network of general practices (GPs) with a nationally representative population that provides pseudonymized data for weekly surveillance of infectious diseases.
The disease surveillance program is commissioned by Public Health England (PHE) and covers 37 infectious diseases, including influenza.
The RCGP RSC and PHE have an established collaboration of over 50 years in influenza and respiratory disease surveillance and are now in their 53rd season of surveillance and analysis.
The RCGP RSC extracts pseudonymized data from a nationally representative sample of over 500 urban and nonurban GPs each week covering a population of over 4 million.
Data from these practices are reported online in a weekly return, which includes monitoring weekly rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) and other communicable and respiratory diseases in England.
We also produce an annual report.
The RCGP RSC data set includes all coded data and all prescribed items including vaccine exposure.
The RCGP RSC conducts virology surveillance each influenza season, with 100 GPs participating in the 2019-2020 season (Figure 1).
These virology sampling practices are also recruited to be nationally representative (Figure 1).
GPs take nasopharyngeal swabs from persons showing acute respiratory illness within 7 days of the onset of symptoms.
Nasopharyngeal swabs are taken from children younger than 5 years showing symptoms of acute bronchitis or bronchiolitis.
Additionally, nasopharyngeal samples are taken from anyone 5 years and older showing acute onset of ILI and respiratory synctial virus.
Swabs are tested at the PHE Respiratory Virus Unit for influenza to monitor positivity rates and circulating strains, as well as for measuring vaccine effectiveness.
The RCGP RSC successfully conducted a pilot collecting serological samples from adults and linking them to a patient’s medical records during the 2018-2019 influenza season.
This pilot was in collaboration with the PHE Seroepidemiology Unit and added to the residual blood samples submitted to PHE by National Health Service (NHS) laboratories.
Serology can provide important information about background population immunity, and sentinel networks can provide a mechanism for systematic data collection and linkage to medical records and health outcomes.
The serology pilot has demonstrated the ability of the network to collect serology samples in adults.
With the COVID-19 outbreak, PHE and RCGP RSC have adapted existing influenza surveillance to monitor the spread of COVID-19 in the community, and this protocol sets out the basis for that collaboration.
The primary national strategy for COVID-19 infection is containment, with patients who are at high risk managed via the telephone help system NHS111 and the PHE health protection teams, but the RCGP RSC surveillance is entirely separate.
The RCGP RSC, by extending its established work, will provide virological and serological surveillance to monitor the temporal and geographical distribution of COVID-19 infection in the community, and assess the effectiveness of the containment strategy.
We would not be working in isolation on this research.
We will share the protocol with UK colleagues and the I-MOVE consortium who have recently obtained EU Horizon 2020 funding from the stream “Advancing knowledge for the clinical and public health response to the novel coronavirus epidemic”.
It is anticipated that great efficiencies in project management will result through this collaboration than that obtained from countries acting alone.
The aim of this study is to identify whether there is undetected community transmission of COVID-19, estimate population susceptibility, and monitor the temporal and geographical distribution of COVID-19 infection in the community.
The objectives of this study are as follows:
To monitor the burden of suspected COVID-19 activity in the community through primary care surveillance and clinical coding of possible COVID-19 cases referred into the containment pathway
To provide virological evidence on the presence and extent of undetected community transmission of COVID-19 and monitor positivity rates among individuals presenting ILI or acute respiratory tract infections to primary care
To estimate baseline susceptibility to COVID-19 in the community and estimate both symptomatic and asymptomatic exposure rates in the population through seroprevalence monitoring
To pilot implementation of a scheme for collection of convalescent sera with antibody profiles among recovered cases of COVID-19 discharged to the community
We intend to capture the following.
Clinical workload related to reports of COVID-19 using the codes created to flag cases, those being assessed and where the infection is located are excluded (Figures 2-​-44)
Foreign countries visited in the last 28 days
Existing codes that may have utility (Tables 1-​-3).3).
Many GPs and primary care teams may not realize that important relevant data can be coded.
There is also the potential during any pandemic to monitor the effectiveness of any transmission control measures.
Reliable coding of letters and test results that will show an infection has become either confirmed or excluded
The methods will follow the approach used in the current influenza surveillance system and recent serology study, and includes five components: (1) primary care clinical surveillance; (2) virological surveillance; (3) population serological surveillance; (4) convalescent sera in cases; and (5) data curation.
The NHS uses the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) system of coding, which is normally only updated twice annually.
There was added complexity as some computerized medical record (CMR) suppliers use the Read coding systems (Read clinical terms version 3 – CTv3), which is no longer updated.
Additionally, there were no clinical codes to record COVID-19 in early February 2020.
Therefore, the two main GP system suppliers added the five terms shown in Table 4 as system-wide local codes.
A UK emergency release of SNOMED CT concepts for COVID-19 was also subsequently made available across all CMR systems (Table 4).
The intention is that these will eventually be mapped to the new SNOMED CT concepts as they become available, allowing recording of relevant data (Multimedia Appendix 1).
The key requirements for this release were the ability to code (Table 4) a case of COVID-19, exposure to risk of infection (travel to an area where there may be a higher risk), contact with anyone infected with COVID-19, a report that a person had been tested for COVID-19, and that the disease had been excluded (likely a negative test).
In addition, practices are now able to code any foreign travel undertaken, including the ability to record visits to multiple countries (implemented February 8, 2020).
Figures 2-​-44 show the EMIS web implementation.
Currently, virology samples for influenza surveillance are accompanied by a standard request form.
For COVID-19, we will create a new request form that will record:
Date of onset of symptoms
Diagnosis of any of the following:
Acute bronchitis/bronchiolitis in those younger than five years
Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI)
History of fever (Y/N); measured (Y/N); if yes, level
Shortness of breath (Y/N), if measured: oxygen saturation and respiratory rate
Recent travel (Y/N); if yes, countries visited in last 14 days
Contact with a named person with confirmed COVID-19 (Y/N) with a free text comment about the level of certainty
These codes will be grouped ontologically into “definite”, “probable”, “possible”, and “not a case” using our standard approach to grouping codes (Table 5), which has been used previously across disease areas.
The RCGP RSC definition for ILI is shown in Multimedia Appendix 2.
Public Presentation of Data Using an Observatory and Dashboards
We will develop an observatory to present data nationally and a dashboard for feedback to practices about their data quality and collection of virology and serology samples.
This is based on coding described in Table 4.
Definite case will be presented on our dashboard as “cases” of COVID-19.
Possible cases will be presented as “Under investigation” (investigating).
“Not a case” will be presented as “Excluded”.
Online data has been established within the initial few weeks in the COVID-19 Observatory (Figure 5), indicating the overall number of patients and rate per 10,000 patients of cases confirmed or under investigation, as well as where the virus is excluded.
We have the option to move to twice weekly surveillance reports with a scope to change this to daily reporting.
We will continue virology sampling from our sentinel practices, rather than discontinuing as seasonal influenza declines.
Additionally, we will recruit more surveillance practices.
The RCGP RSC virology practices will aim to undertake 200-300 nasopharyngeal swabs per week across the RCGP RSC sentinel network, collecting specimens across all age bands.
In addition to the inclusion criteria for influenza virology surveillance (ILI, acute bronchitis/bronchiolitis), participating practices will take nasopharyngeal swab samples from any people showing acute symptoms of LRTI if the onset of symptoms is within 7 days.
RCGP RSC research officers and practice liaison staff will manage practices to achieve a total national sample of 200-300 swabs per week.
This could be increased if PHE modelers require more samples.
Samples from each practice would be spread across the following age groups: &lt; 5 years, 5-17 years, 18-64 years, and 65 years and older
Samples (swabs or serum) collected will be sent via prepaid envelopes addressed to the appropriate PHE laboratory for analysis.
All samples collected will be tested for the presence of influenza and COVID-19.
Additionally, PHE will retrospectively test any influenza virology samples collected between early and mid-February 2020 for COVID-19.
Practices will still follow the PHE protocol for COVID-19 with respect to people at risk of infection who should be signposted down the containment pathway, rather than physically attend their practice.
Direct testing of those who attend surgery remains permitted, but we have also rolled out self-swabbing at home.
Summary of processes are detailed in Multimedia Appendix 3.
Everyone with an ILI or a respiratory illness who contacts a GP (eg, phones for an appointment) should be asked specifically about recent travel to China and other countries flagged in current PHE advice, or if they have had contact with other people with COVID-19.
If these screening enquiries are positive, the patient would be advised to not come to the practice but instead to follow the PHE flow sheet.
This can be by a reception or clinician staff, depending on individual practice protocol.
These calls should be coded into the GP CMR system and can be reported as part of the RCGP RSC weekly return.
We have developed training material to support this coding (Multimedia Appendix 4).
These include prompt cards for:
Practice reception or triage staff: for coding of any patients calling the practice with symptoms of acute respiratory infection with a history of travel to important areas based on PHE advice
Administrative staff or clinicians who code: to encourage consistent coding of results for any suspected cases, including coding of negative results for exclusion
Practices participating in virology surveillance will opportunistically collect blood samples from patients coming into the practice for a routine blood test.
Patients who attend their practice for a routine blood test will be asked to provide an additional sample for serology.
We have conducted initial searches within the RCGP RSC database to look at the number of full blood count (FBC) results and overall rates in adults and children (Figures 6-​-9).9).
An FBC is one of the most common tests performed, and we hope this will give an approximate indication of overall numbers of blood tests performed.
The sampling rate, per 100,000 patients was highest for children 15-17 years of age and 60 year or older in adults, with the lowest rates in children 0-4 years of age and 18-29 years of age in adults (Figures 6-​-99).
We will provide 1000 serology baseline samples across all ages that reflect the varying rates of attendance by age.
Additionally, we will test if we can obtain these all from virology practices to enhance the yield.
A good geographical spread is important, so PHE can advise on areas where serology will most usefully be collected.
This will be followed by 800 samples monthly.
The sample will be stratified with 200 specimens for prepandemic survey (100 for monthly) in the following age groups: &lt; 5 years, 5-17 years, 18-64 years, and 65 years or older.
The younger patients, in many practices younger than 14 years, and in nearly all for children younger than 8 years will require pediatric serology surveillance.
We will develop a new request form for practices to capture recent travel and exposure to COVID-19.
We will pilot a scheme for collecting convalescent serology from people with confirmed cases and who have had an acute virology sample at the time of their infection.
This is to identify a carrier state in patients who have recovered from the virus but may continue shedding the virus.
If there are a small number of cases, this may assist in developing a test kit for patients to take to their own GP and explore its acceptability to patients.
If there are a large number of COVID-19 cases nationally, convalescent samples could be collected from RCGP RSC practices where there are confirmed cases, with the ability to link to the full medical record.
This process may include checking pseudonymized NHS numbers for positive individuals at RCGP RSC practices, checking current PHE guidance regarding considerations of infectiousness for confirmed cases, and offering the patient an appointment following the previously mentioned process.
This needs to be carefully coordinated nationally across the network and may require PHE to ensure individuals are not contacted by multiple agencies.
RCGP RSC could provide a useful structure to channel the initial contact once PHE has made a request.
The RCGP RSC practices participating in the annual influenza virology surveillance have started sampling from patients showing symptoms of a LRTI.
All samples received are being tested for influenza and COVID-19.
The RCGP RSC will explore ways to collect convalescent samples from any patients tested positive for COVID-19 through the extension of the virological surveillance.
From the start, we will be carefully curating data to ensure that it can be used for future studies.
Our clinical data will be linked to virology.
We will curate our data using the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable principles.
To facilitate this our data set is listed with Health Data Research UK and the European Health Data Evidence Network.
The statistical methodology is in support of a policy approach to widespread disease outbreak, where so-called nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are used to respond to an emerging pandemic to produce disease suppression.
This policy aims to reduce contact rates in the population and thereby reduce transmission of the virus.
To implement this the UK government has recently articulated the desire to implement population self-isolation measures.
By targeting the reproduction number (R) (the average number of secondary cases each case generates) and aiming to reduce the R to below 1, the policy seeks to reduce case numbers to low levels or (as seen in previous outbreaks with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Ebola) to eliminate human-to-human transmission.
As the experience from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic has shown, NPIs can be a crucial component of pandemic mitigation.
Key to the focus of our study will be the estimation of peak cases in the population and continual monitoring by data collection and modelling the potential growth and emergence of subsequent peaks in new cases as social distancing measures are relaxed.
There has already been publication of important disease epidemiological measures concerning the outbreak of COVID-19 in mainland China.
A further fundamental measure in pandemic dynamics is the length of time from infection to when a person is infectious to others and the mean duration of infectiousness.
These factors, if estimated accurately, will give good predictions for the likely length of the pandemic, the final number of infected cases.
We intend to apply approximate Bayesian inference (ABC) to (possibly spatially heterogeneous) Susceptible-Exposed- Infectious-Removed (SEIR) stochastic epidemic models.
Such techniques are highly parallelizable and have been successfully applied to many fields including disease transmission modelling.
They are particularly suited to situations where likelihood functions are absent and where more traditional approaches such as Markov chain Monte Carlo are impractical.
Such an approach has been demonstrated to work effectively on the ASPREN surveillance data, a network of sentinel GPs and nurse practitioners who report deidentified information on ILIs and other conditions, where issues such as missing data and the need to model the observation process itself has been successfully addressed.
Furthermore, peaks in new cases have been estimated by distributional methods.
Estimates of the parameters of the SEIR model are tractable on large data sets because of parallelizability, and these methods have been implemented in several R libraries; we intend to use the libraries ABSEIR (deposited on GitHub: https://tinyurl.com/vqu35cj) and abctools (https://tinyurl.com/tfjavz4) to estimate epidemic measures on a weekly basis.
Since we are fitting an SIR-epidemic model in the ABC routine, we anticipate that our results will be robust against weekly case data containing relatively small counts.
For example, see for the ABC methodology applied to the Tristan da Cunha common cold data from 1967, where counts of I (number of infectious cases) and R (number of recovered cases) are in the tens at most.
Finally, in addition to the above methodology we will employ the Kaplan-Meier method with two outcomes (death and recovery) to estimate the case fatality ratio.
This approach is independent of the ABC methodology and will allow comparisons between estimates from the two modelling approaches to judge robustness of results.
RCGP RSC’s surveillance with PHE is defined as Health Protection under Regulation 3 of The Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002.
This has been confirmed by PHE’s Caldicott Guardian’s Office.
We do not see any increased risk to practices or practitioners taking part in this surveillance.
Infection prevention and control advice will follow extant national guidance.
Any cases identified will be managed according to the PHE/NHS guidance in force at the time, including advice for identified contacts.
However, our training will include reminders about safe handling of specimens and revision of infection control measures anticipated to be high in our practices.
It is a key part of Regulation 12 about safe care and treatment, periodically inspected by the Care Quality Commission.
Travel History and Clinical Descriptors of the COVID-19 Infections
The RCGP RSC practices have been advised on the clinical coding that has been made available for COVID-19 across all CMR systems.
This includes information on coding of clinical descriptors (Table 4) and any recent travel history.
Establishment of Extended Virology Sampling
The RCGP RSC practices participating in the annual influenza virology surveillance have started sampling from patients showing symptoms of LRTI.
All samples received are being tested for influenza and COVID-19.
This has led to initial early identification of background spread in low-risk patients.
As of March 7, 2020, the surveillance system has detected 2 cases of COVID-19 in low-risk patients with no history of travel through extended virological sampling.
This protocol describes how we have adapted a national influenza surveillance system to monitor community spread of an unexpected infection of COVID-19.
We have rapidly created and incorporated new codes to allow data recording, and are collecting data to monitor the effectiveness of containment strategies.
Through this surveillance, we intend to find out more about the epidemiology of COVID-19 in ambulatory care.
In particular, its rate of spread, both temporal and geographical.
Our testing of low-risk patients will also inform whether the containment strategy that is based on virology testing of high-risk patients and their contacts plus self-isolation is effective.
Containment should slow the spread, and there may be benefits in the management of spread from intense surveillance.
However, there may come a point at which the virus spreads more widely into the population, as has happened in Italy.
Surveillance of low-risk patients should inform when we reach this tipping point and when infection rates start to remit.
The epidemiology of COVID-19 remains emergent.
The registration-based nature of UK primary care means that we will be able to create a complete picture of the cumulative incidence and duration.
The surveillance system should be able to identify areas where COVID-19 spread is taking place that might be suitable for trials of antiviral therapy.
We could also follow up on the effectiveness or any adverse reactions to these medicines or vaccinations.
Finally, early detection of a confirmed COVID-19 case has exemplified the rapid implementation of this enhanced surveillance in the national network.
Safety of practices is our primary concern.
The RCGP RSC has operated for over 50 years and has been involved in collecting samples to monitor disease and vaccine effectiveness through the Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968/69, the Russian flu of 1977/78, and the 2009 Swine flu pandemic.
We are not aware of any increased risk to practice staff or other patients from involvement in surveillance.
Pandemic preparedness is part of the role of the RCGP RSC.
It is plausible that enhanced coding of information from contacts with the practices in RCGP RSC will reduce the likelihood of people who may be suspected COVID-19 cases being brought to the surgery inadvertently.
Where cases are detected unexpectedly, it is probably helpful for that patient, their contacts, and the practice to know.
The impact on practices has been to close for a day, if a case is found, for deep cleaning and then reopen.
The principal limitations of our system are the number of data points.
We are collecting serology and virology data from 100 sites, which covers a small group of the population.
This has been satisfactory for monitoring influenza, but we are not certain if this is a sufficiently large sample for the COVID-19 outbreak.
Our sites (surveillance practices) are currently fixed, and it could be helpful to be able to rapidly onboard practices in regions where there are more cases.
Currently, we will be reporting weekly.
Our existing system can be enhanced to twice weekly, but maybe daily or hourly data should be our current approach.
Opportunistic sampling for serology in children younger than 10 years might be limited due to the overall reduced rate of blood tests in children.
The extended surveillance using the RCGP RSC-PHE network for the emergent COVID-19 outbreak has been established rapidly.
The model of getting the appropriate informatics to enable capture of the required data has already been a success, with data recording starting the week the codes were created.
In addition, modifying the existing surveillance system to collect population data in a parallel way has also been effective.
However, we are at present unsure as to whether the scale of this surveillance provides sufficient data to drive local containment strategies or if reporting infrequently meets the need of our information age.
National Basketball Association suspends season due to COVID-19 concerns
On Wednesday, the United States' National Basketball Association (NBA) suspended its professional basketball season due to concerns regarding COVID-19.
The NBA's decision followed a Utah Jazz player testing positive for the COVID-19 virus.
The NBA did not release the identity of the player in question in its announcement.
They did say he was not present at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City, where the Utah Jazz were to play against the Oklahoma City Thunder.
According to its press release, the NBA was "suspending game play following the conclusion of [Wednesday's] schedule of games until further notice."
The Jazz's game was cancelled, as was another NBA game Wednesday between the Sacramento Kings and the New Orleans Pelicans.
Other games scheduled for Wednesday were still held, according to NBC News.
The United States' other major basketball organization, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which runs college basketball, has cancelled its own tournament, March Madness, for both men's and women's leagues.
According to Johns Hopkins University, as of Wednesday, there were at least 1,279 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States.
CNBC reported there were at least 118,381 cases worldwide.
US President Trump declares COVID-19 national emergency
On Friday, United States President Donald Trump declared a national emergency in response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.
The move came two days after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak, which causes the COVID-19 disease, to be a pandemic.
The move gives the federal government access to around US$50 billion in extra funding to combat the pandemic, according to NBC News.
The proclamation specifically said "the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States constitutes a national emergency" and said the national emergency began on March 1, almost two weeks before the proclamation itself.
The United States Department of Health and Human Services declared the outbreak a "public health emergency" on January 31.
Trump did not place the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in charge of the government's response to COVID-19, which Politico reported left some experts in disaster management disappointed.
Politico quoted Tim Manning, formerly a deputy administrator at FEMA, as saying "FEMA has an important role in coordinating the larger response to the crisis" and "[i]f there's an emergency, FEMA needs to be involved."
Trump made the decision under provisions of the National Emergencies Act, amongst other governing authorities.
The Trump administration also announced other efforts in response to COVID-19, including waiving the interest it collects on federal student loans and increasing U.S. strategic oil reserve oil purchases.
Impact of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic on education
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic has affected educational systems worldwide, leading to the widespread closures of schools and universities.
As of 8 April 2020, approximately 1.716 billion learners have been affected due to school closures in response to COVID-19.
According to UNESCO monitoring, 188 countries have implemented nationwide closures and 5 have implemented local closures, impacting about 99.4% of the world's student population.
On 23 March 2020, Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) released a statement announcing the cancellation of Cambridge IGCSE, Cambridge O Level, Cambridge International AS &amp; A Level, Cambridge AICE Diploma, and Cambridge Pre-U examinations for the May/June 2020 series across all countries.
International Baccalaureate exams have also been cancelled.School closures impact not only students, teachers, and families, but have far-reaching economic and societal consequences.
School closures in response to COVID-19 have shed light on various social and economic issues, including student debt, digital learning, food insecurity, and homelessness, as well as access to childcare, health care, housing, internet, and disability services.
The impact was more severe for disadvantaged children and their families, causing interrupted learning, compromised nutrition, childcare problems, and consequent economic cost to families who could not work.In response to school closures, UNESCO recommended the use of distance learning programmes and open educational applications and platforms that schools and teachers can use to reach learners remotely and limit the disruption of education.
Efforts to stem the spread of COVID-19 through non-pharmaceutical interventions and preventive measures such as social-distancing and self-isolation have prompted the widespread closure of primary, secondary, and tertiary schooling in over 100 countries.Previous outbreaks of infectious diseases have prompted widespread school closings around the world, with varying levels of effectiveness.
Mathematical modelling has shown that transmission of an outbreak may be delayed by closing schools.
However, effectiveness depends on the contacts children maintain outside of school.
School closures may be effective when enacted promptly.
If school closures occur late relative to an outbreak, they are less effective and may not have any impact at all.
Additionally, in some cases, the reopening of schools after a period of closure has resulted in increased infection rates.
As closures tend to occur concurrently with other interventions such as public gathering bans, it can be difficult to measure the specific impact of school closures.During the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic in the United States, school closures and public gathering bans were associated with lower total mortality rates.
Cities that implemented such interventions earlier had greater delays in reaching peak mortality rates.
Schools closed for a median duration of 4 weeks according to a study of 43 US cities' response to the Spanish Flu.
School closures were shown to reduce morbidity from the Asian flu by 90% during the 1957–58 outbreak, and up to 50% in controlling influenza in the US, 2004–2008.Multiple countries successfully slowed the spread of infection through school closures during the 2009 H1N1 Flu pandemic.
School closures in the city of Oita, Japan, were found to have successfully decreased the number of infected students at the peak of infection; however closing schools was not found to have significantly decreased the total number of infected students.
Mandatory school closures and other social distancing measures were associated with a 29% to 37% reduction in influenza transmission rates.
Early school closures in the United States delayed the peak of the 2009 H1N1 Flu pandemic.
Despite the overall success of closing schools, a study of school closures in Michigan found that "district level reactive school closures were ineffective."During the swine flu outbreak in 2009 in the UK, in an article titled "Closure of schools during an influenza pandemic" published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases, a group of epidemiologists endorsed the closure of schools in order to interrupt the course of the infection, slow further spread and buy time to research and produce a vaccine.
Having studied previous influenza pandemics including the 1918 flu pandemic, the influenza pandemic of 1957 and the 1968 flu pandemic, they reported on the economic and workforce effect school closure would have, particularly with a large percentage of doctors and nurses being women, of whom half had children under the age of 16.
They also looked at the dynamics of the spread of influenza in France during French school holidays and noted that cases of flu dropped when schools closed and re-emerged when they re-opened.
They noted that when teachers in Israel went on strike during the flu season of 1999–2000, visits to doctors and the number of respiratory infections dropped by more than a fifth and more than two fifths respectively.
For schools and childcare facilities, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person has been in a school building regardless of community spread.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as cancelling field trips, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or meals in a cafeteria, increasing the space between desks, staggering arrival and dismissal times, limiting nonessential visitors, and using a separate health office location for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is substantial transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school dismissals may be considered.
On 26 January, China instituted measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak which included extending the Spring Festival holiday to contain the outbreak.
Universities and schools around the country closed.
On 23 February, Iran's Ministry of Health announced the closure of universities, higher educational institutions and schools in several cities and provinces.
On 3 March, UNESCO released the first global numbers on school closures and affected students.
It reported that 13 countries had enacted preventive measures including the temporary closure of schools and universities, impacting 290.5 million students around the world.
In reaction, UNESCO called on countries to support affected students and families and facilitate large-scale inclusive distance learning programmes.
On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the full closure of all schools and universities nationwide as Italy reached 100 deaths.
In doing so, Italy became one of 22 countries on three continents which had announced or implemented school closures.
On 5 March, the majority of learners affected by COVID-19 emergency measures were located in China, with 233 million learners affected, followed by Japan at 16.5 million and Iran at 14.5 million.
By 10 March, one in five students worldwide was "staying away from school due to the COVID-19 crisis" while another one in four was barred from higher education institutions.
On 13 March, governments in 49 countries announced or implemented school closures, including 39 countries which closed schools nationwide and 22 countries with localised school closures.
By 16 March, this figure increased from 49 to 73 countries according to UNESCO.
By 19 March, 50% of students worldwide were affected by school closures, corresponding to nationwide closures in 102 countries and local closures in 11 countries affecting 850 million children and youth.
By 20 March, over 70% of the world's learners were impacted by closures, with 124 country-wide school closures.
On 23 March, all Nigerian school were found to have been closed down by Nigerian government, markets as well as companies were closed down and children were forbidden by parents to step out of their homes.
On 26 March, all New Zealand schools and universities have been closed down across the country.
The government has imposed a two-week holiday, allowing schools to transition to forms of distant teaching as soon as possible.
Universities have closed for one week, but resumed with online teaching afterwards.
Other school services remain open, but teaching is restricted to distant learning.
By 27 March, nearly 90 percent of the world's student population was out of class.
Regions with schools remaining open included Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, Sweden, and some U.S. states.
By 29 March, more than 1.5 billion children and other students were affected by nationwide school closures.
Others were disrupted by localized closures.
Until April 6, holidays were extended in all secondary schools of Turkmenistan.
An order signed by the Ministry of Education as a preventative measure aims to prevent the spread of respiratory diseases in connection with the WHO coronavirus pandemic.
10 countries have localised schools closures, UNESCO estimates 473,933,356 learners are potentially at risk (pre-primary to upper-secondary education) and 77,938,904 learners are potentially at risk in tertiary education.
Note: Figures correspond to total number of learners enrolled at pre-primary, primary, lower-secondary, and upper-secondary levels of education [ISCED levels 0 to 3], as well as at tertiary education levels [ISCED levels 5 to 8] who could be affected should localised closures become countrywide.
Enrolment figures based on latest UNESCO Institute of Statistics data.
School closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have shed a light on numerous issues affecting access to education, as well as broader socio-economic issues.
As of March 12, more than 370 million children and youth are not attending school because of temporary or indefinite country wide school closures mandated by governments in an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19.
As of 29 March, nearly 90% of the world's learners were impacted by closures.Even when school closures are temporary, it carries high social and economic costs.
The disruptions they cause affect people across communities, but their impact is more severe for disadvantaged children and their families including interrupted learning, compromised nutrition, childcare problems and consequent economic cost to families who cannot work.
Working parents are more likely to miss work when schools close in order to take care of their children, incurring wage loss in many instances and negatively impacting productivity.
Localised school closures place burdens on schools as parents and officials redirect children to schools that are open.
Women often represent a large share of health-care workers and often cannot attend work because of childcare obligations that result from school closures.
This means that many medical professionals are not at the facilities where they are most needed during a health crisis.
Lack of access to technology or fast, reliable internet access can prevent students in rural areas and from disadvantaged families.
Lack of access to technology or good internet connectivity is an obstacle to continued learning, especially for students from disadvantaged families.
In response to school closures caused by COVID-19, UNESCO recommends the use of distance learning programmes and open educational applications and platforms that schools and teachers can use to reach learners remotely and limit the disruption of education.To aid in slowing the transmission of COVID-19, hundreds of libraries have temporarily closed.
In the United States, numerous major cities announced public library closures, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and New York City, affecting 221 libraries.
For students without internet at home, this increases the difficulty of keeping up with distance learning.
School closures puts a strain on parents and guardians to provide childcare and manage distance learning while children are out of school.
In the absence of alternative options, working parents often leave children alone when schools close and this can lead to risky behaviours, including increased influence of peer pressure and substance abuse.
Many children worldwide rely on free or discounted meals at schools.
When schools close, nutrition is compromised.Nutrition plays a critical role in cognitive development and academic performance for children.In Washington State, around 45% of the states 1.1 million students enrolled in traditional public and charter schools qualify for subsidised school meals.
At least 520,000 students and their families may be affected by food insecurity as a result of school closures.School lunch programmes are the second-biggest anti-hunger initiative in the United States after food stamps.
Every year, nearly 30 million children rely on schools to provide free or low-cost meals including breakfast, lunch, snacks, and even dinner.In Alabama, where state-wide school closures as of 18 March have affected over 720,000 students, the state Superintendent announced that staff in schools disproportionately affected by poverty would create meal distribution networks to provide food for students who rely on school lunches.
School closures negatively impact student learning outcomes.
Schooling provides essential learning and when schools close, children and youth are deprived opportunities for growth and development.
The disadvantages are disproportionate for under-privileged learners who tend to have fewer educational opportunities beyond school.Student drop-out rates tend to increase as an effect of school closures due to the challenge of ensuring all students return to school once school closures ends.
This is especially true of protracted closures.Schools are hubs of social activity and human interaction.
When schools are closed, many children and youth miss out of on social contact that is essential to learning and development.When schools close parents are often asked to facilitate the learning of children at home and can struggle to perform this task.
This is especially true for parents with limited education and resources.
Potential impacts of school closures and reliance on distance learning are not addressed in federal acts of legislation at this time.
Formal education — as opposed to informal education or non-formal education — tends to refer to schools, colleges, universities and training institutions.
A 1974 report by the World Bank defined formal education as the following:Formal education: the hierarchically structured, chronologically graded ‘education system’, running from primary school through the university and including, in addition to general academic studies, a variety of specialised programmes and institutions for full-time technical and professional training.The majority of data collected on the number of students and learners impacted by COVID-19 has been calculated based on the closure of formal education systems.
The UNESCO Institute for Statistics provides figures on students impacted by COVID-19 corresponding to the number of learners enrolled at pre-primary, primary, lower-secondary, and upper-secondary levels of education [ISCED levels 0 to 3], as well as at tertiary education levels [ISCED levels 5 to 8].
Early childhood educational programmes are usually designed for children below the age of 3 and may refer to preschools, nursery schools, kindergartens, and some day care programmes.
While many primary and secondary schools have closed around the world due to COVID-19, measures impacting early childhood educational programmes have varied.
In some countries and territories, preschools and day cares are considered necessary services and have not closed in tandem with broader school closure measures.In the United States, the Washington State Department of Children, Youth, and Families encouraged child care and early learning centres to stay open.
Some school districts may offer alternative child care options, prioritising the children of first responders and healthcare workers.
The governor of Maryland mandated that specific child care services remain open for the children of emergency personnel while Washington State and California have left it to the discretion of care providers.
California Governor Gavin Newsom explained his state's position, saying “We need our child care facilities, our daycare centers, to operate to absorb the impact of these school closures.”
Colorado has encouraged the development of "tool kits" for parents to use at home to emulate the lessons children would have received in their early learning programmes.In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe closed all schools throughout the country until April 8, however, children's daycare facilities were excluded.
In early March, five adults associated with a nursing facility for preschool children in Kobe tested positive for coronavirus.
After testing over one hundred children at the facility, a preschool student was found to be carrying the virus.
Primary or elementary education typically consists of the first four to seven years of formal education.
The International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) canceled the examinations for its Diploma Programme and Career-related Programme candidates scheduled between 30 April and 22 May 2020, reportedly affecting more than 200,000 students worldwide.
The IBO stated that it would award candidates their diplomas or certificates based on "their coursework" and "the established assessment expertise, rigor, and quality control already built into the programme."
Tertiary education, also known as higher education, refers to the non-compulsory educational levels that follow completion of secondary school or high school.
Tertiary education is normally taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, as well as vocational education and training.
Individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive certificates, diplomas, or academic degrees.
Undergraduate education is education conducted after secondary education and prior to post-graduate education, for which the learner is typically awarded a bachelor's degree.
Students enrolled in higher education programmes at colleges, universities, and community colleges are often refereed to in countries such as United States as "college students."The closure of colleges and universities has widespread implications for students, faculty, administrators, and the institutions themselves.
Colleges and universities across the United States have been called upon to issue refunds to students for the cost of tuition and room and board.
In the United States of America, Colleges and universities operate as "mini-cities" which generate significant revenue for cities, states, and regions.
For example, Princeton University contributed $1.58 billion USD to the New Jersey economy and students spent about $60 million in off-campus spending.
College and university closures have a domino effect on economies with far-reaching implications.According to Linda Bilmes of the Harvard Kennedy School, "local hotels, restaurants, cafes, shops, car rental agencies and other local businesses obtain a significant share of annual revenue from graduation week and college reunions...
These communities will suffer a lot of economic damage if the colleges remain closed at that time."Small towns which rely on college students to support the local economy and provide labour to local businesses are especially impacted by school closures and the exodus of students from campus.
In Ithaca, New York, Cornell University students spent at least $4 million a week in Tompkins county.
In the wake of Cornell's decision to keep students home following spring break and transition to virtual instruction, the Mayor of Ithaca called for "immediate and forceful federal action — we will see a horrific economic impact as a result of Cornell University closing."
UNESCO is sharing 10 recommendations during this period:
Examine the readiness and choose the most relevant tools: Decide on the use high-technology and low-technology solutions based on the reliability of local power supplies, internet connectivity, and digital skills of teachers and students.
This could range through integrated digital learning platforms, video lessons, MOOCs, to broadcasting through radios and TVs.
Ensure inclusion of the distance learning programmes: Implement measures to ensure that students including those with disabilities or from low-income backgrounds have access to distance learning programmes, if only a limited number of them have access to digital devices.
Consider temporarily decentralising such devices from computer labs to families and support them with internet connectivity.
Protect data privacy and data security: Assess data security when uploading data or educational resources to web spaces, as well as when sharing them with other organisations or individuals.
Ensure that the use of applications and platforms does not violate students’ data privacy.
Prioritize solutions to address psychosocial challenges before teaching: Mobilize available tools to connect schools, parents, teachers, and students with each other.
Create communities to ensure regular human interactions, enable social caring measures, and address possible psychosocial challenges that students may face when they are isolated.
Plan the study schedule of the distance learning programmes: Organise discussions with stakeholders to examine the possible duration of school closures and decide whether the distance learning programme should focus on teaching new knowledge or enhance students’ knowledge of prior lessons.
Plan the schedule depending on the situation of the affected zones, level of studies, needs of students needs, and availability of parents.
Choose the appropriate learning methodologies based on the status of school closures and home-based quarantines.
Avoid learning methodologies that require face-to-face communication.
Provide support to teachers and parents on the use of digital tools: Organise brief training or orientation sessions for teachers and parents as well, if monitoring and facilitation are needed.
Help teachers to prepare the basic settings such as solutions to the use of internet data if they are required to provide live streaming of lessons.
Blend appropriate approaches and limit the number of applications and platforms: Blend tools or media that are available for most students, both for synchronous communication and lessons, and for asynchronous learning.
Avoid overloading students and parents by asking them to download and test too many applications or platforms.
Develop distance learning rules and monitor students’ learning process: Define the rules with parents and students on distance learning.
Design formative questions, tests, or exercises to monitor closely students’ learning process.
Try to use tools to support submission of students’ feedback and avoid overloading parents by requesting them to scan and send students’ feedback
Define the duration of distance learning units based on students’ self-regulation skills: Keep a coherent timing according to the level of the students’ self-regulation and metacognitive abilities especially for livestreaming classes.
Preferably, the unit for primary school students should not be more than 20 minutes, and no longer than 40 minutes for secondary school students.
Create communities and enhance connection: Create communities of teachers, parents, and school managers to address sense of loneliness or helplessness, facilitate sharing of experience and discussion on coping strategies when facing learning difficulties.
290 million students out of school due to COVID-19: UNESCO releases first global numbers and mobilizes response, UNESCO.
WHEREAS on March 4, 2020, I proclaimed a State of Emergency to exist in California as a result of the threat of COVID-19;
And WHEREAS in a short period of time, COVID-19 has rapidly spread throughout California, necessitating updated and more stringent guidance from federal, state, and local public health officials;
And WHEREAS for the preservation of public health and safety throughout the entire State of California, I find it necessary for all Californians to heed the State public health directives from the Department of Public Health.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GAVIN NEWSOM, Governor of the State of California, in accordance with the authority vested in me by the State Constitution and statutes of the State of California, and in particular, Government Code sections 8567, 8627, and 8665 do hereby issue the following Order to become effective immediately:
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:
1) To preserve the public health and safety, and to ensure the healthcare delivery system is capable of serving all, and prioritizing those at the highest risk and vulnerability, all residents are directed to immediately heed the current State public health directives, which I ordered the Department of Public Health to develop for the current statewide status of COVID-19.
Those directives are consistent with the March 19, 2020, Memorandum on Identification of Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers During COVID-19 Response, found at: https://covid19.ca.gov/.
ORDER OF THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER
To protect public health, I as State Public Health Officer and Director of the California Department of Public Health order all individuals living in the State of California to stay home or at their place of residence except as needed to maintain continuity of operations of the federal critical infrastructure sectors, as outlined at https://www.cisa.gov/critical-infrastructure-sectors.
In addition, and in consultation with the Director of the Governor's Office of Emergency Services, I may designate additional sectors as critical in order to protect the health and well-being of all Californians.
Pursuant to the authority under the Health and Safety Code 120125, 120140, 131080, 120130(c), 120135, 120145, 120175 and 120150, this order is to go into effect immediately and shall stay in effect until further notice.
The federal government has identified 16 critical infrastructure sectors whose assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, are considered so vital to the United States that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, economic security, public health or safety, or any combination thereof.
I order that Californians working in these 16 critical infrastructure sectors may continue their work because of the importance of these sectors to Californians' health and well-being.
This Order is being issued to protect the public health of Californians.
The California Department of Public Health looks to establish consistency across the state in order to ensure that we mitigate the impact of COVID-19.
Our goal is simple, we want to bend the curve, and disrupt the spread of the virus.
The supply chain must continue, and Californians must have access to such necessities as food, prescriptions, and health care.
When people need to leave their homes or places of residence, whether to obtain or perform the functions above, or to otherwise facilitate authorized necessary activities, they should at all times practice social distancing.
2) The healthcare delivery system shall prioritize services to serving those who are the sickest and shall prioritize resources, including personal protective equipment, for the providers providing direct care to them.
3) The Office of Emergency Services is directed to take necessary steps to ensure compliance with this Order.
4) This Order shall be enforceable pursuant to California law, including, but not limited to, Government Code section 8665.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that as soon as hereafter possible, this Order be filed in the Office of the Secretary of State and that widespread publicity and notice be given of this Order.
This Order is not intended to, and does not, create any rights or benefits, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, against the State of California, its agencies, departments, entities, officers, employees, or any other person.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Great Seal of the State of California to be affixed this 19th day of March 2020.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the cause of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), a contagious respiratory disease that was first identified in December 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
The disease is a type of coronavirus, the same family that includes SARS, MERS, and some varieties of the common cold.
It was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020.
While much about COVID-19 is still unknown, preliminary data suggests that it is more virulent and contagious than the seasonal flu, and less virulent but more contagious than SARS and MERS.
Older people and those with underlying conditions are the most at risk of serious complications including death.
Due to the spread of the disease, you are advised not to travel unless necessary, to avoid being infected, quarantined, or stranded by changing restrictions and cancelled flights.
Avoid crowded places whenever possible.
This is not just to protect you, but also those you come in contact with.
As it happens, you probably aren't missing much by staying home, as many attractions around the world are closing their doors to avoid spreading the disease.
If you do need to travel, take precautions as you would for other infections: wash your hands frequently, avoid touching your face, cough and sneeze into your elbow or a tissue, and avoid contact with sick people.
Before traveling, read up on the extensive and fast-changing array of travel restrictions that have been imposed around the world.
After travel, monitor your health and consider self-isolation for two weeks to avoid transmitting the disease to others.
Transportation from long-distance passenger flights to local buses has been curtailed or completely shut down in many countries due to low demand or government orders.
Many international and regional borders are closed.
If you are away from home, and especially if you are in another country, consider returning home as soon as possible; this may get even more difficult as restrictions continue to change.
In some cases it may simply not be possible, even if you're healthy and meet the legal requirements for entry.
If you can't find a way back to your country, contact your nearest embassy or consulate for assistance.
They may be able to organize an evacuation, identify non-regularly scheduled flights, or give you an emergency loan to pay for transport.
In case they can't, make preparations in case you need to stay where you are for an extended period.
If you do find a way back home, be prepared that it may be expensive, inconvenient, and have unusual restrictions (such as no checked baggage).
As of early April 2020, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is approaching one million.
Though the disease started in mainland China, it has spread around the world and China has fewer confirmed cases and deaths than several other countries.
Europe is the new epicenter of the pandemic.
All but a handful of countries have reported at least one case, with the highest numbers of reported cases in the United States, Spain, Italy, Germany, France, mainland China, Iran, and the United Kingdom.
Local transmission is established in many countries in all major inhabited regions of the world except some Pacific island nations.
(See updates from the WHO.)
The full extent of the spread is uncertain, due in part to limited testing.
Many countries are experiencing a severe shortage of test kits, and the authorities have not been able to test everybody who is at high risk, so the real number of cases is probably much higher than the official one.
Countries also differ in their testing and reporting practices, so comparisons of the number of reported cases do not tell the full story of how the epidemic has progressed in different areas.
The virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets and through objects.
The coronavirus is a relatively large virus, meaning it is not truly airborne: it will settle down in respiratory droplets.
Staying two metres (six feet) away from other people is usually enough to prevent transmission through this route.
Transmission from objects can happen, for example, if someone sneezes, touches a doorknob, and then other people touch the doorknob and then touch their faces.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus may last on cardboard for up to 24 hours and on plastic for up to 3 days.
Transmission via the fecal–oral route may also be possible.
Evidence suggests that COVID-19 is contagious even without symptoms, though to what extent is still being investigated.
Common symptoms include a fever, dry cough, and fatigue.
Other less common symptoms include shortness of breath, a sore throat, headache, muscle pain, or sputum production.
Some patients have very mild symptoms, similar to a cold.
Serious complications include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multi-organ failure leading to disability or death.
About 80% of infections result in mild symptoms, while the remaining may result in hospitalization.
Case fatality rate is estimated at 1-3% of infected individuals, most of whom are elderly with underlying health conditions.
The fatality rate is much higher for those over 70 but significantly lower for those under 40.
Those most at risk of COVID-19 infection and serious complications are the elderly and those with weakened immune systems or underlying health conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer.
Not many cases are reported in children and most of these are mild or moderate, though a significant fraction do get pneumonia.
Occupationally, health care workers have higher risk compared to others with clusters of disease among workers and in health care settings.
The time between being exposed to the virus and the emergence of symptoms (incubation period) is typically between 2 and 14 days, though there has been one reported case in China where symptoms appeared 27 days after exposure.
As of February 2020, the period of infectiousness is unknown, but is likely most significant when people are symptomatic.
There is evidence of transmission from people who don't have symptoms, although to what extent is still being investigated.
It is unclear whether it is possible to be reinfected with the virus after recovering from it the first time around.
Long-term effects for people who have recovered remain unclear, but there is evidence of reduced lung capacity in some recovered patients.
Testing for the virus usually consists of a swab inserted through the nose or a throat swab which is analysed in a laboratory for the virus.
The current "gold standard" test involves extracting the genetic material from the sample and analysing it for known genetic markers of the virus.
There is no established test assessing for the virus or antibodies in the blood, although tests are being developed.
There is no test to establish immunity to the virus.
Many governments around the world have advised their citizens not to travel unnecessarily amid the pandemic.
Lots of airlines and package holidays are making it easy for you by waiving cancellation and change fees.
Particularly avoid cruise ship travel.
Older travelers and those with underlying health conditions are most at risk and should avoid travel that puts them at risk, such as long plane flights, visits to crowded places, and especially cruises, even outside of severely affected areas.
In affected areas, most experts recommend a practice known as social distancing.
This means minimising contact with others by keeping a distance of six feet or two meters from them and avoiding gathering together in groups.
Some areas permit small groups; others prohibit all group gatherings.
Measures you are encouraged to take include working from home whenever possible, avoiding crowds and avoiding leaving your home unless absolutely necessary.
If you must go out, try to stay at least 2 meters (6 feet) away from other people.
In many places these measures are required.
Follow hygiene practices like for flu prevention.
Frequently wash your hands with soap and warm water, and then dry your hands on a clean towel.
As coronaviruses are enveloped viruses, washing your hands with soap kills the virus by disrupting the mostly fat-based viral envelope.
Effective hand washing requires rubbing your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Drying your washed hands physically removes some germs from your skin (so don't skip that step, and don't share towels).
If soap and water are not available, then use a &gt;60% alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Alcohol is a quick germ-killer, but it's not quite instant, so this still requires the same 20 seconds of rubbing your hands together, making sure that every single scrap of skin gets wet, and then you have to wait about another minute, for the alcohol to completely dry.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with your hands.
Most people touch their faces every few minutes, all day long.
Try to do this less, and try to wash your hands before touching your face.
Also, try to avoid touching surfaces you don't have to touch in the first place, at least with your bare hands.
Cough and sneeze into your elbow or a tissue, and then immediately throw away the tissue and wash your hands.
Don't stand or sit near people who might be sick.
Stay at least one meter – and ideally two meters (six feet) – away.
As a quick way to eyeball this distance, imagine that you and the other person both reached your hands towards each other.
Could you touch the other person's hand without taking a step towards that person?
If the answer is yes, then you're too close.
Clean objects and surfaces that a lot of people touch, such as doorknobs, phones, and television remotes with regular household cleaner.
Disinfect the surfaces with a suitable disinfectant, such as diluted household bleach.
Stay home when you are sick, and avoid contact with other people until your symptoms are gone.
Do not share personal items that come into contact with saliva, such as toothbrushes, eating utensils, drinks, water bottles, and towels.
The practice of serving yourself from a common plate with your own chopsticks, common in China, should be avoided.
Greet people without touching them.
Avoid hugs, kisses, handshakes, fist bumps, and any other contact.
If it's impossible to avoid contact, then wash your hands both before and after.
It won't protect you from the coronavirus, but it will partially protect you from the flu, which remains a greater risk than COVID-19 in many areas.
This also saves you from unnecessary worry if you get the flu and think it might be the coronavirus.
If you are elderly or otherwise in a high-risk group and can be vaccinated for pneumonia, get that vaccination.
It won't protect you from viral pneumonia from COVID-19, but some COVID-19 patients have died of bacterial pneumonia that attacked their weakened lungs, so a pneumonia vaccination could save your life.
Wearing masks is recommended for those who are suspected of carrying of disease and those who are in close contact with those infected.
For those who are asymptomatic, the WHO does not recommend masks, though some national governments do.
Wearing a mask of some kind is required in some countries and cities in an effort to reduce community transmission.
There are worldwide shortages of surgical masks.
If you do wear a mask, make sure to use it correctly.
The mask should cover your nose and mouth and fit without gaps.
Wash your hands before putting on the mask and avoid touching the mask while wearing it.
If you do touch it, wash your hands immediately afterwards.
When the mask becomes damp, discard and replace it.
Remove it from the back, throw it away, and then wash your hands.
Remember that masks are not a substitute for good hygiene: continue to wash your hands frequently.
Don't stock up on masks if you don't need them.
Mask shortages mean that healthcare workers are having trouble getting a hold of masks, which puts everyone at risk.
That includes N95 respirators, which are not recommended for the general public – these are specialist equipment which must be fitted to be optimally effective.
Leave them for healthcare workers.
Avoid crowded areas, especially enclosed areas without much air circulation, such as conferences, performances, shopping malls, public transportation, and religious services.
Events which involve a large scale gathering of people, from religious pilgrimages to music concerts, are being canceled worldwide, in an effort to contain the spread of the virus.
Tourist attractions, businesses, and transportation may be closed, especially in affected countries.
Some canceled events, especially performances, sporting events, and classes, are being moved online, which means you can experience them without traveling.
At petrol/gas stations, use gloves or wipe down the handle with a disinfectant wipe if you can.
After filling up, clean your hands with hand sanitizer.
The U.S. and Canadian governments recommend avoiding travel by cruise ship.
Infections spread easily on board, and medical care is limited.
Amid a cruise ship outbreak, quarantines and docking are challenging partly due to the large number of people aboard.
Even cruise ships without confirmed cases have been denied permission to dock due to virus fears, and in the high-profile case of the Diamond Princess in Japan, hundreds of people were infected on the ship.
If you believe you may be infected, call a hospital or local emergency medical services instead of going in person to avoid infecting others.
Mention your symptoms and travel history.
Wear a medical mask and follow the instructions of authorities and doctors.
See also: Flight and health
On a plane, follow the same hygiene practices as anywhere else: wash hands frequently, or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if it's not convenient to leave your seat, and avoid touching your face.
Researchers have found that passengers in window seats have less risk of contact with sick people.
Try to book a window seat, and avoid moving around the cabin during the flight.
After washing your hands and before sitting down, use disinfectant wipes to wipe down the area around your seat.
Wipe hard surfaces, and if your seat is leather you can wipe that too.
Don't wipe a cloth seat, as the moisture can make transmission easier.
When using disinfectant wipes, follow the instructions on the packaging.
And remember, viruses enter through your mouth, nose, and eyes – wiping down the area doesn't hurt, but it's not a substitute for proper hygiene.
Wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
And use a tissue to touch the touch screen or other controls.
When using the lavatory, use paper towels to turn off the faucet and open the door, then throw them away.
Airlines in affected areas are taking steps to reduce transmission and keep passengers safe.
For instance, these may include cleaning facilities more frequently, allowing flight attendants to wear masks, and serving prepackaged instead of freshly heated meals.
If a group of passengers is connecting from an area with a severe outbreak, the flight attendants may be able to seat them away from the rest of the passengers (and if you were recently in a high-risk area, consider telling the flight attendants for this reason).
You may be prohibited from changing seats on the flight.
This is so that, if someone on the flight turns out to be infected, the authorities can track down the people who were sitting near them for testing or quarantine.
COVID-19 is treated by relieving symptoms and preventing complications.
There is no vaccine or specific treatment for the novel coronavirus.
Research into a vaccine or specific antiviral drug is underway.
There are a variety of trials using HIV medications and other novel antiviral medications for treatment of COVID-19.
Mild symptoms may be relieved by taking paracetamol (acetaminophen).
If you are infected with COVID-19, countries will isolate you until several consecutive tests for COVID-19 are negative.
If you have been in close contact with someone infected with COVID-19, many countries will quarantine you for 14 days since the last exposure and monitor you for signs and symptoms.
Some countries will also test you even if you don't have symptoms.
In many countries, the healthcare system has been stretched to the point of not being able to handle the sheer number of patients, and there is a chance you may be refused treatment due to the lack of available medical staff, supplies or equipment.
Many countries have shut down or severely limited flights, ships, and border crossings, especially to and from affected areas.
Even more countries have imposed restrictions on arriving travelers, either barring entry (maybe with an exception for local citizens and permanent residents) or requiring you to be quarantined, typically for 14 days.
Even if a mandatory quarantine is not imposed, you may be asked to "self-quarantine" by staying at home and not interacting with other people.
The most severe restrictions are on travellers who have recently been to affected areas, but increasingly many countries are applying them to incoming travellers overall.
Some countries have even prohibited all or almost all foreigners from entry or limited the ability of local citizens and residents to leave.
What are the affected areas?
Well, this is a fast-changing situation, and each country/region/organization has its own list of what areas are subject to restrictions.
The city of Wuhan is on every list and the rest of mainland China is on most.
Other areas that are often included: France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Japan, Macau, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Schengen Area as a whole, and sometimes various others.
Some countries have imposed restrictions based on citizenship or residency from severely affected areas.
A detailed list of entry restrictions is maintained by the IATA.
It doesn't cover all the restrictions, but it's still useful.
Keep up to date—the outbreak and the travel restrictions are changing rapidly.
For travel in the near future, consider making refundable reservations in case the changing situation forces you to change your plans.
Avoid buying tickets with a connection in an affected area – even changing planes can make you subject to restrictions.
Flights may get canceled with little notice, either due to the disease's spread and ever-changing entry restrictions, or simply because fewer people are flying and airlines are having trouble filling seats.
You might also be delayed for hours upon arrival waiting for temperature checks and related procedures and paperwork, or even get quarantined for two weeks.
Be prepared for the possibility of disruption to your travel plans, especially if traveling internationally.
Even if you're nowhere near affected areas there's a risk that you'll have to stay at the destination longer than planned if you've shared a building or vessel with an infected person.
For example, in late February an Italian doctor on vacation in Costa Adeje (Canary Islands) was diagnosed with COVID-19, and as a result all the guests in the hotel he stayed at were quarantined.
Lockdowns and other internal restrictions
Some countries and regions, especially severely affected ones, are implementing emergency lockdowns and restrictions on people's movements and activities, even for those who haven't recently been abroad.
These include the temporary reintroduction of some border controls, restrictions on travel within the country, closing or limiting service at restaurants and other establishments, banning large public events, and in the most severe cases prohibiting people from leaving the house except for essential reasons.
Beyond government restrictions, individual establishments are shutting their doors and cancelling events to try to reduce the spread of the virus.
In China, there are extensive restrictions on transportation and activity, which vary widely by province, city, and even by district or village.
Many governments recommend against traveling to China at this time.
If you have no choice, do your research and get up-to-date information about the local situation wherever you are going.
People who have traveled to Hubei face particularly severe restrictions.
Examples of restrictions that you may encounter in some parts of China (this is not an exhaustive list):
14-day quarantine, self-quarantine, or COVID-19 test upon arrival from other parts of China or from other countries, at your expense
Questions about your travel and medical history (lying can get you years in prison)
Mandatory registration using an online or paper form
Requirement to wear a face mask in public
People who have been outside of China within 14 days not allowed into public places like malls
Shops only accept mobile payments, not cash
Restaurants, transportation and other establishments refusing service to non-Chinese citizens
Many forms of transportation reduced or shut down
Mandatory real-name registration for public transit cards
Access in and out of a town, village, or city completely blocked
Non-resident visitors prohibited from entering apartment complexes
Only allowed to go outside once every two days to get supplies
Businesses, activities, and attractions closed
Businesses need local government permission to re-open
Restaurants (if they are even open) require a minimum distance between customers
Selling substandard face masks has a maximum sentence of life imprisonment
As of mid-March 2020, Europe is the epicenter of the epidemic, and many European countries have closed their borders to international travel - only border commuters and freight are allowed to cross.
Also businesses other than food stores and pharmacies are closed, and public transport has been reduced or stopped.
In the worst affected countries including Italy, Spain and France, lockdowns like in China in January, have been implemented.
As well the EU has closed its outer borders.
COVID-19 is prevalent also in North America.
The borders between Canada, the U.S., and Mexico are closed to non-essential travel, and in many areas bans on big gatherings are in effect (this means places like restaurants are closed, and events are canceled).
Numerous state, county, and municipal jurisdictions have issued stay-at-home orders that require all nonessential businesses to close.
With lots of flights canceled, warnings issued, and restrictions imposed, flying in the time of coronavirus can be a challenge.
Some routes are not possible.
Others will require more inconvenient connections than usual—multiple stops and long waits between flights.
In some cases that means more expensive tickets.
On the other hand, the good news is that many flights are cheaper than usual due to decreased demand, and there's a decent chance you'll get an empty seat next to you.
Build in extra time for your connections, especially if transferring from an international flight to a domestic flight and especially if your itinerary involves a country that's seriously affected.
Screenings, temperature checks, extra paperwork, and the associated waiting around can add minutes or hours before you're allowed to continue on your journey.
You may find it harder than usual to buy a ticket to or from a destination subject to warnings and restrictions.
This is a real concern if you're trying to get out of an affected area.
For instance, most aggregators are not selling tickets from China to the United States (presumably to avoid falling afoul of restrictions and being on the hook for a passenger's flight out).
To buy a ticket for an itinerary like this, you may have to contact the airline or use a lesser-known aggregator.
Another possibility is to buy two separate tickets (for instance, a ticket from China to Cambodia and a second ticket from Cambodia to the U.S.), but be careful you won't get quarantined or lose your luggage in between.
Connecting flights can be a problem.
The risk of getting stuck in the connection city is higher than usual right now, due to delays for screening and testing as well as extensive cancellations.
Connecting in an affected area may lead to entry restrictions later on, and if you've been in an affected area recently some countries won't even let you change planes.
On certain itineraries there is a risk of getting quarantined somewhere along the way.
So book a direct flight if you can, and if not, think carefully about where to connect.
In uncertain times, plans can change.
Many embassies and consulates have evacuated nonessential staff, and some have shut down operations completely.
Emergency assistance should still be available, though it's possible you may have to contact a further-away consulate if your local one has shut down.
If you have been stranded due to the pandemic, your nearest consulate may be able to help you find a flight home, arrange an emergency loan so you can buy a ticket, or provide an emergency passport.
At the very least they can keep you informed about the local situation and notify you about recently introduced travel requirements and restrictions.
Ordinary consular services such as visa and passport processing may be suspended or restricted to urgent need, depending on the location and the consulate.
Although some people call the disease "Wuhan pneumonia" (武汉(漢)肺炎/武肺), "Wuhan disease", or "Chinese virus", the use of these terms is considered racist in China and by many people of Chinese origin.
It is still common to refer the disease as "Wuhan pneumonia" or "Chinese virus" in places like Hong Kong and Taiwan.
To be safe, use location-neutral terms when referring to the disease, such as "COVID-19", "novel coronavirus", or just "the virus" or "the pandemic".
Particularly in developing countries where law enforcement are poorly trained, enforcement of curfew, lockdown or stay-at-home orders are often brutal, often using forces not proportionate against crowds.
Comply with these orders, and avoid crowds in public.
As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, xenophobia has risen in many countries, primarily but not exclusively targeting people perceived to be Chinese.
There has been a worldwide spike in racist incidents targeting people of East Asian origin, including in major cities such as New York, London and San Francisco.
In Hong Kong, Sinophobia, which was already high to begin with, has intensified as a result of the pandemic, with the result that many shops and restaurants are now denying service to mainland Chinese customers and banning Mandarin speakers from their premises (with the exception of Taiwanese).
Levels of xenophobia have also risen in East Asia, with some restaurants and other businesses in Japan and China refusing service to foreign customers.
In China, there have been incidents of foreigners being refused rooms by hotel staff, and foreign residents, particularly black people, being kicked out of their apartments on short notice by their landlords.

A variety of misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus are being promoted online and even by some government officials, so be careful which sources you check for information.
Ensure that all information and advice you receive has been backed by reputable doctors and scientists.
In a crisis, it's natural to want to keep following the latest updates, but it may be better for your mental health to moderate the amount of news that you look at, and stick to reliable news sources.
If you normally watch the news twice per day then stick to this schedule and do something else, rather than having the 24-hour news on continuously.
B'Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1 (Bat SL-CoV-WIV1), also sometimes called SARS-like coronavirus WIV1, is a strain of Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) isolated from Chinese rufous horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus).
Like all coronaviruses, virions consist of single-stranded positive-sense RNA enclosed within an envelope.
The discovery confirms that bats are the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis shows the possibility of direct transmission of SARS from bats to humans without the intermediary Chinese civets, as previously believed.
B'COVID-19 drug development is the research process to develop a preventative vaccine or therapeutic prescription drug that would alleviate the severity of 2019-20 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The International Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the WHO recorded 536 clinical studies to develop post-infection therapies for COVID-19 infections, with numerous established antiviral compounds for treating other infections under clinical research to be repurposed.
In March, the WHO initiated the "SOLIDARITY Trial" in 10 countries, enrolling thousands of people infected with COVID-19 to assess treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promise of efficacy.
A dynamic, systematic review was established in April 2020 to track the progress of registered clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic drug candidates.Vaccine and drug development is a multistep process, typically requiring more than five years to assure safety and efficacy of the new compound.
Drug development is the process of bringing a new infectious disease vaccine or therapeutic drug to the market once a lead compound has been identified through the process of drug discovery.
It includes laboratory research on microorganisms and animals, filing for regulatory status, such as via the FDA, for an investigational new drug to initiate clinical trials on humans, and may include the step of obtaining regulatory approval with a new drug application to market the drug.
Development of a COVID-19 vaccine or therapeutic antiviral drug begins with matching a chemical concept to the potential prophylactic mechanism of the future vaccine or antiviral activity in vivo.
New chemical entities (NCEs, also known as new molecular entities or NMEs) are compounds that emerge from the process of drug discovery to specify a vaccine or antiviral candidate.
These have promising activity against a biological target related to COVID-19 disease.
At the beginning of vaccine or drug development, little is known about the safety, toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of the NCE in humans.
It is the function and obligation of drug development to assess all of these parameters prior to human clinical trials to prove safety and efficacy.
A further major objective of drug development is to recommend the dose and schedule for the first use in a human clinical trial ("first-in-human" [FIH] or First Human Dose [FHD], previously also known as "first-in-man" [FIM]).
In addition, drug development must establish the physicochemical properties of the NCE: its chemical makeup, stability, and solubility.
Manufacturers must optimize the process they use to make the chemical so they can scale up from a medicinal chemist producing milligrams, to manufacturing on the kilogram and ton scale.
They further examine the product for suitability to package as capsules, tablets, aerosol, intramuscular injectable, subcutaneous injectable, or intravenous formulations.
Together, these processes are known in preclinical and clinical development as chemistry, manufacturing, and control (CMC).Many aspects of drug development focus on satisfying the regulatory requirements of drug licensing authorities.
These generally constitute tests designed to determine the major toxicities of a novel compound prior to first use in humans.
The Canadian government announced CA$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including numerous vaccine candidates at Canadian universities, with plans to establish a "vaccine bank" of new vaccines for implementation if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
Clinical trial programs involve three, multiple-year stages toward product approval, and a fourth, post-approval stage for ongoing safety monitoring of the vaccine or drug therapy:
Phase I trials, usually in healthy volunteers, determine safety and dosing.
Phase II trials are used to establish an initial reading of efficacy and further explore safety in small numbers of people having the disease targeted by the NCE.
Phase III trials are large, pivotal trials to determine safety and efficacy in sufficiently large numbers of people with the COVID-19 infection.
If safety and efficacy are adequately proved, clinical testing may stop at this step and the NCE advances to the new drug application (NDA) stage to begin marketing.
Phase IV trials are post-approval trials that may be a condition attached by the FDA, also called post-market surveillance studies.
In addition to the tests required to move a novel vaccine or antiviral drug into the clinic for the first time, manufacturers must ensure that any long-term or chronic toxicities are well-defined, including effects on systems not previously monitored (fertility, reproduction, immune system, among others).
The Wuhan Laboratory has been promptly followed by Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
By 4 March 2020 the daily throughput totals were 50,000 tests per day.Open source, multiplexed designs released by Origami Assays have been released that can test as many as 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 assays . These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for robotic liquid handlers.
By March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagent has become a bottleneck for mass testing in the EU and UK and the US.
This has led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing.On 31 March it was announced United Arab Emirates was now testing more of its population for Coronavirus per head than any other country, and was on track to scale up the level of testing to reach the bulk of the population.
This was through a combination of drive-through capability, and purchasing a population-scale mass-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Constructed in 14 days, the lab is capable of conducting tens of thousands RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world of this scale to be operational outside of China.
Different testing recipes targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German recipe for manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop their own.
The German recipe was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, delaying available tests in the U.S.China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to satisfy demand and recommendations for testing by health experts.
In contrast, experts say South Korea's broad availability of testing helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Testing capacity, largely in private sector labs, was built up over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for ramping up the testing programmes as the best way to slow the advance of COVID-19 pandemic.High demand for testing due to wide spread of the virus caused backlogs of hundreds of thousands of tests at private U.S. labs, and supplies of swabs and chemical reagents became strained.
In March 2020 China reported problems with accuracy in their test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "flaws;" the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing.Spain purchased test kits from Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that results were inaccurate.
The firm explained that the incorrect results may be a result of a failure to collect samples or use the kits correctly.
The Spanish ministry said it will withdraw the kits that returned incorrect results, and would replace them with a different testing kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of test kits the Czech Republic purchased from China gave wrong results.Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China which were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested these be dumped into the Danube.Ateş Kara of the Turkish Health Ministry said the test kits Turkey purchased from China had a "high error rate" and did not "put them into use."The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 announced these were not usable.
Testing, followed with quarantine of those who tested positive and tracing of those with whom the SARS-CoV-2 positive people had had contact, resulted in positive outcomes.
Researchers working in the Italian town of Vò, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing on the entire population of about 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
About half the people testing positive had no symptoms, and all discovered cases were quarantined.
With travel to the commune restricted, this eliminated new infections completely.
With aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has proceeded much more slowly than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions like forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore did start advising residents to stay at home on 28 March, but schools reopened on time after holiday break on 23 March.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic with aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, but with less aggressive lock-downs, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study has found that countries that have tested more, relative to the number of deaths, have much lower case fatality rates, probably because these countries are better able to detect those with only mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID-19 send their first five positives and the first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Out of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the column “Positive as % of tests” is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that only tests people admitted to hospitals will have a higher positive as % of tests than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they are showing symptoms, other things being equal.
Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands for the purpose of removing soil, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Hand washing with soap consistently at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted through fecal–oral route.
People can also become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day where washing hands with soap is important include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child's bottom or changing nappies, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash.The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing the diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet.
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animal, animal feed, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medicine or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of washing hands is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals which can cause harm or diseases.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; decreasing respiratory infections;
And reducing infant mortality rate at home birth deliveries.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand washing practices may lead to small improvements in the length growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, childhood mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the rate of mortality from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhoea episodes by about a third, and this is comparable to providing clean water in low income areas.
48% of reductions in diarrhoea episodes can be associated with hand washing with soap.Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), as automatic behavior performed in homes, schools, and communities worldwide.
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the number one cause of mortality among children under five years old, taking the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for almost 3.5 million child deaths annually.
According to UNICEF, turning hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet into an ingrained habit can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, cutting deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by one-quarter.
Hand washing is usually integrated together with other sanitation interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small detrimental effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to an itchy, flaky skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among health-care workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times during the day where washing hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of disease: after using the bathroom (urination, defecation), after cleaning a child's bottom (changing nappies), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other occasions when correct handwashing technique should be practiced in order to prevent the transmission of disease include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of hand washing with soap.
A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average, 38.7% of households practiced hand washing with soap.A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; the United States near the middle with 77 percent; and China with the lowest rate of 23 percent.Several behaviour change methodologies now exist to increase uptake of the behaviour of hand washing with soap at the critical times.Group hand washing for school children at set times of the day is one option in developing countries to engrain hand washing in children's behaviors.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of at scale action to promote children's health and education.
Deworming twice a year, supplemented with washing hands daily with soap, brushing teeth daily with fluoride, is at the core of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removal of microorganisms from skin is enhanced by the addition of soaps or detergents to water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soil, are not readily dissolved in water.
Cleansing is, however, aided by a reasonable flow of water..
Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, may hold bacteria acquired from previous uses.
A small number of studies which have looked at the bacterial transfer from contaminated solid soap have concluded transfer is unlikely as the bacteria are rinsed off with the foam.
The CDC still states "liquid soap with hands-free controls for dispensing is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted to a health-conscious public.
To date, there is no evidence that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants selects for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
So, even if antibiotic resistant strains aren't selected for by antibacterial soaps, they might not be as effective as they are marketed to be.
Besides the surfactant and skin-protecting agent, the sophisticated formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulator, antimicrobially active benzoic acid and further skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that plain soaps are as effective as consumer-grade anti-bacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing illness and removing bacteria from the hands.
Hot water that is comfortable for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water at removing natural oils which hold soils and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief however, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent.
In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, alcohol rub non-water-based hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated together with a thickening agent such as Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) into a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin into a liquid, or foam for ease of use and to decrease the drying effect of the alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen-peroxide increases further the antimicrobial activity.Hand sanitizers containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol are efficient germ killers.
Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 log reduction, similar to 35 decibel reduction) of the bacteria on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of the bacteria on hands 1 minute after application.Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis.Enough hand antiseptic or alcohol rub must be used to thoroughly wet or cover both hands.
The front and back of both hands and between and the ends of all fingers are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
Finger tips must be washed well too, rubbing them in both palms.The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing over hand sanitizer rubs, particularly when hands are visibly dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid killing activity against micro-organisms; however, they should not serve as a replacement for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused substantially less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol hand rubs rarely occur.
The lower tendency to induce irritant contact dermatitis became an attraction as compared to soap and water hand washing.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not cleanse the hands of organic material, but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water at preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the pathogens still remain on the hands.
Alcohol-free hand sanitizer efficacy is heavily dependent on the ingredients and formulation, and historically has significantly under-performed alcohol and alcohol rubs.
More recently, formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to decrease in efficacy after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms it may increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfecting agent because in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommended ash or sand as alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Correct handwashing technique recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control for prevention of transmission of disease includes the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because standing basins may be contaminated, while the temperature of the water does not seem to make a difference.
Lather hands by rubbing them with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of hands, between fingers, and under nails.
Soap lifts germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when soap is used rather than water alone.
Scrub for at least 20 seconds.
Scrubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from skin, and scrubbing for longer periods removes more germs.
Rinse well under running water.
Rinsing in a basin can recontaminate hands.
Dry with a clean towel or allow to air dry.
Wet and moist hands are more easily recontaminated.The most commonly missed areas are the thumb, the wrist, the areas between the fingers, and under fingernails.
Artificial nails and chipped nail polish may harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep the hands from drying out; dry skin can lead to skin damage which can increase the risk for the transmission of infection.
Various low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing where tap-water and/or soap is not available e.g. pouring water from a hanging jerrycan or gourd with suitable holes and/or using ash if needed in developing countries.In situations with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-conserving solutions, such as "tippy-taps" and other low-cost options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology using a jug suspended by a rope, and a foot-operated lever to pour a small amount of water over the hands and a bar of soap.
Effective drying of the hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate over the most effective form of drying in public washrooms.
A growing volume of research suggests paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many washrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper-towel industry the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, warm-air hand dryers and the more modern jet-air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the warm-air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase on average on the finger pads by 194% and on the palms by 254%.
Drying with the jet-air dryer resulted in an increase on average of the total number of bacteria on the finger pads by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced on average on the finger pads by up to 76% and on the palms by up to 77%.The scientists also carried out tests to establish whether there was the potential for cross contamination of other washroom users and the washroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The jet-air dryer, which blows air out of the unit at claimed speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was capable of blowing micro-organisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminating other washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 metres away.
Use of a warm-air hand dryer spread micro-organisms up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of micro-organisms.In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
The following changes in the bacterial count after drying the hands were observed:
Many different hand dryer manufacturers exist, and hand driers have been compared against drying with paper towels.
Hand washing using hand sanitizing wipes is an alternative during traveling in the absence of soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand-washing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study has found decreased infection rates with their use.
Medical hand-washing is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to lather and rub each part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed together with digits interlocking.
If there is debris under fingernails, a bristle brush may be used to remove it.
Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to turn off the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This avoids re-contaminating the hands from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand-washing in the health-care setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid transmitting them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that a lack of hand-washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with large numbers of doctors and nurses routinely forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand-washing and other simple procedures can decrease the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent.The World Health Organization has published a sheet demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-rubbing in health-care sectors.
The draft guidance of hand hygiene by the organization can also be found at its website for public comment.
A relevant review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene, if demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Moments" for washing hands:
After exposure to blood/body fluids
Before an aseptic task, and
After patient care.The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap ("medicated" or "antimicrobial" soaps) confers killing action to a hand-washing agent.
Such killing action may be desired prior to performing surgery or in settings in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly prevalent.To 'scrub' one's hands for a surgical operation, it is necessary to have a tap that can be turned on and off without touching it with the hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, sterile towels for drying the hands after washing, and a sterile brush for scrubbing and another sterile instrument for cleaning under the fingernails.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.
Long scrub-times (10 minutes) are not necessary.
When rinsing, water on the forearms must be prevented from running back to the hands.
After hand-washing is completed, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is donned.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash the hands or use a hand antiseptic before and after tending to a sick person.
For control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from hand-cleansing came from the first 20% of washing, and that very little additional benefit was gained when hand cleansing frequency was increased beyond 35%.
Washing with plain soap results in more than triple the rate of bacterial infectious disease transmitted to food as compared to washing with antibacterial soap.Comparing hand-rubbing with alcohol-based solution with hand washing with antibacterial soap for a median time of 30 seconds each showed that the alcohol hand-rubbing reduced bacterial contamination 26% more than the antibacterial soap.
But soap and water is more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs for reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores from hands.Interventions to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings can involve education for staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand rub, and written and verbal reminders to staff.
There is a need for more research into which of these interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective, essential tool for achieving good health, and even good nutrition.
However, a lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, at schools and at the workplace make it a challenge to achieve universal hand washing behaviors.
For example, in most of rural Africa hand washing taps close to every private or public toilet are scarce, even though cheap options exist to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates rather can also be the result of engrained habits rather than due to a lack of soap or water.
The promotion and advocacy of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term behavior change of the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective at increasing hand washing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective.One example for hand washing promotion in schools is the "Three Star Approach" by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygienic requirements.
When minimum standards are achieved, schools can move from one to ultimately three stars.
Building hand washing stations can be a part of hand washing promotion campaigns that are carried out in order to reduce diseases and child mortality.
Global Hand washing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that is trying to achieve behavior change.As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the adoption of a handwashing emoji.
Few studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relationship to DALYs averted.
However, one review suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health – particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances like mothers who had just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals – was first recognized in the mid 19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At that time most people still believed that infections were caused by foul odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and healthcare-associated infections led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to increased awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect oneself from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "correct hand washing techniques" were hung up next to hand washing sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing one's hands of" something, means declaring one's unwillingness to take responsibility for the thing or share complicity in it.
It originates from the bible passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a phrase with a much wider usage in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse an imagined stain, representing her guilty conscience regarding crimes she had committed and induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, after having recalled or contemplated unethical acts, tend to wash hands more often than others, and tend to value hand washing equipment more.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such a contemplation are less likely to engage in other "cleansing" compensatory actions, such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes.Symbolic hand washing, using water but no soap to wash hands, is a part of ritual hand washing featured in many religions, including Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam.Religions also prescribe hygienic hand washing, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam mandate washing of hands after using the toilet.
And, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam mandate washing of hands before and after every meal.
Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19
Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational safety and health methodologies for hazard controls to the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper hazard controls in the workplace depend on the worksite and job task, based on a risk assessment of sources of exposure, disease severity in the community, and risk factors of individual workers who may be vulnerable to contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), lower exposure risk jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory etiquette, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfecting of the work environment.
Medium exposure risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected with COVID-19, but may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, high-population-density work environments, and some high-volume retail settings.
Hazard controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneeze guards, and having personal protective equipment available in case a person with COVID-19 is encountered.
OSHA considers healthcare and mortuary workers exposed to known or suspected person with COVID-19 to be at high exposure risk, which increases to very high exposure risk if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures on, or collect or handle specimens from, known or suspected person with COVID-19.
Hazard controls appropriate for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate to the job task.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several effects within the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to becoming sick, needing to care for others, or from fear of possible exposure.
Patterns of commerce may change, both in terms of what goods are demanded, and the means of acquiring these goods (such as shopping at off-peak hours or through delivery or drive-through services).
Lastly, shipments of items from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted.An infectious disease preparedness and response plan can be used to guide protective actions.
Plans address the levels of risk associated with various worksites and job tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and risk factors of individual workers such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline controls necessary to address those risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
Objectives for response to an outbreak include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people who are at higher risk for adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The disease severity in the community where the business is located affects the responses taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to group hazard controls by effectiveness.
Where COVID-19 hazards cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and lastly personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in work policy or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected based upon the hazard to the worker, properly fitted as applicable (e.g., respirators), consistently and properly worn, regularly inspected, maintained, and replaced, as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned, and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), lower exposure risk jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory etiquette including covering coughs and sneezes, providing tissues and trash receptacles, preparing for telecommuting or staggered shifts if needed, discouraging workers from using others' tools and equipment, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfecting of the work environment.
Prompt identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a critical step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at a worksite.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness are to stay home until they are free of fever, signs of a fever, and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medicines, and that sick leave policies are flexible, permit employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, medium exposure risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of people who are not known or suspected COVID-19 patients, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the business location, or because the individual has recent international travel to a location with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, high-population-density work environments, and some high-volume retail settings.Engineering controls for this and higher risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as clear plastic sneeze guards, and installing a drive-through window for customer service.Administrative controls for this and higher risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, establishing staggered shifts, discontinuing nonessential travel to locations with ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks, developing emergency communications plans including a forum for answering workers’ concerns, providing workers with up-to-date education and training on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behaviors, training workers who need to use protecting clothing and equipment how to use it, providing resources and a work environment that promotes personal hygiene, requiring regular hand washing, limiting customers' and the public's access to the worksite, and posting signage about hand washing and other COVID-19 protective measures.Depending on the work task, workers with at least medium exposure risk may need to wear personal protective equipment including some combination of gloves, a gown, a face shield or face mask, or goggles.
Workers in this risk group rarely require use of respirators.
If a person becomes sick on an airplane, proper controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others by a distance of 6 feet, designating one crew member to serve the sick person, and offering a face mask to the sick person or asking the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when tending to a sick traveler or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick traveler has fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, hazard controls include postponing travel when sick, and self-isolating and informing the onboard medical center immediately if one develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should occur in the isolated person's cabin.For schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person has been in a school building regardless of community spread.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented such as canceling field trips, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or meals in a cafeteria, increasing the space between desks, staggering arrival and dismissal times, limiting nonessential visitors, and using a separate health office location for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is substantial transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school dismissals may be considered.For law enforcement personnel performing daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by CDC.
Law enforcement officials who must make contact with individuals confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including proper personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during apprehension, workers should clean and disinfect their duty belt and gear prior to reuse using a household cleaning spray or wipe, and follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE and for containing and laundering clothes.
OSHA considers certain healthcare and mortuary workers to be at high or very high categories of exposure risk.
High exposure risk jobs include healthcare delivery, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These become very high exposure risk if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures on, or collect or handle specimens from, known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol-generating procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopies, some dental procedures and exams, or invasive specimen collection.
High exposure risk mortuary jobs include workers involved in preparing the bodies of people who had known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of their death; these become very high exposure risk if they perform an autopsy.Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with known or suspected COVID-19, including when aerosol-generating procedures are performed.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare and mortuary settings.
Specimens should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be separated into distinct waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspected COVID-19 case.In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for those who work within 6 feet of patients known to be, or suspected of being, infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those performing aerosol-generating procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators or better must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes fit-testing, training, and medical exams.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort.The WHO does not recommend coveralls, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through bodily fluids.
WHO recommends only a surgical mask for point-of-entry screening personnel.
For those who are collecting respiratory specimens from, caring for, or transporting COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-generating procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles, or face shield, gown, and gloves.
If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE necessary for the specific task, continuing use of the same respirator without removing it while caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

SUBJECT LINE: [Covid-19] Lightening the load and preparing for the future
SEND DATE/TIME: 14 March, 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENSING: CC0: No rights reserved
We find ourselves in remarkable circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear our global human interconnectedness and the responsibilities we have to one another.
We don’t have precedent for its challenges, but we do know that our best response relies on the sort of global empathy, cooperation, and community building that sits at the heart of this organization.
The camaraderie and care we have seen among all of our colleagues over email, calls, and chats is a remarkable validation of the incredible humans we are fortunate enough to work with.
I couldn’t be more grateful and proud to count you all as colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They reminded me how meaningful it is for the world to be able to turn to Wikipedia right now, and what a powerful symbol it is for this critical resource to remain online and available to all.
Your work makes this possible, whether you keep the sites stay up or our colleagues paid or our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, now more than ever.
This is a moment in which not only what we do, but how we do it, will make a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will be making some significant adjustments to how we work together, starting this coming week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned previously, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we’re facing and the best way to keep the organization sustainable during this time.
Overwhelmingly we wanted to remove stress and support our mission for the long term.
If you need to dial back, that’s okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily working expectations will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We’re not declaring a holiday - if you are able to work more normal hours, the mission can use you.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and whether you need to care for loved ones, get groceries, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We are not tracking your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
This should go without saying, but we’re saying it.
No sick days or PTO required - just tell your manager and help your team revise calendars and schedules to make sure key areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive for COVID-19, please let Bryan within T&amp;C Ops know so T&amp;C can help with support and make sure your situation gets appropriate attention from management).
Hourly folks will be fully paid.
We have already said, and are recommitting to honor our commitments to our contractors and hourly staff colleagues.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their usual hours worked during normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way of channeling their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially during times like this.
Again, this is about your self-care.
Our ask is that you communicate with your manager, so we know what to expect and can adjust accordingly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are some things that we must keep doing.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp; Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) do critical work that may need additional support.
We’ll begin a process with all departments to assess current objectives and shift our focus to supporting what’s essential for our mission.
There’s plenty to do for all of us, we just will all focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing now won’t hurt later.
We do not plan to go “double-time to catch up” once the pandemic has passed.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines which are now unrealistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and will work to set new targets and timelines where appropriate.
What happens with the APP (Annual Planning)?
To adjust to our new reality and daily working hour expectations, we intend to adjust the timeline for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that allows more time for budgeting to allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care, and care for loved ones while accommodating those who need or wish to work a reduced schedule over the next few weeks.
This timeline extension greatly reduces current planning workloads and pressure across the whole organization.
We will introduce our proposal to the Board next week and will update delegates and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Office status, exposure, and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of an abundance of caution, we employed an antiviral cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They utilized a hospital-grade anti-viral solution to disinfect every surface, as well as the lobby and elevator banks accessing our floor.
The building is employing its own duty-of-care protocol utilizing products that support the safety of their tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office will be well-prepared for when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC-based staff members.
As of last week, our DC office moved to a fully remote setup in line with the guidance shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, we have also been in discussion about leasing a location in Brooklyn.
These discussions are continuing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-time remote colleagues know that it can be an adjustment, and wanted to offer you some advice:
Limit the length of meetings to at most one or two hour increments.
If longer sessions are required, consider how they can be broken up over the course of several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have an agenda, and send reading materials in advance.
Make video the default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and connection.
Have a lead to facilitate every meeting, someone to monitor the chat for questions and track the speaker list, and someone to help take notes (or do collaborative note-taking).
Send an email to tech support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your wellness reimbursement for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk with your colleagues about distributed work
The HR Operations team is looking into webinar-based ergonomics guidance to support the increase in distributed work across the Foundation.
This past week we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as editathons, until the WHO declares the pandemic to be over.
We let them know that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible to complete their agreed-upon grant activities and that no one would be penalized for having to delay or modify those goals.
This coming week we will follow up with additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general sentiment from around the global community seems to be both sadness at the disruption but relief at the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and otherwise.
Going forward, the CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Staying in touch around COVID-19 related issues
We’ll be sending an invitation to your calendars for next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We’ll use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
We’re in this together and here to help however we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information from this email, and all other essential COVID-19 related information, on Office Wiki.
The CRT will keep these pages updated and all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff who reside in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workstream, or coverage challenge, or anything else you may need help with, please don’t hesitate to notify and work with the CRT.
We’re here to help provide support and liaise as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please email Bryan Judan - Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as an abandonment of our work and obligations.
Rather, they are a recognition that at this moment, our work and obligations will likely need to adapt in a way we have not in the past.
These are the steps we believe are necessary to support this one another so that we can continue to work, provide our movement with the support they need, and the world with the service they rely on.
Our planned work will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support one another and create space for the important work that will be coming in the weeks and potentially months ahead.
We need all of you to make that happen, and so we need you all to take care of yourself and your families so that you can be at your best when the need arises.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don’t touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
B'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ACE2 counters the activity of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang(1-7) making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular diseases.ACE2 also serves as the entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of cells in lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood stream and ultimately excreted into urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of mainly lung type II alveolar cells, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a counter balance to ACE.
ACE cleaves angiotensin I hormone into the vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 in turn cleaves the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also cleave a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane trafficking of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been implicated in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells results in endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into endosomes located within cells.
This entry process also requires priming of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is under current investigation as a potential therapeutic.This has led some to hypothesize that decreasing the levels of ACE2, in cells, might help in fighting the infection.
However, multiple professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that "use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in risk of pneumonia compared with controls."
Moreover, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk of pneumonia, in particular those with stroke and heart failure.
Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia related mortality, although the results were less robust than for overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is surmised to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with a lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in human beings is about 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the course of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where circulating angiotensin II is elevated.Infused rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
B'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to aid contact tracing in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying persons ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected individual.
Numerous applications were developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for building contact tracing apps have been developed.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially about systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of app users.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in conjunction with Alipay, has deployed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people that have COVID-19.
It is in use across more than 200 Chinese cities.In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to trace exposure with potentially infected persons and provide a fast response to healthcare authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracing app was in an advanced stage of development, and would be available for deployment within weeks.A similar app is planned in Ireland, and in France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, listed a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if takeup of the app is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple set limits on which types of organizations could add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, limiting them to only "official" or otherwise reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners voiced their concern regarding the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, in particular about whether surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance.
The organisations declared eight conditions on governmental projects:
Surveillance would have to be "lawful, necessary and proportionate";
Extensions of monitoring and surveillance would have to have sunset clauses;
The use of data would have to be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data security and anonymity would have to be protected and shown to be protected based on evidence;
Digital surveillance would have to avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalisation;
Any sharing of data with third parties would have to be defined in law;
There would have to be safeguards against abuse and the rights of citizens to respond to abuses;
Meaningful participation by all "relevant stakeholders" would be required, including that of public health experts and marginalised groups.The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also issued checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan intends to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracing mechanism from their device operating systems once it is no longer needed.
Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to perform contact tracing.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system gathered tracking information from a variety of sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined these to generate notices via text messages to potentially-infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made the location information publicly available, something permitted because of far-reaching changes to information privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public via a number of apps and websites.Countries including Germany considered using both centralized and privacy-preserving systems.
As of 6 April 2020, the details had not yet been released.
Privacy-preserving contact tracing is a well-established concept, with a substantial body of research literature dating back to at least 2013.As of 7 April 2020, over a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log a user's proximity to other cellphones.
However, PEPP-PT is a co-ordination effort which contains both centralised and decentralised approaches, and is not a single protocol.Decentralised protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all matching happens on-device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has been developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or path intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the whitepaper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020.Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technologies that was also originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace utilizes secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the global TCN Coalition was founded by groups that had coalesced around what was essentially the same approach and largely overlapping protocols, with the goal to reduce fragmentation, and enable global interoperability of tracing and alerting apps, a key aspect of achieving widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singaporean government announced that it had open-sourced the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing, which they claimed would preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy-preserving cryptography.
They also published specifications of the core technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be rolled out in three stages:
Rollout of tools to enable governments to create official privacy-preserving coronavirus tracing apps
Integration of this functionality directly into iOS and AndroidGoogle and Apple plan to address the take-up and persistent surveillance problems by first distributing the system through operating system updates, and later removing it in the same way once the threat has passed.
B'Drug repositioning (also known as drug repurposing, re-profiling, re-tasking or therapeutic switching) is the repurposing of an approved drug for the treatment of a different disease or medical condition than that for which it was originally developed.
This is one line of scientific research which is currently being pursued to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma transfusion.SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 druggable proteins, each of which has multiple ligand binding sites.
Analyzing those binding sites provide the reasonable project of developing effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like protease, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A A, et al studied several candidate compounds which then optimized and analyzed for their skeleton similarity with the highest similar approved drugs in order to accelerate a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug development in his preclinical study to be recommended in a clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial medication that is also used against some auto-immune diseases.
On 18 March, the WHO announced that chloroquine and the related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on 24 March.On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA's clinical trials process and is authorized under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but are not able to receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC has said that "the use, dosing, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" are not yet established.
Doctors have said they are using the drug when "there's no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of preventative use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show favipiravir was "clearly effective".
35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative in a median of 4 days, while the length of illness was 11 days in the 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half were given favipiravir and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence in support of the drug is scant and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan for its stockpile, and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made overtures to the Trump administration about purchasing the drug.The drug may be less effective in severe cases of illness where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or those trying to conceive.
One study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV from replicating by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that will bind with the protease of SARS-CoV-2.There are criticisms within the scientific community about directing resources to repurposing drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections . Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple filo-, pneumo-, paramyxo-, and corona- viruses .
One issue with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pretrial studies suggest remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance.There are several clinical trials underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one for people with moderate illness and another for those with more severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19; two placebo controlled (China, Canada) and one with no control (Italy).
New York State began trials for the antibiotic azithromycin on 24 March 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for Teijin's Alvesco (ciclesonide), an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the novel coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a Phase II trial is underway with 200 patients to be recruited from severe, hospitalized cases in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients suffering from mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, named COLCORONA, is recruiting 6000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and experience mild symptoms not requiring hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who do not have an effective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is being widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study on 300 patients researching the use of enoxaparin sodium at prophylaxis and therapeutic dosages was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on repurposing approved anti-viral drugs that were developed for prior outbreaks such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially repurposable as COVID-19 treatments:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by China.
Also trials in Italy and China. and see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
B'A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are multiple attempts in progress to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to become available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to considerable investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Stated in April, imperatives of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, deployment at scale, and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Major platform targets advanced into Phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are in early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (presumed to be in planning or being designed).
A Phase I-II trial conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing, is typically randomized, placebo-controlled, and at multiple sites, while determining more precise, effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and test effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while monitoring for adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (still in "preclinical" research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins in order to stimulate an immune reaction.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the commencement of work on a vaccine, aiming to start human testing in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020, and the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that it had begun work on developing a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the laboratory OncoGen in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine with similar technology to the one used for cancer neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On 25 March the head of the research institute announced that they had finalized the synthesis of the vaccine and were beginning the tests.
On 27 February 2020, a Generex subsidiary company, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced they were beginning a vaccine project to create an Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans "within 90 days."
On 5 March 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced they were working on a vaccine.
Around 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had teamed with Novavax Inc.
In the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners further announced plans for preclinical testing and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, India's Health Ministry announced they are working with 11 isolates, and that even on a fast track it would take at least around one-and-a-half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported development of a coronavirus-like particle under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, with human testing planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that the US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "'large sums of money' for exclusive access to a Covid-19 vaccine", against which the German government protested.
On 17 March 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop a mRNA-based vaccine.
MRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162, currently in pre-clinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company announced they will have pre-clinical testing results in April 2020 and their final vaccine candidate could begin human testing by fall.
In France on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced a US$4.9 million investment in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI's total investment in COVID-19 vaccine development to US$29 million.
CEPI's other investment partners for COVID-19 vaccine development are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have begun animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Imperial College London researchers announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including numerous vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically for developing a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on testing of PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines elicited potent antigen-specific antibody responses [in the mice] that were evident beginning 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a possible nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, the DNA will be designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which may stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities pooled resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
A further randomized trial in Australia is seeking to enrol 4,170 healthcare workers.
It is possible vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
Early research to assess vaccine efficacy using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, indicate a need for biosafety-level 3 containment measures for handling live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became prevalent, it was believed that existing SARS research may provide a useful template for developing vaccines and therapeutics against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA based) MERS vaccine which completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others in progress, all of which are viral-vectored vaccines, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory claiming the virus behind COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social media posts reference existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as the SARS coronavirus.
B'Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.
While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact, often via small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
While these droplets are produced when breathing out, they usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than being infectious over long distances.
People may also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for mask use by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending against their use, some recommending their use, and others requiring their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.
Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented only with chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease may progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.Reports indicate that not all who are infected develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not display symptoms is currently unknown and being studied, with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Loud talking releases more droplets than normal talking.
A study in Singapore found that an uncovered cough can lead to droplets travelling up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Though the virus is not generally airborne, the National Academy of Science has suggested that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and air collectors positioned in the hallway outside of people's rooms yielded samples positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be aerosolised and thus result in airborne spread.
While there are concerns it may spread via feces, this risk is believed to be low.The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; while spread may be possible before symptoms emerge, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others.The virus survives for hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for one day on cardboard, for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and for up to four hours on 99% copper.
This, however, varies depending on the humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if correctly used; soap products degrade the virus' fatty protective layer, deactivating it, as well as freeing them from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective.In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken a median of two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day tested.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted in hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe disease.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms is high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis.Autopsies of people who died of COVID-19 have found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so laboratories across the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infections and whether a person had been infected in the past) were in development, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese experience with testing has shown the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month.Diagnostic guidelines released by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting infections based upon clinical features and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in early infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
Few data are available about microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings at autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, lung consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multinucleated giant cell formation
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Healing pneumonia: organisation of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least 20 seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available.
Proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged.
The CDC has recommended the use of cloth face coverings in public settings, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals.Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected persons with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
Distancing guidelines also include that people stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There is no medication known to be effective at preventing COVID-19.As a vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest, a key part of managing COVID-19 is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's nose, coughing or sneezing.
It further recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available.For areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a humectant.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they carry the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the issue of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may be useful in those with mild symptoms at the early stage of infection.The WHO and Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for taking care of people who are hospitalised with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the U.S. have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions must be taken to minimise the risk of virus transmission, especially in healthcare settings when performing procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne precautions.The CDC outlines the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended gear is: PPE gown, respirator or facemask, eye protection, and medical gloves.When available, respirators (instead of facemasks) are preferred.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial settings but the FDA has authorised the masks for use under an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
They are designed to protect from airborne particles like dust but effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for off-label uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19 related respiratory failure is being actively studied for people in hospital, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure.
Whether either of these two leads to the same benefit for people who are critically ill is not known.
Some doctors prefer staying with invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to a high flow nasal cannula.Severe cases are most common in older adults (those older than 60 years, and especially those older than 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits a health system's capacity to handle a sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalisation.
One study in China found 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support of ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people in hospital with COVID-19 are eventually admitted to ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators capable of pressure control modes and high PEEP are needed to maximise oxygen delivery while minimising the risk of ventilator-associated lung injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.
Research into potential treatments started in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir appears to be the most promising.
Although new medications may take until 2021 to develop, several of the medications being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antiviral medication may be tried in people with severe disease.
The WHO recommended volunteers take part in trials of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments.The FDA has granted temporary authorisation to convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not undergone the clinical studies needed to show it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the disease outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect 'close contact' using surveillance data and therefore a potential risk of infection.
Every user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, it also alerts local health officials.Big data analytics on cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and people whom they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to track mobile phone data of people supposed to have coronavirus.
The measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect those who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia deployed facial recognition technology to detect quarantine breakers.
Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he has been informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are continuing to move around anyway".
German government conducted a 48 hours weekend hackathon with more than 42.000 participants.
Also the president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
Individuals may experience distress from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of the infection itself.
BBC quoted Rory O'Connor in saying, "Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and an economic downturn are a perfect storm to harm people's mental health and wellbeing."
The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk for severe infection with COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses, like SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is lacking.In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 may rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal clotting and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Clotting abnormalities, specifically an increase in prothrombin time, have been described in 6% of those admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while abnormal kidney function is seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people who present with COVID-19 demonstrate elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five being spent hospitalised.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median time of seven days between hospitalisation and death.
In a study of early cases, the median time from exhibiting initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a death rate of 2.8% while women had a death rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung picture resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was noted by elevated levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalised had preexisting conditions.Availability of medical resources and the socioeconomics of a region may also affect mortality.
Estimates of the mortality from the condition vary because of those regional differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.
The under-counting of mild cases can cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past can mean the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.Concerns have been raised about long-term sequelae of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a drop of 20% to 30% in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans suggested organ damage.
This may also lead to post-intensive care syndrome following recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown if past infection provides effective and long-term immunity in people who recover from the disease.
Immunity is seen as likely, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases in which recovery from COVID-19 have been followed by positive tests for coronavirus at a later date have been reported.
These cases are believed to be worsening of a lingering infection rather than re-infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and have an animal origin, through spillover infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1 December 2019.
Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8 December 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for deaths from lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region.Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percent of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percent of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not time bound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution.
While not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about how many people have been infected.
In the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600, 80 (1.7%) are already dead.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival festivals, and spread to younger people, causing a relatively lower mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been formally classified as such.
Furthermore, the German health system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as assessed from blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the gap between men and women closing only at 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for this sex-difference is not known, but genetic and behavioural factors could be a reason.
Sex-based immunological differences, lesser prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected individuals were men and 72% of those died with COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking sex-related data of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral illnesses like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, particularly nurses, are women, and they have a higher chance of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name had been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations for naming aimed at preventing stigmatisation.The virus that causes COVID-19 is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO additionally uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both the disease and virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as interim names for the virus and disease in accordance with 2015 guidance against using locations in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently required a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver in the timescale required, a local startup reverse-engineered and printed the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and disinformation emerged regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and rapidly spread online.
Humans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No medications or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines in COVID-19 are underway by government organisations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to assess treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promise of efficacy.
There is no available vaccine, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being utilised because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, be it inactive or dead, aims to elicit a prompt immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a novel technique for creating a vaccination).
Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody dependent enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge for vaccine development for SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials were evaluating already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Repurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the Chinese research, with nine phase III trials on remdesivir across several countries due to report by the end of April.
A dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates was in place, as of April 2020.Several existing antiviral medications are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There is tentative evidence for efficacy by remdesivir, as of March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate-use remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese Health Authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that twice that dose is highly dangerous and could be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19.The Chinese 7th edition guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further in vivo study after demonstrating low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.Studies have demonstrated that initial spike protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from embracing these therapies without further study.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in COVID-19 treatment.
Cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties.Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by China's National Health Commission after a small study was completed.
It is undergoing a phase 2 non randomised test at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is meant to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies for treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomised, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an efficacious treatment for CRS.
Transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunisation.
This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralisation is the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
Production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from recovered patients and contains antibodies specific to this virus, could be increased for quicker deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Central Hospital of Wuhan, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
He told the doctor to test his covid.
He lost his life in the morning."
A small child can't tell you how he or she feels.
Lucas had many problems.
They provide information and advice to those who ignore the serious symptoms.
These figures appear to be low due to the lack of corona testing.
What is MIS-C?
As per the decision taken last week, all the shops in the state except the essential services shops were kept closed till April 30.
Fear can arise in the mind, oppression can come, many thoughts can come in the mind.
Exercise is essential for immunity.
Negative news, negative messages, or unsolicited advice from the church should be avoided. "
But it is equally important that you take care that you do not mistreat corona patients out of fear.
This condition is not deliberately, happily, taken away from you by this person.
It is important to talk to this person.
If the corona is not apprehended, strict restrictions will have to be imposed in the next 2 days.
Now, if the lockdown starts, I won't even have enough money to eat and drink.
As a result, they have no money left to go to the village.
Now, if there is a lockdown, what to eat and where to pay the room rent?
Their work has been shut down due to the possibility of a lockdown.
We don't want that to happen this time.
However, the corona virus will not go away, warned World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyes.
So far, 13.65 crore people in the world have been infected with carotenoids and more than 29 lakh people have been killed by corona.
And in some countries in the Middle East, the corona has re-emerged.
However, it cannot be said that this weapon will defeat the corona's companion."
Surveillance, contact tracing, isolation and sensible care can help prevent the disease and save lives, he said. Said.
As a result, the incidence is increasing rapidly and people's lives are being lost.
Some people think we are young and it doesn't matter if we get corona, he said.
Countries that are interested in producing corona vaccines can seek the help of the World Health Organization, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyes.
19 of them died after vaccination.
There is also no shortage of vaccines, the MHRA said.
Ask anyone who walks around wearing a mask in a campaign, a road-show, that's the answer most people get.
The battle against Corona will be fought after two May."
These statements show that some people are still not ready to take notice of the growing threat of corona in West Bengal.
At the same time, the number of corona victims is increasing day by day.
Eight-stage voting could be costly against the backdrop of corona infection.
Thousands, millions of people are participating in campaigns and road-shows.
In such a scenario, voting in three or four phases would not have been appropriate.
BJP leaders do not attach much importance to Mamata's statement.
There is no serious situation in the state to stop elections.
However, the Covid-19 protocol must be followed by all."
Doctors have expressed concern over the violation of rules during the election campaign in West Bengal.
What can we do if the Prime Minister, Home Minister and Chief Minister are violating the Kovid-19 protocol?"
All political parties are holding rallies in front of thousands of people without wearing masks and following the rules of social discrimination."
The state has also seen a sharp rise in the incidence of corona infections.
So, in other states, voting took place on April six.
The number of corona victims in the state has risen to 683.
Looking at the April figures, the number of corona patients in the state is increasing.
On Tuesday, 3645 new coronavirus patients were registered in Tamil Nadu.
Of these, 360 cases were found in Kolikod and 316 in Corona-bound Ernakulam.
Social discrimination was not observed at these rallies."
Corona infection is no longer a priority for politicians and the government in this power struggle.
Experts are of the view that corona infection has increased in the states since the Assembly elections were declared.
It took two months for the number of patients to increase tenfold.
People walking in the election campaign without masks and crowds are the main reasons for the rapid spread of corona infection."
It is not possible to follow the corona rules in the crowd during the campaign.
The Corona Protocol should have been followed properly.
If that doesn't happen, the situation will get out of hand.
We are also conducting awareness campaigns, said Shubhankar Sinha, joint commissioner of Kolkata police.
Rahul Gandhi's meetings were scheduled for the remaining phases there.
I also appeal to the leaders of other parties to consider the serious consequences of holding meetings in this situation."
They held their first meeting on April 14 for the fifth phase.
Voting for three more phases is pending.
On the same day, Modi will hold meetings in Malda and Murshidabad.
The commission ordered that the election campaign be closed at 7 pm instead of continuing till 10 pm.
Now the rest of the campaign will have to end 72 hours before the polls.
But it is a coincidence that the side effects of the vaccine are not yet clear.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Medicines Agency have also confirmed this.
Other complaints of blood clots were also found in 8 people.
The European Medicines Agency said earlier this week that "although this has not been proven, it is possible."
Either way the clots formed in the blood, the number of platelets decreased is a matter.
There is an urgent need for more research, said Prof. Dr. Krishna Kumar of the ULC Institute of Neurology.
A total of 1 crore people have been vaccinated against Pfizer so far.
It is estimated that 2 to 16 out of every 10 million people suffer from this condition every year.
31 of them developed CVST blood clots.
But it is estimated that people of different ages have this problem.
However, the researchers said that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks, and that there is a greater risk of not getting vaccinated.
According to statistics, one in 2.5 million people who have been vaccinated has died.
If the same people were 40 years old, 2,500 people would be killed.
This statistic is being studied all over the world.
Now everyone over the age of 45 is vaccinated.
The platform can be used by vaccination campaigns, vaccinating healthcare providers and vaccinators.
In addition, registration for the vaccine can be done through this app or through the Co-Win website.
This mobile app will also record statistics about vaccinations.
Covin's full name is written on the official website Co-WIN: Winning over COVID 19.
Make sure that the app you are downloading is an app brought by the Government of India, then download it.
But now everyone can register on this platform.
For this you have to enter Aadhar number, PAN number or other registered identity card.
When registering yourself, you have to scan and attach the credentials for electronic KYC.
Other identity cards will not be used at that time.
You will receive an OTP - One Time Password on this number.
Then select your district, city, ward or zip code.
Choose the slot that suits you and make sure.
Rear time tracking of vaccine doses can be done through this app.
Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, "With the help of this module, the officers will be able to create new sessions and those vaccination officers and managers will be informed about it."
It will also upload information on people with co-morbidities collected by local authorities.
In this, the information filled by the citizens can be seen by the officials.
And this will also affect the new variants of the vaccine Corona, tweeted Adar Poonawala, head of the Serum Institute.
The vaccine has also been tested on a new variant of the Kovid 19 found in Africa and the UK.
The original scientific name of this vaccine is NVX-CoV2373.
The Serum Institute has also entered into an agreement with Novavax to manufacture the vaccine.
The test will be conducted at 19 locations across the country, including Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, It will include Kerala, Punjab, Pondicherry, Odisha, Karnataka and West Bengal.
Kovishield is also exported to Europe.
Simply put, the genetic makeup of the corona virus has changed.
According to experts, "this could provide important information about where and how far the virus has spread."
Their health information is being collected.
Genome sequencing is the study of the genetic makeup of a virus.
The structure of the virus is identified by the nucleo tides A, T, G and C.
The genetic makeup changes constantly as the virus spreads.
The change in genome sequencing is more pronounced.
It can be identified after genome sequencing.
It can provide very important information.
Mutations in viruses are constantly occurring.
This changes the spike protein.
Genome sequencing is also done in laboratories like the National Institute of Virology in Pune.
This will be further increased after the new 'strain' found in Britain."
This information can be used for treatment purposes, he said.
One needs to do 'genome sequencing' to identify this.
Thousands of viruses have been sequenced so far.
If the patient is positive, his sample is sent for testing.
So will this new virus have any effect on the corona vaccine?
The vaccine produces antibodies in the body.
So now one to two people are more likely to be infected.
However, in the same month last year, she was working as a nurse in a care home in Goa.
Every time I look back, my heart beats faster."
She says that if she gets a salary, she will get only half of it.
He was constantly shouting at us saying follow the social distance.
However, before that, how many states and union territories in the country had declared lockdown?
The lockdown was implemented by the states according to the situation in their respective states.
We asked them if they had any idea before the lockdown was implemented or how they prepared their departments or territories to deal with the situation that would arise after the lockdown was implemented.
However, neither Minister Prakash Javadekar nor Secretary Amit Khare has yet agreed to the interview.
At that time, on 22 February 2020, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan declared, "India's strong health system is to prevent the corona virus from entering India."
Even then, the government showed great confidence.
However, most of our applications were forwarded to the Union Home Ministry or other departments.
This organization provides advice on all topics related to medical and public health.
Not only that, the department was not given a preconceived notion of a lockdown, the DGHS's Emergency Medical Relief (EMR) said.
It is the 'nodal agency for controlling and controlling infectious diseases'.
It is a fact that not everyone was present at those meetings.
This organization also forwarded our application to the Home Ministry.
However, given their knowledge and skills in enforcing the lockdown, they were consulted, and the organization did not have any evidence to show that.
Do you remember the quarantine facilities set up for Indians coming from abroad?
In April 2020, he found out that both his parents were positive.
Those who got calls did not know anything.
However, this time, saving the lives of every Indian is my top priority."
India's GDP fell by 24 per cent in the quarter under lockdown.
The Center for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE) estimates that the unemployment rate will reach 8.7 per cent in March 2020.
Executive Officer Mahesh Vyas says.
The proportion of people in the workforce has been steadily declining, from 42.7 per cent in 2016-17 to 41.6 per cent.
We wanted to know if the impact of the nationwide lockdown on the economy was discussed.
However, no evidence was given that any of these sections were discussed.
The organization also had no role in the nationwide lockdown.
However, it was set up on March 19, just five days before the lockdown.
We wanted to know how successful they were.
We do not have any information to show that we were involved in the lockdown decision in both the replies, he said.
There was no need for a nationwide lockdown.
It should have been a decentralized decision.
He said the government had released 63.07 lakh workers by train to their home states.
The BBC studied various media reports on the matter.
Were there any other suggestions to deal with the situation caused by the lockdown?
However, none of them had any idea about the lockdown.
The organization collected information on the plight of migrant workers and provided direct payments to about 40,000 workers.
But, you didn't prepare for such a big decision like lockdown.
If we had only prepared for 10 days, not so many lives would have been lost today. "
We asked for information on whether they had an idea before the lockdown was announced or whether they had discussed the consequences with the Prime Minister's Office.
The lockdown was announced the same day.
Asked if the lockdown was premeditated, the reply office said it was not known.
CDS heads the Department of Military Affairs under the Ministry of Defense.
people have been completely banned from leaving their homes
The Prime Minister said, "Personally, he is regularly monitoring all the preparations and measures."
We contacted key organizations, government departments, as well as state governments, which are directly involved in tackling the Kovid epidemic.
But so far, neither Minister Prakash Javadekar nor the ministry's secretary Amit Khare has given time for an interview.
How did this process go, especially when the key elements in the system were not aware of this decision?
India's strong healthcare system is able to prevent the corona virus from entering the country ."
Notably, the lockdown in most states was effective until March 31, 2020, while the national lockdown announced by the Prime Minister was originally for a staggering 3 weeks.
They did not shut down the whole country.
The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has issued a lockout order [No. 1-29 / 2020-PP (Pt.II)] removed.
The National Disaster Management Authority has decided to issue such orders to the Ministries / Departments of the Government of India, State Governments and State Authorities. "
The lockout was imposed accordingly.
Before issuing the above order, a complete list of public bodies / experts / individuals / government agencies / private entities and state government entities consulted by the National Disaster Management Authority should be obtained, the application said.
Information may be provided in the requested form, but the resources of the public body will have to be used in an unreasonable manner or the provision of such information will be an impediment to the security or preservation of the relevant records.
She says, "If you have to use a lot of time and resources in answering a request for information, then that information can be given in a different form, that is all that is stated in this section.
Eventually we were sent the same press release again.
These include the Prime Minister's Office, the Secretariat of the President, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the Ministry of Finance, as well as the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).
Many of these applications were transferred to the Ministry of Home Affairs by the concerned Ministries and Departments.
We have not been consulted before the lockdown, the ministry said.
The group announced important decisions to stop the entry of all international commercial passenger aircraft into India.
But the health ministry has not yet responded.
However, the secretariat did not say whether the corona virus outbreak or lockdown was discussed at the meetings.
Kumar, who has the status of a cabinet minister, said, "I don't think the lockdown was planned.
However, there must be accountability.
States can easily shirk responsibility and say they have no idea what they are doing."
He had recently said that there was a shortage of raw materials.
There is no solution yet, Poonawala said.
Oxford - AstraZeneca vaccine is available in India under the name Covishield.
These included Kovishield and Novavax, developed in the United States.
But at present, the production is at Rs 6-7 crore per month, it was learned after an inquiry.
The country is fearing another wave of covid.
The government aims to provide 60 crore doses over a period of seven months.
Bharat Biotech will also provide 1 crore doses of their vaccine.
The group will supply vaccines to low- and middle-income countries.
According to the United Nations, China has supplied 7.3 million doses of the vaccine to countries around the world.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has also rejected the claim that it has certified the effectiveness of Patanjali's covid treatment.
"You are the health minister.
The World Health Organization's Southeast Asia division said on Twitter,
This is the biggest increase in the last one year.
In September 2020, the highest number of 24,896 patients was found in a single day.
In the last 30 days, an average of 15,000 new patients are registered every day across India.
Of these, 23,179 new cases were registered on March 18 in Maharashtra alone.
Vaccination is also fast in Maharashtra.
But so far only 23 lakh vaccines have been given.
The Congress and the NCP have criticized the central government for giving to Pakistan and the world but not to the people of their own country.
Not only did it review the rising graph of corona in the country, but at the same time, many states are without vaccines, said Narendra Modi.
Most importantly, the vaccination campaign had not yet begun at that time.
A total of 29 million vaccines were given in the country till March 14, last week.
In a nutshell, Maharashtra has received 12 per cent of the total number of vaccinations till March 14.
We are doing everything we can to curb the corona.
We are concerned about the situation in Maharashtra.
There are some misconceptions and myths about corona vaccine in India.
Let's see in detail how true and how false these beliefs are.
But people have doubts about that too.
You will find detailed information about both of these vaccines at each vaccination center.
Replying to him, Harshvardhan says in his tweet,
Covid 19 disease does not cause impotence or infertility.
However, on the first day after vaccination, there may be a slight fever, swelling at the injection site, or pain in that area.
Since the vaccine is made by processing the corona virus, can it cause reverse covid 19 disease?
But, there is a possibility that it may have happened to you before you got vaccinated.
But, so it does not infect you with corona.
The virus was also found to be highly contagious.
This is followed by vaccination of citizens over 60 years of age and those with co-morbidities over 45 years of age.
After that, all those who need it will be vaccinated."
It has been sent to the state government and the central government.
However, a person should be given the same type of vaccine when giving two doses.
Vaccine tests have not been performed on pregnant women, so it is not known how they affect such women.
Such individuals may be considered fourteen days after the RTPCR test is negative.
There is also the question of which is true and which is false.
Against this backdrop, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today convened a meeting of the Chief Ministers of all the states through video conferencing.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi also advised to focus on small towns in particular.
In case of any illness, one should not only run away with the medicine but also take care after taking the medicine.
He said, "RTPCR tests should be increased so that new cases can be traced sooner.
Speaking to the Chief Minister, he said, "We should insist that the local administration should create a 'micro containment zone'.
The map shown at the beginning of the presentation shows that there are not enough vaccination centers in many areas or they are not active."
We want to make improvements using it.
However, that amount is not being produced.
Doses that come earlier should be used first and doses that arrive later should be used later."
The basic measures to prevent the spread of corona are to use a mask, observe physical distance, and observe hygiene.
If it needs to be strictly enforced, it must be done."
The Prime Minister said that the work done by India during this year is being discussed all over the world, setting an example for India.
India has one of the lowest mortality rates in the world. "
The confidence we have gained in Corona's fight should not be turned into overconfidence and this success should not be turned into irresponsibility.
One of the reasons we have succeeded in Corona is to save villages We have had success.
This is called a variant.
It can be identified from the chromosomal structure of the virus i.e. from genome sampling.
Production of this vaccine is ongoing.
It is an effective weapon.
The situation is almost the same in Uttar Pradesh.
As much as it succeeds, our goal of providing two doses of vaccine to health workers, frontline workers and others will be fulfilled."
The Prime Minister also suggested that the Pandemic Response Team working in the districts should be imparted new training on containment and surveillance.
He suggested that the most important thing is to find the contact chain of each infected person in the shortest possible time and keep the RTPCR tests above 70 per cent.
This is the picture in Kerala, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and UP.
The Prime Minister also suggested that all the states should provide complete information about the person who has undergone air travel and his / her contact chain and set up the necessary mechanism for the same.
But the WHO has appealed to these countries not to stop vaccination for covid 19.
And it is important to continue the vaccination campaign to prevent the virus from causing serious illness. "
Of those, less than 40 were diagnosed with blood clots, AstraZeneca said.
The German Ministry of Health has taken this step following the recommendation of the Paul Ehrlich Institute.
The German Ministry of Health has taken this step following the recommendation of the Paul Ehrlich Institute.
The response of citizens around the world to the vaccine is being recorded.
The organization says that vaccines can be given.
The government hopes the quarantine on the boat will help revive the sinking tourism business in Thailand.
The government expects the new initiative to bring Thailand 1.8 billion baht (58 58 million) in revenue.
But last year, an outbreak of the corona virus forced Thailand to restrict the number of tourists visiting the country.
According to this, tourists who get a negative test report will be quarantined on a boat or on a short cruise near Phuket.
It is estimated that about 100 boats will participate.
This band will be keeping an eye on their body symptoms.
But since October, they have opened their borders to tourists.
But everyone has a question - when will I get the vaccine?
It involves companies from many countries, governments around the world have made different statements about it, and regulatory bodies and officials of countries have a significant role to play in this process.
This included vaccinating healthcare workers and frontline workers.
Private vaccination centers are charging Rs 250 for each dose of vaccine.
This is the largest vaccination campaign to date in the history of the world.
But more countries are still waiting for the first batch of vaccine doses.
The number of hospital admissions and deaths has come down and so has the transmission of community transmission.
There is currently a good supply of vaccines in the UK and US.
But they do not seem to be getting priority delivery of vaccines.
But their decision seems to have gone wrong.
Some doses of the vaccine bound for Australia were withheld by Italy.
Russia and China are both struggling to make ends meet in Eastern Europe.
Countries that use both doses of Chinese cyanoform vaccines are likely to rely on China for further booster doses if needed in the future.
At present, 80% of the total vaccines given to them are cyanoform.
That is why China's influence will be long-term.
Due to the huge population and shortage of health workers in both the countries, vaccination in both the countries will take time.
The Serum Institute of India is Poonawala's largest vaccine manufacturer in the world.
But keeping everyone happy is the biggest challenge."
We're good at everything we do, but we don't have a magic wand.
Also, if a booster dose of the vaccine is needed for a newer variant of the corona, the same will apply.
The vaccine will also be supplied to Africa through the Covax scheme.
The aim is to provide affordable vaccines to every country in the world.
The rest of the countries will pay for it but they will get it at a relatively low rate by getting vaccinated through this scheme.
The Covax plan aims to supply 2 billion doses of the vaccine worldwide by the end of this year.
Despite the planned implementation of the scheme, it will vaccinate 20-27% of the country's population.
Vaccination may not be a priority for every country.
It will also cause a virus that does not respond to the vaccine.
But vaccinating 7.7 billion people worldwide is a major challenge and has never been done before.
It's very difficult for any government to say that we won't be able to reach out to everyone in the next few years, and no one wants to say that.
Most students have their own room here,
As soon as the lockdown was announced, we turned to online.
This includes students from Kashmir and other remote areas.
However, many parents say that this is only a temporary measure.
Both of my children regularly attend teaching classes at Zoom.
We are offering online courses to the students.
Social distance is an important issue and lessons can be learned from the manner in which educational institutions have been set up in Europe, South Korea and China.
Some have made it mandatory for students to check their temperature after entering the school building.
In addition to learning at school, there were friends, communication, lunch.
Her mother Radha Rajput told the BBC that Rani has been sitting alone in the house since the lockdown started.
My husband drives a rickshaw and I work as a maid.
We haven't received any instructions from my daughter's school since the lockdown started.
People in the field of education will have to make efforts to find other innovative options along with online education so that more and more students can learn.
12 lakh students from 8 states of India are using this app.
Also, if you are going to teach someone trigonometry without their ability, it is of no use, says Riteish.
Upgradation Up's slogan is 'Mera Mobile Mera Vidyalaya'.
Now they are teaching through TV in some states.
It has received a very good response, so now we are preparing syllabus for secondary school classes.
These include problems with the home environment and concentration.
But, so far we have only reached 30 students through this medium, says Chhaya Ben.
The parents of these girls do not have smartphones, nor do they pay special attention to girls' education.
He has established the International Public School of Rural Innovation in the state of Orissa.
So now the schools have to decide how to participate in it."
In this, students learn science based agriculture, entrepreneurship.
The way students learn sports and dance can be a big change.
He is trying to fill the digital divide by creating a network of his teachers.
We are sending video and audio tutorials.
Our teachers are learning how to use audio and video.
Anyway, it is a challenging task.
Only time will tell how the education sector will undergo a radical change during this period and how it will affect the students.
With the help of these spike proteins, viruses enter human cells.
The new variant can spread faster than the original virus, causing more serious illness or not being vaccinated.
The genome sequence of a virus found in a corona-infected patient's sample is used to check for changes in the virus.
Since then, more than one crore people in India have been infected.
This has not received much attention in India till now.
Therefore, it is feared that the new variant of the corona virus may be the cause of the outbreak.
The UK variant has been found in most of these patients.
Infection rates have risen in both the states.
Even though there are 14 million cases in the country, only 6400 genomes have been stored, he said.
They have been ordered to immediately report the samples by genome sequencing.
The fact that no such variant is spreading now does not mean that it will not happen in the future.
The government has allocated14 million to promote genome sequencing in India.
(In most of these samples, only one variant has been found and it is likely to have come to India from Europe.)
This means that the virus is changing faster than ever before, he said.
Each of these showed more than 11 mutations.
The process for this varies across the country.
In addition, the trained staff collects the samples, which are stored in special containers and then sent to various laboratories across the country.
However, if the genome sequencing of a sample of a person from abroad and in isolation is to be done, it has to be done quickly.
In a country like India where very little is spent on the health sector, they wonder whether there will be a system for sequencing.
But more important than that - vaccinating more people.
The number of coronaviruses and deaths is low.
This is the highest one-day figure in the country since the re-infection.
As many as 2,68,370 patients have died of corona in Brazil so far.
They consistently tried to reduce the risk posed by the virus.
This is the third highest number of patients registered in a single day.
It is believed to have originated in the city of Amazon.
The two cities, Porto Alegre and Campo Grande, have increased the capacity of the health system.
We were not in any trouble.
He turns one year old today.
We tried to learn from their experiences by talking to them.
The Corona storm had just begun to roar.
Suresh felt good with the medicine he gave.
This was the beginning of the battle against Corona.
The girl's report was positive and the boy's was negative.
Initially, the doctors were also checking from a distance.
Corona, isolation, remote screening and prescribing were all new to him.
But when we got the news on the phone, we started to get scared.
This helped them to reduce their fears as well.
He was released after reports came back negative.
We stayed in home isolation for the next month.
I first donated plasma when the system for plasma was introduced in Sassoon.
All this has given us a new positive outlook on life.
The menstrual pattern changed completely.
Rashmi, gave a successful fight against Corona.
He remembers every day of the first menstrual period after being freed from the corona.
But, those days were different than normal days, she says.
But, the date after covid came much earlier.
I remember 2-3 months when, due to a lot of bleeding, I had to stop standing, my torso could not sit still, I had to hug my abdomen.
Not Corona, but she is feeling the side effects.
So we tried to find out from gynecologists, does covid change women's menstrual cycle?
So did Kovid change the shift?
This is not a disease.
There is still no evidence to show that corona infection affects menstruation."
That's what Dr. Fortis Hospital.
So the menstrual cycle will gradually return to normal, he said.
Eating and drinking times changed as they worked from home.
The drug, called Coronil, was recently launched in the presence of some government ministers.
However, various claims are being made regarding the approval of this drug.
The drug is being sold by Patanjali, a large company in India.
The famous yoga guru Baba Ramdev promoted this medicine as a 'cure' for corona.
The central government said there was no evidence that the drug could cure corona.
Union Health Minister Dr. Harshvardhan was present.
The association took a stand to make this clear.
It is based on periodic laboratory tests.
Therefore, there is no evidence that this drug can cure corona virus in humans.
Of those, 45 were treated and 50 were part of the placebo group (which was not given).
The company also clarified that this was done only to experiment at the primary level.
This is because treatment can vary for many other reasons.
The company says the certificate is in line with World Health Organization (WHO) certification plans.
This certificate is issued for the purpose of export to ensure production standards.
It is only to maintain quality standards during production."
The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare informed about this .
The state government has been given the freedom to decide in this regard.
Also, public sector units can be used as covid vaccination centers
The Government of India has allocated Rs 35,000 crore in the budget for this nationwide vaccination campaign.
There are 27 crore such people in India.
All of them are said to be in the range of Rs 80 lakh to Rs 1 crore.
Health workers are classified into nine groups for vaccination.
The number of vaccination centers will be increased to 50, he added.
Cooper Hospital is a vaccination center.
After the state level steering committee, there is a state action force, state control room, district action force at district level, district control room, taluka action force at taluka level and taluka control room.
From there, the vaccine will be shipped to 37 state-run stores.
These instructions to the states state the use of technology.
The Center has said that measures need to be taken for this.
If the relevant vaccination center has a waiting room, observation center, seating capacity for large number of people, as well as large luggage storage, another vaccination officer will be deployed there.
From there, the vaccine will be shipped to 37 state-run stores.
For this, Mumbai Municipal Corporation has set up a 5000 square feet vaccination center in Kanjurmarg.
A large number of anti-corona vaccines can be stored here, said Suresh Kakani, chief additional commissioner of the vaccination task force.
The vaccine will be kept in Ice-Lined Refrigerators (ILR) at the hospital. "
The hospital's Ice-Lined Refrigerators (ILRs) will store the Covid-19 vaccine in the fridge.
They will be used to find people of different ages and register them on the digital platform Co-WIN.
The Center has issued instructions to all states to allow them to stay there for half an hour after vaccination and to monitor and vaccinate only one person at a time.
But there are some fake apps with the same name.
It is also said that the link to download this app will be sent by the government all over the country.
That's why ordinary citizens can't download or register on this app.
When registering yourself, you have to scan and attach the credentials for electronic KYC.
Other identity cards will not be used at that time.
At the same time, the Drug Controller General has authorized clinical trials of the vaccine on teenagers under the age of 18.
Also, the rules of social distance must be followed.
But, is this vaccine effective, efficient and safe to use?
The vaccine is safe and boosts the immune system, the Lancet said.
The vaccine is being developed jointly by the Indian Council of Medical Research and Bharat Biotech.
However, experts have raised questions on this.
This question has been raised by India Drug Action Network.
Transparency is important to build trust in people about the vaccine.
Tests on monkeys have shown that the covacin vaccine can protect against the virus."
What if you lost contact with the outside world for 14 days?
The number of coronavirus infections is on the rise.
She was one of the first patients in the country to be infected with the virus.
In addition, there is a safe box that opens from both sides.
The other day we don't pay much attention to how we breathe, how our lungs are working.
Closing your contact with everyone else for a while.
Which means forty.
People living with a patient with an infectious disease are most likely to get the disease.
It is clear that a person within 6 feet can be infected if they have symptoms of corona virus.
But if someone is in trouble, they can take care of it at home.
Whose door is closed, but you can keep the windows open.
Not even your family.
Also make sure you don't use anyone else's towel.
Although quarantine is said to prevent the spread of any contagious disease, it can have an adverse effect on the mind of the person concerned.
Corona's panic has caused many to fear him.
Preferably alone, if there is a family member, he needs to keep a distance of up to 1 meter.
Then burn it or proof, the used mask can be infected.
Clean their room, toilet with bleach solution or phenolic solution.
Don't forget that the mask is your shield in the battle of Corona, said Uddhav Thackeray.
The work given by the Chief Minister should be done in a quality manner.
MP Sambhaji Raje Chhatrapati had expressed his displeasure over this.
Purity should be maintained.
I am grateful to him for that."
During these two days, 24 hours access will be given to Raigad.
The other instructions of the government are as follows ...
Instead, arrangements should be made to make the program available on cable network or online.
Instead, a wreath-laying ceremony should be organized for the statue or image of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.
It should create awareness about diseases like corona, malaria, dengue etc., and their preventive measures as well as hygiene.
He also wrote, "Salutations to Shivaji Maharaj on his birthday.
Every day 400 children participated in this educational program.
The outbreak continued for almost a year and infected 3,502 people.
As a result, he developed a strong immune system, and as a result, he did not show any symptoms compared to other children, and he did not see any health problems.
As a result, people inadvertently spread the virus through their bodies.
One is the so-called 'effective' immunity, which can prevent the disease from getting worse
It can also prevent asymptomatic illnesses.
There are several types of vaccines available for the disease caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis.
When a person sneezes, coughs, kisses or smokes a cigarette, it spreads to others.
He adds, "Very few infected people have germs because they have the immune system."
Disinfection immunity is the next thing.
It has been seen whether these vaccines can prevent the development of symptoms rather than testing such capabilities.
He is Professor of Immunology at Imperial College London.
About 66 percent of them were asymptomatic.
But it's very difficult, says Altman.
One way to do this is to reduce the number of toxins in people's bodies.
One is lockdown and the other is vaccine.
To avoid any confusion, this information does not include any information on protection from symptoms or protection.
The lungs of these monkeys are similar to those of humans.
However, the symptoms of the disease may decrease.
Looking at the tests in the third phase, the picture was more complex.
Of those who were given two full doses, the same percentage dropped to four.
However, further statistics were needed to confirm this.
Statistics show that a single dose is reduced by 67 percent for those who are able to detect the virus.
However, there are some early signs that the vaccine may help prevent infection.
However, this has not yet been proven in human trials.
The other 98% had more antibodies than those infected with corona.
This is because either the size of the samples is small and has not even been published in a reputed journal.
Out of 1,63,000 people, only 31 became infected.
Of these, 14 people tested positive after the first dose, while 38 of those who took placebo tested positive.
However, this research had some limitations.
Also, like other vaccines, this vaccine has not yet shown widespread ability to prevent infection.
So it is seen as promising.
Head is a Senior Research Fellow in Global Health at the University of Southampton.
Of course, this involves many things.
However, if the vaccine is 80 percent effective, then 75 and 90 percent of people need immunity.
The UK aims to make all adults immune by September.
Therefore, the goal is to reduce corona infection as much as possible.
That is, pregnant women, children, sick people can be included.
Even if you are vaccinated, you should act as if you have not been vaccinated and be careful.
Urgent decisions have also been taken to increase the production of essential items like masks.
States will now have a policy of deciding on a national solution or procedure rather than making decisions for themselves.
So far, 2.45 million Americans have been infected with the corona.
He said the number of coyote victims in the United States is expected to reach 5 million by next month.
He said more Americans died during the outbreak than during World War II.
Some local officials had said that the supply of vaccines was being disrupted and stocks of vaccines were running out in some places.
These range from better delivery of the vaccine to the provision of appropriate corona tests.
However, funding for the plans he announced will come from a 1. 1.9 trillion aid package announced by Biden last week.
The United States will participate in the Covax scheme to provide covid vaccine to poor countries. Fauchi said.
But some Marathi speakers living abroad have already received a dose of the vaccine.
Only after registering first can you go to the destination to get vaccinated.
We spoke to three doctors living in the USA, the UK and Germany.
His work did not stop when Kovid's company spread.
She says, "No matter what injection I took, it was expected to hurt or get worse on the first day.
I had no fever, nausea, or chills.
I took the vaccine and I had some side effects, but the CDC knows about it.
There were restrictions on many things.
Getting the vaccine doesn't mean you won't get sick.
He has received fellowships in this field, which is why he is currently in the UK and working there.
Ashutosh did not feel much discomfort that day after taking the first dose of the vaccine.
This second wave was expected.
So there was a lockdown, which was extended to January 31, he said.
"I was in the emergency department.
At such times you have an increased risk of infection.
Previously, vaccinations were given directly to doctors working in the ICU or to doctors who came in contact with emergency patients.
Amay received a dose of Pfizer Bioentech vaccine on January 1.
Like any other injection, they injected the needle with a needle.
If the vaccine is 70 per cent or 90 per cent effective, it means you have a 70 per cent or 90 per cent less chance of getting codified.
The growing number of patients and the shortage of beds also raised questions about Pune's healthcare system.
The number of corona patients in Pune is declining and now only 2678 patients are undergoing treatment.
Journalist Pandurang Raikar also died at the Jumbo Covid Center in COEP due to untimely treatment.
On September 7, 2,053 new coronavirus patients were found in Pune.
The centers were set up at COEP ground and Magar College ground in Pimpri.
According to the Pune Municipal Corporation, 202 new patients were found on January 7.
This year this Ganeshotsav was celebrated very simply.
Citizens have responded positively to the government's call from time to time, which has resulted in a reduction in the number of patients, observers have reported.
A fine of Rs 500 is levied accordingly.
This action had a positive effect.
Accordingly, emphasis was laid on increasing the number of tests in Pune as well.
This number appeared to have decreased in the medium term.
Assistant Health Officer of Pune Municipal Corporation Dr. Sanjeev Wavre says, "Citizens were heavily involved in preventing Corona.
Decreased infectivity of corona virus is also likely to reduce the number of patients.
On December 30, BBC Marathi had a conversation with Mayor Murlidhar Mohol about this.
Health workers, frontline workers will be given priority in the vaccination program.
Kovachield of Serum Institute of India and Kovacin of Bharat Biotech were then allowed for emergency use.
Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech's anti-covid-19 vaccine was allowed for emergency use.
Along with the Congress, a large section of the country questioned whether the vaccine was effective.
Yet why was the use of this vaccine allowed in the country? Such a question was presented.
How the vaccine will be given was monitored
Preeti Kumar says, 'Everyone except children should get this vaccine.
The vaccine will be given first to emergency service personnel.
Doses will be given according to the availability of the vaccine.
Vaccination centers will be set up.
This investigation is still pending.
Symptoms include a slight fever, swelling, or headache after vaccination.
Once the corona is infected, its severity will decrease.
In particular, covacin.
The second dose will be given 21 to 28 days after the first dose.
Will those who have passed corona be vaccinated?
However, due to the low availability of the vaccine in the current situation, people who have been corona-free are more likely to be vaccinated after some time.
But, we still don’t know how long the immune system will last in a corona infection.
Therefore, such persons are in no hurry to get vaccinated.
But, the sooner this dose is taken, the better.
Therefore, both doses should be of the same vaccine.
Emergency use is permitted for persons over 18 years of age and non-pregnant women.
Therefore, these patients will be vaccinated.
The vaccine will be given only to adults.
But, according to the doctor, these symptoms are not very serious.
Similar side effects have been reported in other vaccines.
The government is trying to reach out to the people and persuade them.
Cold temperatures are needed to store them.
This is because the vaccine can be refrigerated.
At present the Oxford vaccine will be used.
Even after vaccination, it will be important to wear a mask and observe social distance.
Masks and social distance will continue for about a year and a half.
Preparations are underway to vaccinate 30 crore people in the next 6 to 7 months.
One million people have been vaccinated in Russia since September.
The goal is to vaccinate 100 million people in the United States by April.
With the help of these doses, 2 crore people can be vaccinated.
This involves using a specific small portion of the virus's genetic code to make a vaccine.
But RNA vaccines developed on other diseases were given to people during some trials.
It found 90% protection in seven days after taking the second dose.
Adar Punawala, owner and CEO of Siram Institute of India, said on Twitter that he had applied for permission.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had recently visited the Serum Institute in Pune to inspect the vaccine work.
At the same time, the Serum Institute will prepare an additional 10 crore doses.
This is the second vaccine to be approved in the United States.
Many have not yet been infected, and the death toll has not yet risen due to restrictions imposed or already imposed in various countries.
This will prevent the corona virus from becoming infected or causing serious side effects.
He had made it clear that 30 crore people would be vaccinated from August to September.
Harsh Vardhan had said that the task force set up by the Indian government was also holding discussions with other pharmaceutical companies.
I want to clarify this, said Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan on December 1.
After that, there is no need to vaccinate the entire population, said ICMR Director General Dr. Balram Bhargava said.
Along with the serum vaccine, Prime Minister Modi also inspected the work of these vaccines.
The vaccine is being tested on 26,000 volunteers in 22 cities across India.
Extremely small amounts of viruses or bacteria are released into the body.
Its genetic code is available and is yet to be tested.
Given the current state of the world caused by the corona virus, 60 to 70 percent of the world's population needs a vaccine to boost their immune system.
The vaccine will first be administered to doctors and health workers treating Covid-19 patients.
Also, those who care for the elderly will need to be vaccinated.
But hygiene is the most important thing to protect against corona virus.
In addition, it is necessary to take immediate steps after the onset of symptoms and follow the instructions to be isolated or quarantined.
An exact replica of this virus cannot be created.
According to Bharat Biotech, 375 volunteers have been tested in the first phase and 380 in the second phase.
People with chronic illnesses are also included in the test.
Safety information has been provided to the Drug Controller General.
Its safety and efficiency are recognized in India and around the world.
It was found that after vaccination, the immune system increased.
The immune system will respond and attack the virus.
We tried to find out how the committee recommended approval.
However, the effectiveness of the vaccine remains to be seen.
The committee said the vaccine was found to be safe and effective.
Are there any side effects?
It is studied whether the body produces antibodies against the corona after vaccination.
But, in the current situation, if the effect of the vaccine is better than 50 per cent, it has to be said to be effective.
Less than 30 per cent effective vaccine cannot boost immunity.

The corona vaccine will be given to people in emergency care for the first time.
Therefore, the government should make public the effectiveness of the vaccine as soon as possible, he said. Gilada said.
For this, it should have been approved in the clinical stage.
Two vaccines on corona have been approved for emergency use by the Government of India's Drug Control Agency (DCGI).
Kovachield of Serum Institute of India and Kovacin of Bharat Biotech were then allowed for emergency use.
Other vaccines are safe - as safe as water.
After that, the managing director of Bharat Biotech, Dr. Krishna Ila came forward and gave an explanation.
If I am wrong, tell me.
Also, India Biotech and Serum Institute will issue a joint statement, he said.
Therefore, the focus now is on production, supply and distribution, he said.
She was arrested for protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act.
However, Safura had to stay in the overcrowded Tihar Jail for two months.
They used to tell other prisoners not to talk to me.
Strict lockdowns were imposed in India at that time, just as lockdowns were imposed in many countries due to the Corona health crisis.
Not only in India, but social activists say that governments in many Asian countries have used the corona virus as a shield to enforce the law, many have been arrested and controversial schemes have been hatched.
During an epidemic, tracking was used for contact tracing.
Human rights activists from 16 countries have faced lawsuits.
Five special UN spokesmen expressed concern over the arrests.
Resistance is negligible.
The government has always denied the allegations in the wake of the arrests.
But more than 400 people, including Nole, who appeared before the media as a communist leader, were similarly accused.
In addition, Zara Alvarez and Randall Akenis were attacked and killed.
Despite this, the popularity of President Rodrigo Duterte still remains.
These websites criticizing the government were shut down in the name of spreading 'misinformation' about Kovid-19.
Concerns have been raised about how civilians were unnecessarily targeted and severely persecuted.
But we will never know if this can happen without it.
At that time, the agitation was not taking place due to the health crisis in Corona.
However, the ICJ has expressed concern that their use could continue even after the epidemic is over.
Over the last few days, it has been observed that passengers arrive at Maharashtra by landing at airports in other states.
It is being traced who they came in contact with, informed the Principal Secretary of Health, Dr. Pradeep Vyas in a meeting at Varsha.
Following the news, the World Health Organization (WHO) held in-depth discussions with the UK Government.
In such a situation, the question was whether the difference in this new species of corona would affect him.
The vaccine, developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca in the UK, is manufactured in India by the Serum Institute Covishield.
And as expected, the Serum Institute's vaccine was approved.
Such an objection is being taken.
The Oxford vaccine is said to be 70 percent effective.
But there are relatively few objections to Covishield due to statistics from Oxford vaccine trials elsewhere around the world.
The permission is given ahead of time and it can be dangerous.
Congress leader Jairam Ramesh and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav also expressed concern over the use of covacin.
It's the responsibility of the government and the regulators to be transparent about the statistics.
The scientific process has been followed while allowing the vaccine of Mr. Shashi Tharoor, Mr. Akhilesh Yadav and Mr. Jairam Ramesh, Kovid-19, don't discredit it.
Permission granted for covacin is completely different from covachield because it will be used while in clinical trials.
The test has been completed and follow-up of the patients is underway.
The vaccine is safe for people.
There is swelling or pain when the vaccine is given.
Our goal is to reach the population most in need of it.
Two doses of the vaccine have been shown to be more than 60 percent effective, according to Reuters.
If vaccination needs a backup, then what does it mean?"
Although the Covishield vaccine is manufactured in India, the original vaccine was developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca.
Only then will approval be given, said Somani.
Poonawala has clarified that the serum vaccine will be given to the government at Rs 200 and to the public at Rs 1,000 .
He said the covachield vaccine has an overall effectiveness of 70 per cent, while the covacin is an indigenous vaccine that is safe and will help boost the immune system.
Vaccines manufactured by various companies on the corona are currently in the final stages.
After that, the citizens will be monitored for half an hour to see if they are affected by the vaccine."
The system is called Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network System (Co-Win).
Priority will be given for that.
The Center has said that measures need to be taken for this.
But don't be discouraged.
The progress of vaccination and the formulation of appropriate strategies to address the challenges have been suggested.
The Center also said that the direction of the campaign and providing proper information is also a big challenge.
People will also be concerned about giving without vaccine tests.
If the relevant vaccination center has a waiting room, observation center, seating capacity for large number of people, as well as large luggage storage, another vaccination officer will be deployed there.
After this, people under the age of 50 but suffering from other diseases will be vaccinated.
It will have separate groups of people over 60 years of age and 50 to 60 years of age.
For this, any of the 12 identity cards like voting card, Aadhar card, vehicle license, passport, PAN card can be used.
With that in mind, the pre-Corona world until 2019 and the post-Corona world from 2020 can be calculated separately.
Here's a brief overview of how the years went by as a journalist talking about the Corona virus and personally experiencing Covid.
The 'thumbrule' of working in a digital medium is adaptation.
For new parents like me, this 'work from home' of 2020 has fallen on the 'new normal' path.
Politics, economics, crime, health, there are many different areas that are different 'beats'.
If the office bearers had not understood about the household responsibilities and the commitment of the office, no employee would have survived this year.
On the other hand, the innumerable claims about the virus and the disease through social media were suffocating the saying 'water on pet peeves'.
Many who did not come out of their coffers became aware of their surroundings, were inspired to help others, and many acted on it to build a great bridge of humanity.
There was no cure if Corona came near you, but you were told not to go after him.
The young and old coward in the house went positive and then the quarantine chapter started.
Experiencing the 'covid exclusive' symptoms of taste and odor, one day we asked 'What's new today?'
Although we are counted in the total number of covid patients in the country, we are not counted in the government offices in Delhi where we live.
Any virus enters the body.
What a story of meeting new places and meeting new people where family visits did not take place and it was not possible to go to your own home all year round.
2020 also taught a lot.
But should this statement of Prime Minister Modi be considered as an important sign about Lashi?
The vaccines mentioned above can be stored at this temperature, so any vaccine that meets the safety and efficacy criteria can be considered approved.
This time he was talking.
Modi has said that the people of the country will get the vaccine produced in India.
Next year, our country will implement the largest vaccination program in the world.
With 14 more patients found in India, the number of people affected by this new strain has now reached 20.
But the new strain is not necessarily more dangerous, experts say.
India has the second highest number of corona patients in the world after the United States.
This is where the new strain is found to be infected.
Of these, 114 passengers were found to be infected with corona.
So far, new strains of corona have been found in Canada, Japan, Spain, Sweden and France.
Experts say the vaccine will be effective.
These doses are enough to vaccinate 50 million people.
The vaccine was first tested on a volunteer in April, after which clinical trials of the vaccine began.
The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has since been approved.
She was the first person to be vaccinated against coronavirus.
Ultra cold storage is required to store Pfizer-BioTech vaccines.
This process takes time for the immune system to develop against the virus.
It became an integral part of the now-developed vaccine.
Sometimes it is caused by Zika virus and sometimes it is caused by flu.
This builds up immunity.
A virus entered the human body and then the modern world saw the threat of death.
Companions of the deadly virus were also terrified, but still some areas were able to stay away from them.
The economic cycle stopped and he too died.
One is whether the number of deaths due to corona virus, due to medical reasons, is higher this year?
Daily numbers began to go into a few thousand homes.
The answer is no.
In it, he cites statistics from the Oxford University's Martin School's Our World in Data project on total human deaths in 2017 and its various causes.
The highest number of deaths were due to heart disease and the number was 48742 per day.
These figures are for each day and there are other reasons besides the ones cited here.
According to him, the first 10 important reasons for the total death of 5.54 crore people in 2019 have been given.
The most important reason in this survey is that 7 out of the first 10 causes are non-communicable diseases.
Heart disease is still the leading cause of death in the world, with the number of deaths rising from 20 million to 89 million between 2000 and 2019.
As of December 27, 2020, 17,51,311 deaths worldwide have been caused by Covid-19, according to the WHO on its website.
The impact of this crisis is unprecedented and huge, given the Corona infection, the resulting daily deaths, the lack of modern medical treatment, the resulting worldwide lockdowns and the resulting massive economic losses.
Is this the highest number of deaths in a short period of time for a specific reason in human history?
When we compare the Corona period with that period, we realize that an even more terrible time has come.
It will be necessary to compare this year with 2020 because even in that year, the world was facing an unprecedented medical challenge.
The exact number of deaths is not a single figure, but it is estimated that between 5 and 10 million people worldwide have been killed.
However, looking at the numbers then and today, it can be said that we have been able to save many lives today.
That destruction of wealth and lives is destructive.
The war lasted for six years, but it spread to most parts of the world, killing hundreds of soldiers and civilians every day.
About 5 to 6 crore soldiers and civilians were killed in this war.
The horrific memories of this British-era drought are still alive in India today.
Drought was a natural disaster, but at the same time the policies of the then British government were said to have caused these deaths.
But this disaster took the lives of millions.
One such period we are currently witnessing.
'Zhan has been convicted of creating unrest and tension.
He was often oppressed by the government.
Why couldn't I do it?
Because this country can't go back now.
The next day, he was arrested by Shanghai police.
The indictment alleges that he spread false information through WeChat, Twitter and YouTube, as well as other media.
He was also recommended to be sentenced to four or five years.
They were suffering from headaches, stomach aches and wheezing.
They would constantly change cousins ​​even in their sleep, Zhang's lawyer said.
Zhang was arrested for supporting the movement in Hong Kong.
The Chinese government is trying its best to suppress their voices.
Shane is said to be living with his family and is being monitored by government agencies.
Efforts are being made at all levels to make the tests faster and more comprehensive.
Similar to a pregnancy test, the results of this test can be seen immediately.
The protagonist of the famous director Satyajit Ray's spy story has been named in the test kit - 'Feluda.'
This will be the world's first test of the Covid-19 using paper.
These tests are also being done in some private labs.
The accuracy of the test is based on these two criteria.
Commercial use of this test has been approved by drug regulators.
India has become the second largest country in the world in terms of number of patients.
These tests are of two types.
It involves the study of the genetic material of a virus in a laboratory using chemicals.
This involves taking a blood sample from a finger and examining the symptoms of a previous infection.
Because it is relatively inexpensive and more accurate.
It can be tested even in small labs without state-of-the-art equipment, said IGIB Director Dr. Anurag Agarwal told the BBC.
This means that a swab will be taken through the nose for this test as well.
There are different processes to check the amount of toxins.
This is an acronym for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats.
That is, we move the cursor there to correct a wrong word and then remove the wrong letter and type the correct letter there.
Feluda is an important step in that direction, said Dr. Stephen Kisler, a research fellow at Harvard Medical School.
The first wave was a time-consuming and labor-intensive PCR test, while the second phase was an antigen test, said Dr. Harvard Global Health Institute.
Feluda is a very important step in that regard, said Dr. Harvard, a research fellow at Harvard Medical School.
One of them is a paper strip developed by Sherlock Biosciences. 
This test will be simple, affordable," said Dr. Chakraborty said.
Now a new strain of the corona virus (a new strain of the virus) has been found in South Africa.
This information was given by the British Health Minister Matt Hancock.
Quarantine instructions have also been issued to those who have returned from South Africa in the last 15 days and come in contact with such people.
The mutated corona virus has a transmissibility of 70%.
The mutations in both are different."
We know more about the new strain found in Britain, because we are studying it more closely.
This means that the vaccine will be effective, she said.
The vaccine works extensively and is also effective against different types of the same virus."
This is the new species found in London.
This information was given by the deputy health officer of the city, Antonio Japatero.
But no patient is serious and there is no need to panic, Japatero said.
They may have been infected with a new corona species.
The infected person has no symptoms and is currently isolated at home.
But citizens are required to show their corona negative report before traveling.
Three of them are British nationals, both of whom had gone to Switzerland for the Christmas holidays, the administration said.
This is why thousands of British citizens have flocked to Switzerland in the past few weeks.
A man returning from Britain is in critical condition.
But this is only an estimate."
It has a mutation called N501Y.
Saudi Arabia, Oman and Kuwait have closed their borders for a week.
They have restricted the entry of all British citizens until the end of January.
This strain is a little different than the strain of Britain.
A new strain of corona virus has been found.
This new type of virus spreads 70 percent faster and is therefore called a 'super spreader'.
At a press conference in Delhi, he spoke about the mutated corona virus.
This is called a mutation.
The number of active corona victims on Tuesday was - 2,92,518.
The virus can still be controlled with caution.
The virus is said to have a 70% infectious ability.
It has not affected the mortality rate or the rate of hospitalization.
Of these, N501Y has increased the virus's ability to infect human cells.
We have excellent laboratories and we are studying the genetic makeup of thousands of viruses.
He also said that genetic sequencing of samples coming to the laboratory has been started from Monday.
Samples of any of these corona positive will be taken and genetically sequenced.
Will the vaccines that have been developed so far be effective against the modified form of the virus?
Mutations in the virus have not changed the method of treatment and guidelines.
But the World Health Organization says there is no reason to fear the new virus and that the situation is under control.
Some have suspended flights.
Railway traffic through the Channel Tunnel has also been blocked.
It will be implemented from December 22.
According to health officials, the virus has a transmission rate of 70 percent.
The vaccine, which is being tested in the UK, could be discussed at the meeting.
This includes lorries.
This traffic will be closed until January 1.
Ireland is urged not to travel by air or sea.
Freight is underway.
Belgium has suspended air links to the UK as well as rail services.
Prior to that, people coming to Austria from the UK would have to stay in quarantine for ten days.
By mid-December, it has infected two-thirds of people in the UK, according to the BBC's health and science correspondent James Gallagher.
According to the Union Ministry of Health, there are currently 9 lakh clinical trials in the country.
The Serum Institute in India is also producing this vaccine.
The third phase of clinical trials of this vaccine, developed from a dead virus, is underway in collaboration with ICMR.
For this, Zydus Cadila, a pharma company, has enlisted the help of the Department of Biotechnology.
The vaccine has been developed by the local Gamali National Center.
The Serum Institute of Pune has partnered with NovaVax, a pharma company.
It is manufactured by Hyderabad-based Biological E Limited Company.
It is being manufactured by Genova Company, Pune.
The vaccine, based on the dead rabies vetker, has reached the next stage of pre-clinical trials.
The vaccine is currently in the predevelopment stage.
According to a senior official, the estimate means a large group of the world's population is at risk."
But the WHO estimates that the number of infections is actually close to 80 million.
Since then, the 10-month period has been reversed. 
And in some countries the number of patients is even higher than before.
This figure varies according to different countries, cities and villages and different communities, he said.
The epidemic won't go away, you know.
 The United States, India, and Brazil have the highest rates of infection.
He was later discharged from the hospital on Monday.
About 12 people close to Donald Trump have been found to be cowardly so far.
The virus has killed 2.10 lakh people so far.
Schools, colleges, libraries, mosques and other public places in and around the capital, Tehran, have been ordered closed.
Airport officials say very few people are currently traveling by air.
As a result, the situation is getting worse day by day.
The need to speed up vaccination to overcome the corona crisis, Dr. Expressed by Singh.
It will also include people under the age of 45.
However, this potential is increasingly in the private sector.
Besides, I think it's time to implement a mandatory licensing provision, so that companies can make vaccines under one license.
In case of emergency, relief should be given on import of vaccines.
Former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Home Minister Dilip Walse Patil have come face to face over the injection.
Opposition leaders Devendra Fadnavis and Praveen Darekar then reached the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Police at BKC.
When the police called the director of Brooks Pharma to the police station yesterday to inquire into the matter, Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council Praveen Darekar and his associates reached the spot.
They were called in that way.
They told us that we had stockpiles of remedesivir and that he could give us permission. "
Earlier, after receiving information about the stockpile, the police called Rajesh Dokania.
If a police officer gets information, the police investigate.
In Maharashtra, the people of BJP are taking the role of selling themselves by taking the stocks they have, said Nawab Malik.
We were aware of this shortage.
The directors of the pharma company were questioned and released.
If so, then Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray should come forward and clarify the truth.
But Maharashtra is suffering the consequences of inefficient and corrupt government in the state.
The central government is trying to produce enough oxygen in the country.
In this letter, he has raised these issues.
But this drug is being used on an experimental basis, Ramdesivir is not a life-saving drug.
Many in our arena have symptoms of covid.
He is said to be between 65-70 years of age.
How can it be that Niranjani Akhada is going out?
He was told he was not ready to speak.
This will send a message that these monks and monks are worried about Corona.
The crowd will decrease.
For this, we tried to contact Rajinder Puri, the secretary of Niranjani Akhada, but we could not establish contact.
Of these, 35 are monks.
He said that he will leave his arena on April 27 after taking a bath.
Corona has not appeared in our arena.
We are very careful.
Some of the lockdown rules outside the containment zone will be relaxed and the guidelines will come into effect from September 1, 2020.
The standard operating procedure for starting Metro will be announced by the Ministry of Housing.
This rule will come into force from September 21, 2020.
Of course, some concessions have been made in the rules for starting educational institutions in non-containment zones from September 21.
Not much has changed in the rules regarding the determination of containment zones.
The Unlock 4 guidelines clearly state that no permission or e-pass is required.
However, an outbreak of the corona virus has affected tourism here.
As many as 7,000 people have tested positive for covid in a single day.
Their main emphasis is on luxury.
In fact, a village.
Many people come here to spend their leisure time.
Most of these tourists come for a week.
No one at the party observed social discrimination, he said.
40% of the tourists who come to us are foreigners.
Secondly, corona was found in our own resort.
However, it could not be avoided.
There are 15 thousand beds.
However, those who come to 'Village Naturiste' do not use masks for swinging. How about using a mask in swinging?
After that they both came to this village together.
Even though we all took risks, the lockdown was very severe and long lasting.
Both were naked.
Young people are taking more risks.
The resort's director, Karim Isartel, told the BBC: "I had to lay off 22 of my staff.
This is a special place for 'Naked Foam Party'.
So much so that I had to put up posters all over the place telling everyone to be patient, Le Glamor Nightclub will start soon.
They have about 120 outlets.
We have to lay off 300 of our 800 employees.
The ERV has at least 25,000 tourists this season.
On the contrary, he says, everyone is trying to look more attractive in this situation.
Women with chains around their waists and men with full body shaves are seen walking on the beach.
There are also some young people.
The whole affair is for a glance, and in a few moments, several couples are seen chatting at the table.
However, there are still some tourists.
But no effective vaccine has yet been found to combat the corona virus.
He registered a vaccine on Covid on 11 August.
But the vaccine has been criticized for not undergoing a third phase of medical testing.
According to the World Health Organization, 34 companies are trying to make a vaccine against corona.
They have reached the pre-clinical stage so far.
This vaccine is considered to be the most effective vaccine ever.
But experts say four other viruses of the corona virus species still exist in the world.
The vaccine is expected to be available in a few months.
Scientists are also asking how many doses of the vaccine will be needed to keep the corona away.
We are not going to make any profit from this vaccine, he said.
We take our own products, while AstraZeneca outsource their work."
The third phase of medical testing of this vaccine has been completed.
According to him, there are no side effects of this vaccine.
It will cost19.50 per dose for the US government. T
It can cost the average citizen up to40.
Proper disposal of thousands of kilos of bio-medical waste generated every day is a major challenge facing the state government.
Therefore, once used, these items need to be disposed of properly.
The growing contagion of the corona then began to generate large amounts of organic waste.
The State Pollution Control Board released a report in July.
The number of biomedical waste generated in Mumbai due to Covid-19 has increased by thousands of kilos.
Of this, 8544 kg was collected from the hospital and 3175 kg from the quarantine center.
The smoke coming out of burning organic waste has caused a lot of trouble to the locals.
The company is constantly emitting black smoke.
Millions of people live in this area.
If this is not done properly, we are ready to go to the National Green Tribunal and, if necessary, to the Supreme Court, Saif added.
Samajwadi Party MLA Raees Sheikh said, "The health of the people is in danger as this organic waste disposal company is overcrowded.
Exhaust fumes from the company accumulate in people's homes.
The city generates more than 4000 kg of biological medical waste every day.
There are questions about where the biomedical waste trucks are loaded and transported.
Biological medical waste is not disposed of properly.
There are 31 common medical waste treatment plants in the state.
However, Covid-19 caused a sudden change in the biological waste.
In rural areas, one has to go far to dispose of organic waste.
The government has taken action against an organic waste disposal plant in Tamil Nadu. "
The tracking software has been installed in 150 of the 198 bio-waste disposal plants, he added.
Lata Ghanshamnani says, "Biomedical waste is going to be the most serious problem in the future.
The challenge facing the government is proper transportation and segregation of biomedical waste.
PPE kits are now being used in saloons and aircraft.
So that it can be disposed of properly.
What is the reason behind this? This question was asked by Trinamool Congress leader and MP Mala Roy.
The migration began several months later.
However, after the lockdown, thousands of laborers were seen returning to their respective states on foot, not only on highways but also on railway tracks.
We drank sugar water for three days.
Before the lockdown, her husband used to work in Delhi.
But number seven had brought a meal prepared in the alley.
Somehow, it took three days.
The landlord was also asking for rent.
The landlord is asking for rent.
She has just given birth to a baby.
There were food and drink problems.
So we set off on foot.
I didn't even have money for food and drink.
What to say nowThe train reached Bihar from Delhi.
However, there are some laborers who have returned to the village on foot but have not been able to find work in the village.
From there I went to Ghaziabad on foot.
People couldn't help it, so I walked to the village. "
Suppose a sub-district hospital in a rural area has 25 ventilators but 23 of them are not operational, Hershal Gangurde, a local journalist from Chandwad, told me over the phone.
And the other 23 critically ill patients have to be sent to another place, most of the time in the city.
This is not the first case in the state.
Explaining this, Pune Mayor Murlidhar Mohol had said that they are lying down as there is no technician to use these ventilators.
There is a dearth of skilled manpower to operate these ventilators and we will fill that gap, he explained.
Therefore, despite the equipment, it does not benefit the patient, it should be noted by the senior administration," says Aher.
I know what the Covid patient's state of mind is."
I mean, if there is treatment here, I don't have to go to Nashik.
He told BBC Marathi about an incident he had experienced.
He was talking to everyone as long as he was in Chandwad hospital.
I don't know what his medical condition was, what the complications were, but I sincerely think his deteriorating mentality made his condition worse.
Taluka Health Officer Dr. According to Pankaj Thackeray, 694 positive patients have been found there so far and 15 have died.
Often a patient from a rural area is lying in an ambulance waiting for a bed for hours on end with oxygen.
About 160 of these ventilators have been given to rural areas, and I can assure you that out of these 160 ventilators, only a handful can be operated.
But another reason for the spread in rural areas is the misconceptions of the people, Dr. Shinde clearly states.
Many people think that people are being cheated under the name of Corona.
On the one hand, the BJP is trapping the state government by asking why the ventilators from this fund are not being used, while the opposition at the Center is raising questions on the Modi government from this fund.
Social activists are demanding that the trust deed be made public.
He also alleged that justice was being done to the donors in the state government relief fund, and a justice was being done to the donors in PM cares.
Many of them need oxygen.
At other times the cylinder lasts at least 9 hours.
But they could not get help from anyone.
They are tasked with obtaining oxygen from dealers or manufacturers in the best possible way.
We are fighting every day to get oxygen.
But their oxygen levels are low.
Of this, 15 per cent oxygen is used in the hospital.
These tanks are sent to hospitals.
It contains oxygen in the form of gases.
Meanwhile, corona is also seen spreading widely in small towns and rural areas.
Over the past few days, more than 90,000 patients have been growing every day.
In April, the figure was 750 tonnes.
The government has also been cured in a way.
On the other hand, lack of oxygen in hospitals will endanger people's lives.
This requires a truck to send the cylinder to other locations.
It is coming to the fore that black market is taking place in this.
The death toll is expected to rise if oxygen is not available.
But officials rejected the claim.
The supplier did not send the cylinder as the bill was not paid at that time.
A supplier said that there was no supply in Chhindwara for a week.
We have never had such a situation.
Corona's 400 and Intensive Care's 110 out of 110 beds were filled.
Last week, they donated a large cylinder to another hospital.
Some leading scientists have reported this.
But what exactly happens with the vaccine needs to be looked at more rationally and practically, say scientists at the Royal Society in a report.
In such a case the restrictions imposed by the corona must be gradually removed.
The Royal Society, however, said it was a long reaction.
It can take six months, nine months, maybe even years, says Nilay Shah, head professor of chemical engineering at Imperial College London.
The report says that there are many obstacles in this regard.
RNA doses are being done on a large scale, never before.
Not only glass bottles but also refrigeration facilities are a challenge to prepare the vaccine.
It will also require trained staff.
But they are completely safe and have not been studied to reduce the symptoms of covid.
We don't know how effective it will be and we don't know when it will be available, said Charles Bangam, head professor of immunology at Imperial College London.
Does the vaccine need to be withdrawn every one to two years?
If one person refuses to vaccinate his or her spouse, it may harm the other.
That number is lower than in the last two weeks of last month.
Corona infection deaths have also declined in the states.
In comparison, testing in October was much higher.
However, caution should be exercised in interpreting these figures, say pathologists.
However, experts say that it is wrong to conclude that the coronavirus is slowing down.
In some patients, the reliability of this rapid antigen test is as high as 50%.

This test involves separating the genetic material from the swab sample.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.
his number is about 10 per cent of the Indian population.
This is 15% more than the government figures.
However, efforts should be made to keep the fire under control.
This needs to be monitored, he says.
He says that these stages often happen.
Then in October the number of swine flu patients increased once again.
The United States is now entering its third phase after campus reopened, according to infectious disease experts.
Festivals will start soon in India.
You have to get used to this 'pause, restart and drive' until half the world's population is infected.
However, the next stage is production and distribution.
After the development of vaccines, a comprehensive vaccination campaign has to be carried out and this is the biggest challenge facing the world today.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak killed millions worldwide.
Ebola was most prevalent in West Africa between 2014 and 2016.
These clinical trials were completed in November 2016.
However, concerted efforts are being made around the world to bring this period to 18 months, taking full care of vaccine safety.
There are several stages in vaccine development.
Due to the urgent need for vaccines, parallel steps are being taken in this manner.
However, since different phases of the Covid-19 vaccine are running simultaneously, their findings are also being examined simultaneously.
There is a huge financial risk involved.
It will cost about 10 billion dollars.
An example of a cake can be given for this.
Brian Dean, director of New Medicines and Data Policy at the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industry, says, "The way we prepare something on a small scale is not the same as the way to produce on a large scale."
In this, the production of vaccine is gradually increased.
This also adds to the problem.
This means that in order to make this vaccine available to people around the world, double the dose of the world's population will have to be prepared.
Research is underway on some DNA-based vaccines.
The extremely strong current generated by this device opens a hole in the cell lining and releases a drug or vaccine through this hole.
In addition, health workers need to be trained to use these devices.
For example- glass bottles or vials for keeping vaccines.
This can also limit the early distribution of the vaccine.
However, if all these doses are not used within a certain time, the dose is likely to be wasted.
Most vaccines need to be kept at a very cold temperature.
Many medical centers do not have such facilities.
These monitors will be useful to check if there is any effect on the vaccine temperature during transport."
The 'last mile problem' is the difficulty in getting the vaccine to remote areas.
Everyone is likely to have to wait until summer to get vaccinated.
After five days in the hospital, he was not rescued.
Anil Hebber's friend was 62 years old and working as a social worker.
Since March, 10 of Anil's close acquaintances have died of the corona virus.
I thought it should stop and that's why I volunteered for the Covid-19 vaccine test.
Genetic modifications have been made to this virus.
Among them is a lot of hope from the vaccine that Oxford is making.
It also includes Anil Hebber.
India ranks second in the world in terms of corona victims after the United States.
There is a lot of risk involved in such tests.
He says his 11-year-old daughter asked him many questions about the test.
This also increased the concern of the family.
He says, "I'm not scared at all.
By then, they had learned that 55 people had registered for the sixth month of the test.
There the doctors took their blood samples and also took saliva samples for the Covid-19 test.
Took a consent form from them and gave them the first dose of the vaccine.
This will be followed by a second dose of the vaccine in November.
I was just a little tired.
Maybe it was because I was driving too long."
As a result, Anil Hebber's company also closed down.
After being homeless and lost my job, I delivered food and other necessities to thousands of people stranded in Mumbai.
I visited the intensive care units of the hospital.
Plus, get your friends registered too.
I am confident that this vaccine will be a success.
Many areas are having difficulty getting birth control pills and condoms.
If this situation continues, 29.5 million women in India may have unwanted pregnancies, the Foundation for Reproductive Health Services, India said in a report .
The woman became pregnant during the lockdown.
The couple already has two children.
Recently, many people from the city started returning to their respective villages.
Finally, in June, the woman went to a private hospital and had an abortion at a cost of Rs 15,000.
Therefore, the identity of such couples has not been revealed by BBC Marathi as per the request.
By the time we met her, the abortion surgery hadn’t even turned upside down.
She said she had to undergo sonography three times in five months because the government hospital did not have such facilities.
The sonography revealed that the fetus was not growing properly.
It was completely closed.
The husband works part time in Pune.
At a rate of Rs 50 per thousand per month."
Therefore, she will have to face mental, physical and then financial burden.
As a result, there is a picture of hammering on the services that are always running.
But in the current situation, abortion has become more expensive, experts say.
As the pregnancy progresses, it becomes more and more difficult to get the facility.
The cost of all the PPE kits used by anesthesiologists and other specialist doctors and staff will ultimately be borne by the patients.
That needs to be addressed immediately. '
2 lakh 54 thousand 325 couples used condoms.
Last year, 29,854 interval injections were given, while nearly 1.5 lakh contraceptive pills were used.
District Health Officer Dr. Hanumant Wadgave said, "Initially, surgery was risky due to fear of corona infection.
In 2019, India's fertility rate was 2.5 percent.
The first phase of polling is taking place in Bihar on October 28.
Doctors say the coronavirus could spread more rapidly.
However, it does not seem to have any effect on campaign rallies.
Very few of them seem to be wearing masks.
The RJD, the Congress and the Left are also trying.
People have stopped caring for lives and leaders don't seem to be taking enough steps to make them aware of it."
The state government says the number of infections has come down in the last few weeks.
He says the government is talking about a rapid antigen test that reports in 30 minutes.
But it contained 11,732 tests of RT-PCR.
Despite being infected, people can spread the virus from place to place.
It will only aggravate the problem.
People live in families together.
The air in northern India is more polluted when it starts getting colder after November.
I am terrified at the thought of what a terrible situation will arise if we do not take care in the coming weeks."
What exactly is the reason behind this?
Gym and religious places were not opened during the unlock process.
According to the alert system in England, gyms with treadmills have been closed.
Is it more dangerous to start a gym than shops and hotels in the Corona era?
Corona infection can be prevented with effective air conditioning, regular cleaning, social distinguishing, and sanitation.
At the same time, they need to ensure that their financial balance is not disturbed.
Pubs etc. may be allowed to continue.
But this is a political decision.
Everyone working in the gym agreed to keep going.
Restrictions were then imposed on the gym.
Retail centers and hotels will continue, he said.
But 29-year-old Jack O'Callaghan is skeptical about starting a gym.
Jack lives there.
So I went there as soon as the gym started, ”Jack said.
So that you can exercise safely there.
They want the gym staff to enforce the rules more strictly.
But people go straight without doing that, they think we can go and handle the equipment directly.
However, according to the World Health Organization, the vaccines for covid-19 that are being developed around the world need to be stored below zero degrees Celsius.
They call this vaccine 'hot vaccine'.
He and his team have tested the vaccine on animals.
They need funding for human testing of this vaccine.
The vaccines are licensed and approved by the World Health Organization.
According to the World Health Organization, these vaccines are useful in the event of a major emergency.
In this case, vaccines that do not require cold storage are very useful. "
It is one of the largest vaccination programs in the world.
Through this network, doses can be delivered to more than 80 lakh places.
Thus the vaccine has to be kept at a cool temperature and transported to remote areas.
"There is a large-scale vaccination and vaccination campaign in India.
2-8 degrees Celsius, minus 20 degrees Celsius and minus 70 degrees Celsius.
India has one of the highest cold storage capacity in the world.
The quality of the vaccine deteriorates upon exposure to high temperatures.
However, we want to vaccinate the entire population.
But this year's Diwali will not be as usual.
This Diwali, the desire to set off firecrackers seems to be on the wane this year.
The Maharashtra government has also appealed to the citizens of the state to celebrate Diwali free from firecrackers.
This year, Corona joined the discussion.
Similarly, pollution from firecrackers also causes many respiratory ailments.
The BBC asked experts what exactly was the connection between the corona and the firecrackers.
In winter, due to fog, the smoke does not go up.
It spreads through small water droplets.
Post-covid OPD has been started for such patients at KEM, Fortis, St. George and other hospitals in Mumbai.
This can lead to an increase in asthma, COPD or allergies.
This condition can also affect a healthy person.
Patients with corona infection are advised to do breathing exercises.
The amount of oxygen decreases and many toxic gases increase in the air.
Cyber ​​attack on Reddy's company
The company is now developing more than 200 products that eliminate gastroenterology, oncology, pain management and cardiovascular disease.
The vaccine is being tested in the third phase.
A single dose of the vaccine will cost between Rs 500 and Rs 600, the organization said.
Let's understand the government's plan to make the vaccine available to the public.
He also said that 30 crore people would be vaccinated from August to September.
It will be challenging for the Indian government to control this temperature.
However, this system will not be sufficient for the storage of modern and Pfizer vaccines.
These vaccines can be stored in the general freezer.
Vaccine doses will be provided according to the needs of each country.
Two of these are in the third and final stages.
He said, "Some of the vaccines we have contracted with can be effective even with a single dose.
Which vaccine to take will depend on the government and the public.
They have agreements with vaccine companies operating in other countries.
Therefore, the government has set some priorities.
These doses should be taken at intervals of two to three weeks.
Therefore, they will be vaccinated as a matter of priority. "
Then people between the ages of 50 and 65 will be vaccinated.
The government has set up a committee on how to make the vaccine available to the public.
Work has already started three months ago on a plan to deliver the vaccine to every village in every state of the country.
The vaccine is called 'Covishield'.
In the second or third quarter of 2021, 100 million doses of this vaccine will be ready.
But all this is possible if the Indian government wants it, Punawala said.
The current production of corona vaccine is not enough and it will take another 4 to 5 years to reach everyone, said Adar Poonawala, CEO of Serum Institute.
The vaccine will be available in 92 countries, the Serum Institute said.
Just think, how many days have passed since you touched a person or you touched a person?
Some people may not have even shaken hands in the last six months.
Is there a famine of touch?
Does our society experience the happiness that comes from this touch?
It was created by Michael Banise, a psychiatrist at Goldsmith University, for online study and published at the end of January 2020.
Are they ready to use a device for shakehand?
The majority of respondents reported their answers before the lockdown and social distance rules.
43% of people write that society does not help in getting enough touch, while 26% of people write that society provides such touch.
So modern times have taught us new things.
Do these two things affect this feeling?
It is not in their nature to get emotionally close to someone because of touch.
Wherever it was possible to touch, attitudes toward touch have changed.
Individuals with a positive attitude to touch are less likely to feel lonely than others.
In the UK and elsewhere it was done in the early days of the lockdown.
But then let's take a look at these two researches to understand exactly what happened in the lockdown.
Fairhurst is a professor of biopsychology at the Bundeswehr University in Munich, Germany.
This causes certain messages to be sent from the nerves to the brain.
They must have had a good chance to touch each other.
Even the people living in the house did not touch each other much.
Cells on the skin immediately recognize pain or other things.
During this time, stress releases a hormone called cortisol, which increases the amount of oxytocin that causes love.
How much longer do you need to stay away from others?
Fairhurst is now in the process of creating an app.
It cannot be said that this is much better than the previous hug.
About 60% of the world's vaccines are made in India.
Is one of the largest health plans in the world.
This includes the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which is being produced and tested by the Serum Institute.
The priority is to get a home-made vaccine, said Dr. Krishna Kumar, secretary of the Department of Biotechnology.
It will take at least two years for half the Indians to be vaccinated, she said.
This is a warehouse where vaccines can be stored at extremely low and controlled temperatures.
(Almost all vaccines have to be transported from one place to another with a temperature of 2 C to 8 C.)
This means that care will automatically be taken to ensure that needles fail after one use and that they are not reused or re-infected.
There is also the question of how to dispose of used vaccines after such a large number of vaccinations.
But Covid's vaccination campaign will require more numbers.
So it will be difficult to decide who to give it to first.
But it will not be so easy, experts say.
So it will be a big challenge to prioritize who to give the vaccine to, said epidemiologist Dr. Chandrakant Lahariya says.
This is the second largest statistic in the world.
So will the states that have been hit hardest by the outbreak be vaccinated first?
And how to prevent counterfeit vaccines from being sold in remote markets?
India's system of monitoring for side effects after vaccination is 34 years old.
And the incidence of serious side effects is lower than expected.
Private companies can cover the cost of vaccinating their employees, he said.
Two such doses will have to be given.
In addition, Oxford and AstraZeneca will distribute the vaccine in the UK and Europe, he said.
Later, Adar Poonawala, CEO and owner of Siram, gave a press conference and gave more information about the Prime Minister's visit and the vaccine on Corona.
So far, the government has not decided on how many doses of vaccine to take from us.
We were amazed at his knowledge about the vaccine.
If a person is vaccinated with corona, they will not have to be hospitalized.
Narendra Modi was in the Serum Institute for about a quarter of an hour.
He also informed about the planning of vaccine production, said Narendra Modi.
Therefore, leaders of BJP or any other political party were not present at this time.
I want to clarify this, said Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan.
Only then can we analyze, he added.
After that, there is no need to vaccinate the entire population, said ICMR Director General Dr. Balram Bhargava said.
The role of the mask will be crucial even after the vaccination campaign.
In the letter, Pfizer sought permission to import, sell and distribute anti-Covid-19 vaccine in India.
Pfizer-BioNTech claims that the anti-corona vaccine provides 95 percent protection from the virus.
Therefore, it will be a big challenge for the government to bring this vaccine to the people of India.
The company is considering various options.
The third phase of testing of vaccines developed by Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech-ICMR has started.
Mumbai Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Chahal has issued orders in this regard.
Earlier, the state government had issued separate orders regarding schools.
These testing camps are also in municipal schools.
Accordingly, the Mumbai Municipal Commissioner discussed the matter with me in the morning.
Initially, classes IX to XII will be started."
If the same situation persists for the next 15-20 days, a decision will be taken to start the school, explained Varsha Gaikwad.
The guidelines for starting schools have already been announced by the central government.
So we will make a wise decision.
Even so, said Varsha Gaikwad.
But some private schools went to court against it.
We will investigate and take action, the school education minister assured.
Therefore, the question before the government is how long the admission should be postponed.
In the next two days, he will discuss law and justice.
Remove the ventilator, I don't want to live anymore, she was repeatedly telling the doctor.
But even when they came home, they were kept on oxygen.
In this disease, the delicate part of the lung is damaged.
That's what they say.
He died within a few days.
The question of working for hours and dying has come up.
But the infection kept growing and so did the number of patients.
Often the patient was admitted to the hospital in the final stages.
He is a doctor by profession.
He was the only one earning in his house.
He was overcoming the corona virus.
The patient was with us for 45 days.
Hospitals are flooded with patients.
The number of staff to care for Corona patients is staggering.
Be it a plastic surgeon or an ENT specialist, or an anesthesiologist.
Health workers say you are completely tired.
Health workers say you are completely tired.
At the same time, they are at risk of a life-threatening illness.
But he may have a heart condition, or he may have symptoms of dengue, acid reflux.
The routine is to take a patient's swab for a corona test, keep the suspected patient in a separate room, and ask them to stay indoors until the test report is known.
Winning the trust of these patients is a very difficult task.
Working with gloves and a PPE kit in hand, you start to feel like you are locked in a coffin.
Some of the photos were of night shifts.
He had also posted the photo of his wrinkled hands on social media.
A doctor in Delhi told me that he had visited his son six months later.
Some used to stay in hotels.
So he decided to become a home-quarantine.
After that, they have to be tested every time they return to work.
Examining patients, seeing the dead, staying in hotels, isolating oneself from the world."
Many have lost loved ones to this infection.
They also want therapy."
Everyone is behaving as if the company is over."
According to him, "Indian doctors are facing different problems due to fatigue.
Fearing the Corona, all parties feel that the winter session of Parliament should be canceled.
"If that happens, we can start the budget session," Joshi said in the letter.
It revealed that many leaders have expressed fears about Corona.
Schools have also been started in many states.
The winter session of Parliament was canceled under the name of Corona.
For this, as per the instructions given by the Health Department of the Government of Maharashtra, a City Task Force has been constituted for the Mumbai Municipal Corporation area.
The process of setting up a regional level (department office level) committee like City Task Force is also required to be completed soon.
The area of ​​about 5,000 sq. Ft. Has been designated as Regional Vaccine Store.
A digital platform has also been set up by the government to collect and manage all the statistical information in the vaccination program.
These questions will be on your mind too.
That is, the government will not put pressure on anyone.
Here are some important questions that may come to your mind:
Preference will be given to health workers, frontline workers, the elderly, citizens suffering from other ailments.
Also, the rules of social distance must be followed.
More than 2.24 lakh people have been vaccinated against corona so far, according to the Union Ministry of Health.
This is only 0.2 per cent of the total vaccinated people.
On the first day, the government wanted to vaccinate 3 lakh 16 thousand people.
In Delhi, 54 per cent of the scheduled population was vaccinated.
Why are there other reasons?
This figure is even higher than the US, Britain and France.
This problem can be caused by a vaccine, by the vaccination process or by some other reason.
These are called minor adversarial effects.
They are considered serious cases.
Such cases are considered very serious.
Two of them have been released from the hospital after treatment.
It is common to see 5 to 10 per cent adverse effects during the entire vaccination process."
The cause is not vaccination.
There is no need for that.
Medical details should be taken before vaccinating any person.
According to the guidelines issued by the government, this information is given to every person who gets vaccinated.
A separate form must be filled out even if the family is not ready for it.
It is clear that the side effect is due to the drug used in the vaccine or to the quality of the vaccine.
There is a lack of long term study data regarding corona vaccine being given in the country.
Often different symptoms are experienced.
Some children develop a mild fever after the DPT vaccine.
According to him, the serious side effects of the covacin vaccine have not been seen in at least three stages.
The proportion of such victims will be 10 percent.
One crore children are vaccinated in the country for three days during the polio campaign.
What is the reason for running away from the vaccine?
The reason for running away from the vaccine is not directly related to the side effect.
In the early stages of the vaccination process, there is a lot of skepticism and opposition.
As of January 3, 69 per cent of people in the country are skeptical about the vaccine.
According to the survey, skepticism about the vaccine has been on the rise for months.
Two of these, the Pfizer and Modernna vaccines, are mRNA vaccines.
These include Kovacin, developed by Bharat Biotech, and the Chinese vaccine.
No side effects were observed after vaccine campaigns other than the mRNA vaccine.
In the first phase of vaccination, three crore healthcare workers and frontline workers will be
There are 27 crore such people in India.
All of them are said to be in the range of Rs 80 lakh to Rs 1 crore.
The number of this group is about 2 crores.
After the state level steering committee, there is a state action force, state control room, district action force at district level, district control room, taluka action force at taluka level and taluka control room.
From there, the vaccine will be shipped to 37 state-run stores.
For this, Mumbai Municipal Corporation has set up a vaccine center of 5000 square feet in Kanjurmarg.
Only then will approval be given, said Somani.
Poonawala has clarified that the serum vaccine will be given to the government at Rs 200 and to the public at Rs 1,000 .
Health workers are classified into nine groups for vaccination.
Using them, people of different ages will be tracked and registered on a digital platform called Co-WIN, the Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network.
The Center has issued instructions to all states to allow them to stay there for half an hour after vaccination and to monitor and vaccinate only one person at a time.
One in five people will be vaccinated, about 500 teams will be deployed in Mumbai, said Suresh Kakani, head of the task force and additional commissioner.
A Regional Vaccine Store of about 5,000 sq. Ft. Will be set up at Kanjurmarg.
After that, the citizens will be monitored for half an hour to see if they are affected by the vaccine."
The system is called Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network System (Co-Win).
The Center has said that measures need to be taken for this.
If the relevant vaccination center has a waiting room, observation center, seating capacity for large number of people, as well as large luggage storage, another vaccination officer will be deployed there.
For this, any of the 12 identity cards like voting card, Aadhar card, vehicle license, passport, PAN card can be used.
But so far no vaccine has been approved.
Speaking to Reuters, VK Paul said: "At present, it is not expected that modern or Pfizer vaccines will be supplied to India by the second half of 2021.
However, no evidence has been provided for this.
You can become impotent.
India's top drug regulator has also said such claims are " extremely wrong ".
However, the organization has made it clear that the vaccine is completely safe.
Decades ago, when a massive polio eradication campaign was launched in India, some people refused to be vaccinated by making similar false claims.
This claim was also widely discussed on social media.
It was later removed.
There may be a charge for vaccination.
This means that the vaccine is completely free in the United States.
However, the government has not yet said whether the vaccine will be free in the next phase or how much it will cost.
However, this post does not specify which corona vaccine contains pork.
The Covishield vaccine developed by Oxford in association with AstraZeneca in the UK and the Covacin vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech in India.
However, Chinese vaccine is not allowed in India.
In Muslim-majority Indonesia, for example.
One of the theories is that lashi has a microchip.
The clergy claim that the vaccine contains a microchip and that the microchip controls your brain when you take the vaccine.
The cold will start in a few days.
We are also following it.
These things will be important when the children start going to school and more and more people start going to the office.
The virus lingers in the air in microscopic forms.
According to this, it was mentioned that everyone should get 10 liters of pure free air.
Said Highwell Davis.
But understand what it looks like.
This AC takes in the surrounding air, cools it and releases it.
It's okay to go to a place with AC for a while but don't stay there for long.
But he did not know it.
You may have such a question.
The air in or out of the room is drawn in and released by the air handling unit on the terrace.
He works at the University of Leeds and is on the government's Environmental Advisory Committee.
The ventilation system is in the hands of the building manager.
If the filters are checked regularly, the virus can be controlled in time.
He is the head of this project.
He will tell you that fresh air is an important issue.
Guides on how to keep air circulation in supermarkets and food processing units.
You open the window, where does the air go?
According to him, the risk of exposure to the fresh air virus is less risky than the rest.
Corona patients peaked in September .
Corona has averaged less than 100 deaths per day in seven days.
India ranks second in the world after the United States in terms of corona patients.
India is no exception.
There is no miracle behind this, says virologist Dr. Shahid Jamil says.
But we do know that India is still far from herd immunity."
That is, when the body of a person in a society develops immunity to a disease, the effect of that disease begins to diminish.
In cities like Delhi and Pune, the proportion is up to 50 per cent.
However, if these people move to less infected areas, they may become vulnerable.
In all of these places, there have been significant changes in the virus they came in contact with.
Also, we do not consider India as a factor.
Although visible, it was very low.
But, if that is the case, then we have to explain why there are so many patients with mild symptoms in India, said the Delhi-based center.
India's method of certifying deaths is weak and large numbers of people die at home.
There are about 6 lakh villages in India.
The lockdown, which lasted nearly 70 days, has largely prevented corona infections and deaths, scientists believe.
Brazil, for example, is three times more urbanized than India, which is why scientists say there are more infections and deaths.
This includes construction workers, street vendors.
June to September is the rainy season in the country and floods occur in South Asia every year.
As a result, new species of corona can spread rapidly to areas far from infection, and this can lead to new outbreaks.
It is not yet clear whether some other species have already spread in the country.
So far this strain has been found in 50 countries around the world and now it is being recognized as the major strain in the world .
It could ruin all your math.
About 6 million people were vaccinated in one month.
Don't rush, use a mask regularly and wash your hands frequently, experts are urging people.
This list will be updated weekly.
The number of coronaviruses in these districts has doubled in less than 4 days.
So many questions are naturally being asked about whether the lockdown is really working.
It is not possible to observe social distance there.
But you can see how summer has come, and as the temperature has risen, so have the corona patients.
The temperature is not the same outside in summer and it is not strange inside your body.
The outbreak of SARS occurred in 2002.
If one sneezes in the scorching sun, the droplets containing the corona will dry out quickly and this may slow down the spread of the corona to some extent, he says.
We need to take drastic measures at the public level."
During this time the immune system is weakened.
If I were to talk about my wife, I would advise her to be careful, wash her hands and take care."
But initially no other animal was found to have the virus.
Scientists are investigating why.
However, there was no evidence of corona infection in humans from an animal, the report said.
An associate professor of animal toxins at the University of Nottingham, Dr. "The fur is a fabric-like surface, so if it has the corona virus on it, it can enter the body and become infected," says Rekhel Tarlinton.
It is safest to use N95 mask.
That's fine - this is a dangerous thing to do, because the virus can get in the way.
According to the World Health Organization, only two types of people should wear masks -
Because if that were possible, hundreds of lives would be saved every day.
But there is no evidence that eating certain foods can fight the corona virus.
All their expenses are borne by the government.
Even if I had to be admitted to a private hospital for that, it was covered.
He has instructed all insurance companies to cover the disease.
You too can make cashless transactions and clean your hands immediately after using cards or notes.
The important thing is to avoid crowds.
Citizens above 60 years of age will be vaccinated from March 1, the central government has announced.
It is noteworthy that coronavirus vaccine will be provided free of cost at all government centers, said Prakash Javadekar.
But in the initial phase, only Kovid-warriors will be vaccinated, the central government had said.
Since then, various government officials and employees have also been vaccinated.
After that, the citizens will be monitored for half an hour to see if they are affected by the vaccine."
The system is called Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network System (Co-Win).
Priority will be given for that.
The Center has said that measures need to be taken for this.
If the relevant vaccination center has a waiting room, observation center, seating capacity for large number of people, as well as large luggage storage, another vaccination officer will be deployed there.
For this, any of the 12 identity cards like voting card, Aadhar card, vehicle license, passport, PAN card can be used.
But so far no vaccine has been approved.
Speaking to Reuters, VK Paul said: "At present, it is not expected that modern or Pfizer vaccines will be supplied to India by the second half of 2021.
Some of these measures seem to be effective.
Now my mission is to find out from leaders and health officials around the world what they have prioritized to control the virus.
However, below are some of the key strategies that have been effective and efficient around the world.
Xu Yeon their daughter.
Earlier in 2015, Mercury was found in East Asia.
They benefited from the preparations made by South Korea during the Mercury period.
She was quarantined at her father's house for two weeks after returning home.
The General Physician of North-East England, Dr. Speaking to BBC Panorama, David Hodge said: "The current situation is very challenging.
Until then, the UK government was working to find a link.
A hospital like Yangji in Seoul, South Korea, was completely reserved for Kovid.
These used to be different squads.
Usha herself used to bring various items for them, bring their medicines.
For those who are in isolation at home or in hospitals, 600 boxes were provided free of cost daily from this kitchen.
However, a scheme to pay 500 euros to those living in isolation at home in the UK was launched in September.
According to the report, less than 20 percent of those in isolation fully complied with the rules.
That experience was with Gathi, said Kerala Health Minister K. K. Says Shaileja.
Kerala had the highest number of corona in India in March last year.
They not only provided discounts on taxi services for seniors, set aside time for shopping, but also distributed free masks from door to door.
Germany's central government gave each state the freedom to make its own decisions.
However, there were allegations that tests were declining.
This is the largest vaccination campaign to date in the UK and has been successfully implemented.
The UK Department of Health and Social Services has been planning to vaccinate since there were no covid patients in the country.
He, like many others, took part in Johnson & Johnson's trials for the Covid-19 vaccine.
The Covax program is being implemented under this organization.
Mutations are more likely to occur in countries that cannot afford to buy large quantities of the vaccine.
Therefore, we have achieved an important success in the fight against Covid-19 disease.
It would be a mistake to forget everything and lead a normal life when this is over.
Learn from these eight graphics
This does not include the number of cured or the number of deaths.
In Maharashtra, there are restrictions on many things from November to December.
After that the number of patients gradually decreased.
Kerala ranks ninth in this list. (Statistics as of March 31)
But experts say research is needed.
That is, when the first wave began to recede, people became less anxious.
So the cities became crowded again and it became difficult to maintain social distance.
The graph of patient numbers shows how fast it has gone up here.
But its ability to cause illness seems to be relatively reduced.
The state's mortality rate fell to 1.94% at the end of March.
Mortality may increase in such cases.
How many beds are available in the major hotspot cities in the state, and what are the alternative arrangements?
As the incidence of the epidemic decreased, so did the number of screenings.
Speaking to BBC Hindi, experts have expressed concern over this.
If the rate of patient detection decreases even after further examination, it can be assumed that the outbreak is under control.
This means finding and isolating people who have come in contact with the patient.
So far 62 lakh 9,337 doses of vaccine have been given in the state.
The process will continue through the Co-Win portal.
Vaccination of people working in the health sector and citizens working in essential services started from February 2.
They have the highest risk of corona infection.
Bhushan Kumar pointed out that even after the phase of vaccination of persons above the age of 60 years, the staff in health and essential services were vaccinated.
It has become clear that people who do not meet the required criteria for health and emergency services are registering for the vaccine.
In this regard, discussions were held in the meeting with the representatives of the states and experts in this regard.
Meanwhile, employees in already registered health as well as essential services will be vaccinated.
At present, there are more than 4 lakh 70 thousand active corona patients in the state.
The state has enough stocks of vaccines for three days.
The mini-lockdown has been caused by the spread of corona infection in urban and rural areas.
On the other hand, the anti-corona vaccine, which has become a shield in the fight against Covid-19, is in short supply in the state.
According to the health department, 4.5 lakh people are being vaccinated every day in the state at present.
This stock is only enough for the next three days.
People are returning due to non-availability of vaccines.
These mutations have been found in cities like Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur.
Since this mutated virus suppresses the body's immune system, its susceptibility is high.
As many as 81 lakh people in the state have been given the first dose of anti-corona vaccine.
It is not the aim of the vaccination campaign to give vaccines to those who need them.
For this, 30 teams have been sent to Maharashtra, 11 to Chhattisgarh and 9 to Punjab.
According to Mayor Kishori Pednekar, there are more than one lakh doses of anti-covid vaccine left in Mumbai.
But, this stock is only enough for one day today (Wednesday).
The positivity rate of corona victims in Pune is 35 percent.
The BBC quoted Gondia District Health Officer Dr. Contacted Nitin Kapase.
So far, 2 lakh doses have been supplied in Amravati district.
More than 4 lakh people are being vaccinated every day in the state."
The state government has been asked about the vaccines.
Vaccine doses are for Nashik, Ahmednagar, Jalgaon, Dhule and Nandurbar districts.
Vaccination is underway at some centers.
The country has two anti-corona vaccines, covshield and covacin, which are supplied to the states by the central government.
This led to a dispute between the Center and the state.
This has created a shortage of vaccines."
States should have the right to formulate strategies for vaccination.
Why is it being used so much?
This queue was for the drug Remedesivir.
Eventually, there is a shortage of this drug in the state.
And does Remedesivir really save patients' lives?
These drugs were also used in different countries on the advice of local health experts.
One of the most important of these is remedivir.
It stated that the drug had "very little, if any, negligible effect" in saving the lives of covid patients.
In addition, the report noted that the drug did not have much success in reducing hospital stay.
It is recommended to use this medicine if the fever of the severe patient is not decreasing.
The stocks of Remedesivir will be placed under the jurisdiction of the District Collector and the stocks will be distributed to private hospitals as and when required.
For this, BBC Marathi contacted Dr. Trupti Gilda, an infectious disease specialist.
Therefore, remedivir is not a drug for corona. Gilda also agreed.
However, in India, remedicivir is being used whether the patient has any mild, regular or severe symptoms.
Ramdesivir is also included in the treatment of corona in many government hospitals.
However, the state government has taken steps to bring the situation under control.
As a result, the government intends to control both drug abuse and the black market.
Russia's Sputnik-5 vaccine has been approved by the Union Ministry.
A third vaccine will be available in India along with Sputnik V.
Dr. Reddy is one of the leading pharma companies in the country.
According to the report, the initial tests of the vaccine in Russia showed signs of an immune response to the vaccine.
Notably, this test did not cause any serious side effects.
This was reported by Maharashtra Times .
Halfkin is being allowed to develop the covacin vaccine for one year, as recommended by a committee of scientific experts.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for accepting his request and giving him permission.
It is said that millions of devotees have gathered here.
Of these, 1701 corona test reports were found to be positive
There are still some reports to come and this number is likely to go up to 2000, said Shambhu Kumar Jha, chief medical officer of Haridwar.
These include Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan.
Therefore, the Central Government informed that Oxygen Production Centers will be started in 100 hospitals from the PM Care Fund.
Our doors are open to all, Patole said at an event in Indapur.
These include Satara, Solapur and Buldana districts.
There were also hailstorms in some areas.
This has led to the loss of agriculture.
You may have seen the video of Ahmednagar where six people were set on fire on the same cheetah.
The figures come back the next day.
There should be a curse on a man that he doesn't want to take anything seriously until his man dies.
With a sigh, it should be difficult for him to finally take a breath to survive. Those who are gone are left behind, what about those who are left behind?
Some are in the hospital.
Six or seven cheetahs are burning side by side, and one body comes in every three minutes.
then one cemetery is reserved for Covid.
There is no one in the cemetery near the deceased.
That is what happened to my relative.
Leads directly to the cemetery.
Who will cry and for how long? The empty (!) Bed is to be given to the man hanging out in the living-dying chapter.
You don't have to give a shoulder, but you have to make an effort so that four people can come to give you a fire, to say goodbye.
His father moved to Corona, a small village, last year.
Loneliness does not leave even the one who cries for the dead.
Faceshield, faces hidden in masks.
When you go to the fourth floor, you only see clouds of burning cheetahs.
Fear is just a feeling of helplessness.
We are not naming him for his wishes
And there are different tests available for that.
The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) also made rules for covid tests from the beginning.
This test can tell if your body is infected with a small amount of corona.
Our body recognizes these antigens as foreign bodies.
But the biggest advantage is that the results can be obtained in about half an hour.
It can be checked on the spot.
Therefore, the person who tested negative in the antigen test should also undergo the RT-PCR test, the ICMR itself said.
However, ICMR had said in its instructions that these tests should be done with the help of accurate and reliable testing kits as there is no other reliable option for speedy testing.
These cells attach to the antigens that have entered the body.
It contains antibodies made in the blood cells to kill the virus.
These tests are used to take blood samples from people and detect corona-fighting antibodies if they are infected.
Although the number of corona patients was increasing in Pune city during the lockdown, corona was not widespread in rural areas.
A health survey conducted in Manchar village in Pune district on September 9 and 10 found 207 coronary arthritis patients.
After waking up the lockdown, people are seen walking out without any worries.
The negligence of the administration towards the rural areas is one of the reasons for the increase in corona, says Jawalkar.
Corona is still not taken as seriously as it should be.
Therefore, they are more likely to infect other members of the household than I do.
After the unlock, many transactions started and the number of people going to Pune for work increased.
We have a large proportion of citizens working in the industrial area near Pune as well as in the medical field.
It mainly examined whether anyone had symptoms of corona.
The survey received a good response and many people were found to be coronary, the former sarpanch said.
So there was a fear of corona infection in the village.
Therefore, these villages have been declared hotspots.
If there are more than 15 patients and local transmission is seen, the gram panchayat is considered a hotspot.
Five National Highways pass through Pune.
So far 892 patients have died.
According to doctors, parents and everyone in the family should be aware of the symptoms of this infection after Kovid-19.
Fourteen children were admitted to Wadia Hospital with the disease.
More than 700 children suffering from covid-19 were treated at Wadia Hospital.
Therefore, parents and adults should take care of their children.
Inflammation of the blood vessels starts.
Therefore, children do not have many symptoms.
It affects the intestines, heart, brain and kidneys.
Therefore, parents should be alert and not panic.
Also, if the child has red tongue or red scars on the body, go to the doctor immediately. "
Scientists have yet to find concrete evidence of this.
There is a high fever.
The tongue looks like a strawberry.
However, 8227 children up to 10 years of age in Maharashtra were infected with corona by July.
But it does not have an immediate effect on the heart.
Lockdown in the state is also being phased out.
They do not get corona infection.
Therefore, the government should set up a special Covid-19 center for children.
We should look at this as a warning sign.
I had body aches for a few days.
Speaking to BBC Marathi, he said, "I didn't think it was corona because of diarrhea.
Some cases of corona infection have been reported in the state in patients with abdominal pain and diarrhea.
A few days later, his corona test came back positive.
Prashant Salve (MD Medicine) told BBC Marathi, "About 5% of patients with diarrhea in OPD are coming for check-up.
Therefore, it is too late to test the corona and start treatment on it.
The sore throat stops and after a few days there is diarrhea.
Even now, the doctors providing medical services in Covid-19 ward are telling us to get tested in time.
Even so, the superintendent of Sion Hospital, Dr. Ramesh Bharmal said.
But to some extent, patients with these symptoms are being hospitalized.
If abdominal pain and fever are accompanied by diarrhea, corona should be tested without any confusion."
But in the rest of the country, doctors are advised to be vigilant even if the general public sees any disease.
From the respiratory system to the nose, throat to lungs are all corona receptors.
So the virus can reach other organs in the body.
But doctors treating corona patients say that the corona virus can enter any part of the body.
Patients with diarrhea were diagnosed with swine flu.
Therefore, diarrhea does not necessarily mean corona infection.
With this in mind, contact your doctor immediately in such a situation.
Did you have diarrhea after that?
Ever since reading and writing about Corona, Johns Hopkins University has taken a look at statistics.
India's corona graph looked a little different.
Does this mean that India's corona graph is improving?
But the risk of corona has decreased, it should not be taken to mean that."
Patients have not been properly traced, which may be the reason behind this.
According to ICMR, over nine and a half lakh tests were conducted in the last one day.
We have to look at how many rapid tests were done in the past and what the number is now."
This test is especially important for patients with symptoms.
But if all the tests are done RT-PCR, even though this number is less, it will give accurate statistics.
On September 16, about 10 lakh 9 thousand tests were conducted in India.
But it should be noted that the recovery rate increases only because the test is reduced.
Apart from that, we are also keeping an eye on the state figures.
If it continues to fall for a few days in a row, it doesn't matter if the graph improves.
This will not create a shortage of doctors.
The results of the second CIRO survey will be released soon, the government said.
Therefore, the government once again said that this is our success.
Corona can spread more during this time, so people need to be more careful. K. Paul said.
The society has found that some people have entered the market to make a net profit and their products are not of good quality.
Sanitizer is the shield you have to defend against the enemy in the battle against Covid-19.
Therefore, many products have started appearing in the market under the name of Sanitizer.
Does your skin have a sanitizer suit?
The sanitizers were taken from Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai for investigation.
45 samples were found to be adulterated.
It is widely used despite the ban on the use of methyl alcohol.
It can affect the skin, eyes, and lungs.
Methyl alcohol is used in companies that make plastics, polyesters, solvents.
This can lead to injury.
Therefore, citizens need to take special care while buying sanitizer from any shop.
There is a formula of World Health Organization for sanitizer.
The Center has called for all the information.
The expiration date should be clearly stated, the manufacturer's license number should be clearly mentioned.
It is better if the ethyl alcohol content in the sanitizer is more than 70 per cent.
To do this, take a tablespoon of wheat flour and add sanitizer.
Kamath goes on to say, I have received 4-5 threatening phone calls after we reported on sanitizers.
Garba or Dandiya will not be organized in Navratra this year.
The height of the domestic idol of the goddess should be less than 2 feet while the height of the idol of the goddess in the public circle should be less than 4 feet.
If there is a clay idol of Shadu, it should be immersed at home.
Voluntary donations or donations for the festival should be accepted.
However, Aditya Thackeray said, "We plan to open the locals to all by mid-October."

The central government will have to provide Rs 80,000 crore to make the vaccine reach every Indian.
'Can your government provide Rs 80,000? Sir, Thali, Tali, power outage, 21 days, 93 thousand 379 deaths .. '
Pune has become the city with the most active cases, surpassing Mumbai and Delhi.
Which contains 57,460 active cases.
Six months later, on August 24, the city received its first Jumbo Covid Hospital.
By then, 1.5 lakh positive cases had been registered in Pune.
There were many complaints about the management.
The administration cracked down on the agency that got the job of the jumbo center and handed over all the arrangements to the new agency.
That's how we sent the patients.
But for a specific case, we cannot say what happened in that case.
CCTV cameras have been installed in all the wards inside.
400 to 500 beds are operational so far.
The capacity will be increased soon, but the municipality claims that it has met the need for 800 beds for the city.
We did 100 beds with him at Dalvi Hospital.
The nurses working in the ICU were called from there, "says Rubel Agarwal.
A room has been set up here for the relatives of the patients.
Relatives did not understand how their person was doing.
But now there are tabs in this new room.
According to him, the system is now smooth but Punekars need to show restraint and get treatment in time.
And in most cases, there is a situation where nothing can be done.
However, stories of how the thresholds of hospitals have been eroded to get beds can be heard everywhere in Pune.
But his relatives, who were serious, somehow got beds.
We went to several hospitals.
Although the number of preparation beds on the online dashboard appears to be large, the number of critical beds available is declining.
There are 75 such ventilator ICU beds in the district.
A government hospital like Sassoon has 450 beds.
Cities like Mumbai and Delhi were setting up jumbo hospitals in May, but Pune was waiting for disaster.
From the very beginning, he was writing letters to the government on issues related to Corona, also on social media.
In May, we have pre-determined priorities.
After that, whether it was 800 beds or 400 beds.
They have 400 beds.
But at the same time, what did you use your previous experience in treating 800 patients?
Yet only 50 percent of the capacity is operational.
According to him, the decision was taken immediately, but there are some questions about the city.
This is a plus point and 80 per cent of the private beds have been taken over or the policy has been adopted.
I had called all the hospitals.
Pune is not limited to one district.
Even though the first patient was registered on March 9, Pune's figures will be moderate till June.
There are some reasons why social discrimination and wearing of masks are not followed.
According to Dr. Pradeep Awate, Chief Survey Officer of the state, the weather in Pune should also be the reason behind this infection.
It is conducive to the growth of this virus.
Pune alone has conducted 6.5 lakh tests so far.
There is NIV in Pune.
This is more than Mumbai, says Dr. Awate.
The Mumbai Municipal Corporation on Thursday (October 1) released the figures of the second CIRO survey conducted in three divisions of the city.
A CIRO survey is conducted to find out how many people have been infected in which areas.
The second CIRO survey was conducted at the end of September.
Taking care will help prevent corona infection. "
The survey examined health post, clinics, health offices and field staff.
The health workers went door-to-door for the check-up.
Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank informed about this.
The school education ministers of various states want to implement it.
Millions of students took the exams as per the rules.
Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank has appealed to implement the guidelines keeping in view the need for both security and education.
However, some rules and regulations have been announced for it.
Also, on the other hand, online, digital method should be implemented as a pilot project immediately, said Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.
About 70% of students worldwide have been affected by this global outbreak and lockdown.
The number of patients in Mumbai and Pune is not decreasing.
Schools in areas where corona infection is under control, as well as where the number of patients is low, can start relatively early.
But like all other non-academic responsibilities, teachers are demanding that the entire responsibility for preventing corona virus infection in schools should not be placed on teachers.
There needs to be clarity at the government level.
There are small classrooms and two students sit on one bench.
The education department has not held a single simple meeting on what to prepare for starting the school.
There is a classroom of 400 square feet.
As a result, lockdowns remain and restrictions on schools and colleges remain.
Schools in Sikkim are also expected to start in July.
Along with education, social distance will also be important.
Covid-19 infection is also spreading in rural areas.
However, despite the outbreak of the corona virus in the state, the state's Mahavikas Aghadi government seems reluctant to fill vacancies in the health sector.
Corona is spreading like wildfire in the state.
The government always promises to fill the vacancies in the health department.
However, three months later, no concrete decision has been taken.
We are working to fill the vacancies as soon as possible.
But, will this reservation be delayed due to Maratha reservation?
Discussions are underway on the impact of Maratha reservation in filling up vacancies.
People with less experience and educational qualifications are given important responsibilities.
These vacancies should be filled immediately.
Pune has the highest number of active corona patients in the state.
The state of health care in the state seems to have been left in the lurch by the government.
The government compiled statistics on how much manpower the public health department has.
The administration will take appropriate action in the future as well."
We are recruiting doctors and nurses through walk-in interviews.
A few days ago, the nurses of the medical college, who were suffering due to work stress, insufficient manpower and non-filling of vacancies, had taken up the cause of agitation.
We want to set up an independent directorate for nurses.
This space needs to be filled at the right time.
A few days ago, nurses in government hospitals took up the issue.
The court has ordered the government to fill the vacancy within two weeks, said Chaitanya Dharurkar.
A decision on this will be taken soon."
A competent public health system is the backbone of the state.
But, no government has taken it seriously.
The Supreme Court ruled in 2020-21 that there was no reservation for Marathas in jobs and education.
According to health experts, the Maharashtra government spends only 0.50 per cent (half a per cent) of its gross domestic product on health.
But, what happened next? Expenditure on health sector has increased.
However, the government has always given secondary importance to the health sector.
Fed up with the situation, folk artist and dancer Visakha Kale has taken the last step.
But she had an accident a few months ago.
Gupteswar Pandey's name is not in it.
Gupteswar Pandey had repeatedly refuted speculations of entering politics after taking over the VRC as Bihar's director general of police.
Overall, it was certain that he would get a nomination from the JDU.
The N-95 mask will be available for around Rs 19 to Rs 50 depending on the type, while the double and triple layer masks will be available for just Rs three to four.
Concerns were raised about the growing number of patients in Pune.
In addition, many patients were having difficulty getting beds.
The situation is similar in Pimpri Chinchwad area.
During this period, it was observed that the spread of corona increased due to congestion in the markets as well as citizens visiting relatives.
A month later, as per the October 11 data, the number of positive patients in Pune had come down to 14 per cent, while in Pimpri-Chinchwad it had come down to 11 per cent.
In this, the pathogens are less active for some time.
This shows a reduction in the lethality of the corona virus.
This could also reduce the number of patients.
To this question, Bhondwe said, "Now Dussehra and Diwali are the festivals.
It is necessary to go. If the patient of Corona gets treatment early, he will recover soon, ”says Bhondwe.
That number has now come down to 4 to 5 thousand.
The positive rate was around 30 per cent in September, but now it has come down to 15 per cent.
Citizens who have other ailments are being identified and tested and treated.
The second wave may come in December-January.
As many as 6626 tests were carried out on this day, while 41 civilians were killed.
On October 11, 697 new coronavirus patients were found in Pune, while 4788 tests were performed on this day.
Total number of patients in Pimpri Chinchwad on the same day
In Pimpri Chinchwad, 1432 people have died so far.
The fitness industry is one of them.
But still many states have not started gyms, yoga classes, fitness studios or training centers.
After five months of shutting down the means of income, it became clear that they could no longer sit idly by, and some began to think of ways to turn the crisis into an opportunity.
Boxing training is given at his club, Cadiz Boxing Academy.
I did not think that this would be possible due to the growing contagion of corona in Mumbai and the government's regulations in this regard.
We waited for a month or two for the lockdown to come up.
In online coaching, that number has almost halved.
My father was also a boxer.
Our club's players also played for the state championship.
One batch for children under fifteen and two batches for older children.
Now there is no cost of equipments.
So there are limitations to online training.
We had to run on what was saved.
Students from Satara, Nandurbar, Nashik and Nanded have also registered.
Starting from Samarth Gymnasium in Dadar and later from Maharashtra Kabaddi Association, batches of this academy are running in Dadar, Andheri and Thane today.
And throughout the year, Covid hit.
But realizing that the Corona crisis would not go away, Varsha decided to start classes online.
So they took a zoom meeting of all the coaches in the academy and decided on a training program.
But the girls were very enthusiastic, so things got easier.
There are other examples like Varsha Upadhyay or Krishna Das who have taken new paths.
But they did not show much interest.
There are no other part-time jobs.
Of course, at present Bhushan takes care of the machines himself.
In the fight against covid-19, remedivir is considered to be the only weapon in the hands of doctors to save the lives of patients in such a situation.
Therefore, the World Health Organization studied whether remedivir is used to reduce deaths due to covid-19.
This study has yet to be peer-reviewed.
However, the interim findings do not reduce the mortality rate or the need for ventilators in hospitalized patients.
In Maharashtra, remedivir is being given to those suffering from moderate to severe ailments.
Therefore, they will be consulted in consultation with the WHO report.
Demand for this specialty has grown significantly as a result of recent corporate scandals.
In that context, the study of the World Health Organization is very important.
The shortage is due to increased demand.
The study does not show a reduction in the number of deaths from acute diseases.
Speaking about this, Dr. Rahul Pandit says, "Remedacivir is currently being given to critically ill patients.
From April onwards, doctors began prescribing remedivir to coronary artery disease.
There is no benefit in giving remedesivir to a patient in the second stage, which is the second week.
There may be differing opinions as to whether it is beneficial or not.
In 2014, remedivir was found to be effective against Ebola, which was found in Africa.
Remedivir prevents the corona virus from growing in the body of the coronavirus and helps to reduce the number of viruses in the body.
In an interview with BBC Marathi correspondent Nilesh Dhotre, he shared his views on the Mumbai Police, Deepika Padukone's inquiry and the Sushant Singh Rajput case.
The doubling of the number of coronaviruses in Mumbai is 144 days, while in Pune it is 197 days.
The recovery rate of the state has gone up to 90 per cent.
Unlock and festive days, with a large number of people coming out, experts have predicted a second wave of corona.
However, after Ganeshotsav, the number of Kovid-19 patients in the city increased significantly.
We have to be vigilant for the next three months.
But, the health system in the country was claimed to be more efficient than before.
Speaking to the BBC, state health minister Rajesh Tope said:
Maharashtra's mortality rate is 2.63 per cent, the health minister said.
The government intends to launch Mumbai's Jeevanvahini local train for the common man in a few days.
Patients died at the gates of municipal hospitals like KEM, Sion.
"In a metropolis like Mumbai, the number of corona victims has stabilized.
So if people take care of themselves during the Covid era, we can definitely face another wave.
Speaking on the occasion, the head of the state government's Covid-19 task force, Dr. Sanjay Oak says, "We have hospitals, field hospitals have been set up.
We have to be prepared for that.
So 21 coronary victims died.
Speaking on the occasion, Pune Mayor Muralidhar Mohol said, "A central team that visited Pune last month has predicted a second wave of corona in December.
The death toll has risen to 6657.
So now the situation is under control and the administration is ready to face the situation that may arise in the future, he said.
Healthcare was not enough to prevent infection.
At present, 90 per cent beds are available for corona patients.
The recovery rate is 92 per cent, the administration said.
It is not possible to say for sure whether the second wave will come or not.
On September 11, 24,886 corona-infected patients were found in the state.
The number of patients who need oxygen and ventilator is projected.
French President Emmanuel Macron has announced a second lockdown in the country.
Restaurants, bars will remain closed, while schools and factories will remain open.

This wave is going to be more terrible than the first, there is no doubt about it, Macron said.
Schools should be started after Diwali, but with proper precautions
The next few days after Diwali need to be more vigilant.
The local administration should decide whether the schools in such places can be started in an alternative space.
The Chief Minister has also appealed to the parents not to send the child who is ill or the person in the household who is ill to school.
There will be a four-hour school in which only difficult subjects like science, mathematics and English will be taught.
But some private schools went to court against it.
We will investigate and take action, the school education minister assured.
Therefore, the question before the government is how long the admission should be postponed.
In the next two days, he will discuss law and justice.
This statement of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is very important on the backdrop of Diwali.
People who have been sitting at home for seven-eight months in a row on the back of a corona are now going out for shopping.
But there is a feeling that we are safe by wearing face masks.
Droplets formed by wearing a mask get stuck in the mask or stopped in the mask.
This puts others at risk as well.
How safe are masks?
The average mortality rate in the state is 2.63 per cent.
These include the use of masks, hygiene, and distance.
Consumers are wearing masks but not enough distance is maintained.
Using a mask reduces the risk of sneezing or coughing up sneezes from the nose or mouth.
But in crowded places, the chances are slim.
Due to the crowd, four wheelers had to be banned.
Therefore, there is a possibility of numerous people in the crowd.
Some people are seen wearing masks around their necks.
The mask should cover the nose and mouth.
This requires frequent sanitizing.
Dr. Chaudhary says, "You should not touch your eyes when you go out, especially when you are in a crowd.
However, the state government has warned people not to forget that the Corona era is not over.
Also don’t go out of your way to understand your moral responsibility unless you feel good.
Cotton is a fabric that does not undergo filtration.
Surgical masks do not infect both the inside and the outside.
Therefore, the use of this mask is said to be harmful in the fight against the corona virus.
So that the particles of pollution do not enter the body while breathing.
Where you have to work for 4-5 hours wearing a PPE kit.
This mask does not feel too hot.
So that no other healthy person will be infected. "
These masks do not contain carbon dioxide inside the mask.
Punitive action is being taken if the mask is not used.
A fine of Rs 4 crore 79 lakh has been collected till November 7.
But these rules do not seem to be enforced everywhere.
The state health department has sent a letter to the municipal corporation, district collector and health officials instructing them on what to do in case of another wave of Covid-19 in the state.
Against this backdrop, Health Minister Rajesh Tope had suggested that citizens in Maharashtra should be cautious.
At least 140 tests should be done every day for a population of one million.
The general public should be informed about this.
People should be surveyed through fever clinic.
Oxygen should be properly controlled.
People need to be informed about this.
Patients suffering from diabetes, hypertension need guidance.
As a result, a large number of people have gone out for work on Diwali.
This has made doctors a little worried.
Therefore, fever patients will be surveyed.
However, on November 11, the number doubled to 1,069.
Accordingly, online darshan facility has also been made available in some of the temples.
Some temple administrations appealed to the government, while others met opposition leaders.

Deepika Deshmukh from Akola has brought a new 'sunrise' in the lives of many housewives through her home industry.
While the family was running smoothly, her husband's illness raised the question of subsistence.
Due to her illness, Deepika took the lead in the bicycle repair business.

Health Minister Rajesh Tope had told BBC Marathi while talking about WHO's findings in October that a decision on the use of Remedisivir would be taken after talking to the Covid Task Force and other experts about the findings of HO's research.

Because of the critical situation in Delhi, we are taking more care.
The lockdown has been repeated in Europe.

I am giving you instructions as we are on the verge of danger - Uddhav Thackeray
There are a lot of side effects after covid.
There is no need to legislate on everything.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray informed Prime Minister Narendra Modi about this.
He had won the assembly elections first from the independents, second from the Congress party and third from the NCP.
After that, he overcame it with timely treatment.
In the last few days, Bharat Bhalke's health was critical.
Therefore, the work of the courts can be resumed now.
Therefore, this instruction has been given to other courts across the state except Pune.
Sanitizers as well as other safety devices should be available in court.
But neither Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari nor Leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis will be present to welcome him.
But because of his studies, Corona is scared of both of them, said Ajit Pawar at this time.
He had to lose his left arm due to gangrene.
After examining the doctor, the doctor said that he had contracted a disease called cellulitis.
He recently had surgery on both his legs.
In such a situation, there is a big financial crisis to run the house.
At that time, Labor Officer Sudhakar Challawad had promised to provide proper help in this regard.
He told BBC Marathi that Kolhapur Municipal Corporation has immediately started paying Rs. 2200 as disability allowance to Bajirao Sathe.
As per the government order, the patient can get help of Rs 3 lakh.
After that, the government will pay for their treatment, said Challawad.
From this, if Bajirao Sathe wants, this job will be given to his successor, said Challawad.
The number of corona victims in Maharashtra has crossed the 18 lakh mark.
Business, trade and tourism have started to accelerate the economic cycle.
So don't be complacent, said Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, who warned that the next few days could be dangerous.
Knowing this situation, the state government should have paid attention from the very beginning in terms of corona ban, said Maharashtra President of the Indian Medical Association, Dr. Expressed by Avinash Bhondwe.
Despite this, the government did not take precautionary measures.
The government claims to have stopped corona in Maharashtra.
Health workers have visited people's homes two or three times.
We see how the Thackeray government's report card is in the 'Corona' exam.
The virus is highly contagious, spreading rapidly around the world.
On the one hand, the patient was growing.
However, PPE kits, masks were not properly planned till May.
However, there has never been a shortage of these essential items in municipal hospitals."

8,000 beds will be available in the coming weeks," he told reporters on May 30.
The number of oxygen support beds is 28,767.
The number of beds available became public.
They did not know what to do?
To treat the growing number of patients, the government acquired 80 per cent of private hospital beds for Covid-19.
Ignoring these instructions completely, the government took beds from all private hospitals, said Maharashtra President of the Indian Medical Association, Dr. Called Avinash Bhondwe.
The hospital did not have doctors, nurses, health workers.
Who treats corona patients in this hospital?
However, doctors regret that they did not trust the doctor when deciding on a medical policy.
The doctors were not given much consideration in the decision-making process from the beginning.
In order to fight a disease like corona, it was necessary to make a decision in consultation with the doctors to formulate a medical policy.
This made the government machinery look confused, says Bhondwe.
Hospitals other than KEM, Sion and Nair in Mumbai have never been looked after.
The budget for health is very small.
The government's decision to set up a 5,000-bed hospital for infectious diseases is welcome.
Many of these were also affected.
A large number of patients were admitted to government hospitals.
Stopped looting from private hospitals.
Reduced the cost of the drug
The government has controlled the prices of masks.
Through Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, he remained permanently connected to the people as the Chief Minister.
He explains the information calmly.
However, in the last two months, Uddhav Thackeray has not made any concrete decisions or policies.
He started his efforts by acknowledging that another wave of corona would come.
