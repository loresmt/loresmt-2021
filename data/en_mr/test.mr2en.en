COVID-19 is an illness that can affect your lungs and airways, and sometimes other parts of your body.
It’s caused by a virus called coronavirus.
COVID-19 is highly infectious.
It spreads through the air through droplets produced when people cough or sneeze, or when they touch surfaces where the droplets have landed and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth.
COVID-19 can cause serious illness, hospitalisation and even death.
Common symptoms of COVID-19 include:
A fever (high temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or above)
A new cough (this can be any kind of cough, not just dry)
Shortness of breath or breathing difficulties
loss or change to your sense of smell or taste – this means you’ve noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or they smell or taste differently
You may not have all of these symptoms or you may just feel generally less well than usual.
It can take up to 14 days for symptoms to show.
They can be similar to symptoms of cold or flu.
If you have any symptoms of COVID-19, self-isolate (stay in your room) and phone a Doctor (GP).
They can arrange a COVID-19 test for you.
Who is most at risk from COVID-19?
People 65 years of age or older people and people with certain health conditions have a higher risk of getting seriously ill if they get COVID-19.
What is the COVID-19 vaccine?
A vaccine is a substance that should improve. immunity (protection) to a particular disease.
The COVID-19 vaccine will offer you protection from COVID-19.
If people are vaccinated, it should also reduce the numbers who become seriously ill or even die from COVID-19 in our community.
Vaccines teach your immune system how to protect you from diseases.
It is much safer for your immune system to learn how to protect you through vaccination than by getting COVID-19.
Who should get the vaccine?
A list of priority groups can be found at: www.gov.ie/covid19vaccine
While it is up to you to decide to get the vaccine, the HSE, the World Health Organization and the Department of Health strongly recommend that you do so as soon as it is offered to you.
Vaccines will be given as the supply arrives in Ireland.
When it’s your turn, we will let you know how to get your vaccine through advertising or direct invitation.
It is important not to contact the HSE for a vaccination before then.
You will need to read this leaflet and the manufacturer’s Patient Information Leaflet before you get the vaccine.
You can view the ‘Manufacturers Pest Information Information Leaflet’ at www.hse.ie/covid19vaccinePIL var.
You can also talk to a healthcare professional in advance.
If you decide to get the vaccine, you will give your consent which will be recorded.
The HSE is offering the vaccine free of charge.
Why is it important to get the COVID-19 vaccine?
Getting a COVID-19 vaccine should reduce your risk of getting COVID-19 and protect you from serious complications of the illness.
Our aim in offering the vaccine to the population is to protect people and reduce the illness and deaths caused by this virus.
I already had COVID-19, so do I need to get the vaccine?
Yes.
Even if you have already had COVID-19, you could still get it again.
The vaccine will reduce your risk of getting COVID-19 again.
Even if you do get COVID-19 again, the vaccine can reduce the seriousness of your symptoms.
I have COVID-19 now, should I get the vaccine?
You should delay getting vaccinated until you recover from COVID-19.
Do this for:
at least four weeks after you first notice symptoms or four weeks since you tested positive for COVID-19
Getting the vaccine
Who is my vaccinator?
They are trained by the HSE to give COVID-19 vaccines.
Can the COVID-19 vaccine give you COVID-19?
No, the Covid-19 vaccine does not make you infected with Covid-19.
It is possible to have caught COVID-19 before getting your vaccine and not realise you have the symptoms until after your vaccination appointment.
If you have any symptoms of COVID-19, it is important to self-isolate (stay in your room) and arrange a free test to find out if you have COVID-19.
If you have a fever which starts more than two days after you get the vaccine, or lasts longer than two days, you should self-isolate and ask a Doctor (GP) to arrange a COVID-19 test for you.
If you have COVID-19 symptoms after the first dose, you still need to have the second dose.
While you may get some protection from the first dose, having the second dose will give you the best protection against the virus.
Should I get the COVID-19 vaccine if I have a high temperature?
No.
You should delay getting the vaccine if you have a fever (temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or above), until you feel better.
Is it safe to get the vaccine if pregnant or breastfeeding?
There’s no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine is unsafe if you’re pregnant.
COVID-19 vaccines were not tested on pregnant women in the clinical trials.
If If you are a health worker or in a high-risk group and you are pregnant, you should talk to your Obstetrician or Doctor (GP) about getting the COVID-19 vaccine.
You can get the COVID-19 vaccine if you are breastfeeding.
What vaccine am I being offered?
The vaccine we are offering you is called Comirnaty, manufactured by Pfizer/BioNTech.
This mRNA vaccine teaches your body how to make a protein that will trigger an immune response, without using the live virus that causes COVID-19.
Your body then makes antibodies that help fight the infection if the COVID-19 virus enters your body in the future.
Is the vaccine safe?
The HSE only uses vaccines when they meet the required standards of safety and effectiveness.
While the work to develop COVID-19 vaccines has moved much faster than usual. 
The vaccine we are offering you has gone through all the usual steps needed to develop and approve a safe and effective vaccine.
In order to be approved for use, the COVID-19 vaccine went through all the clinical trials and safety checks all other licensed medicines go through, following international standards of safety.
The vaccine we are offering you is called Comirnaty, manufactured by Pfizer/BioNTech.
It has been tested with thousands of people as part of clinical trials.
Met strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness, and been approved and licensed by regulators.
The regulator for Ireland is the European Medicines Agency (EMA) - visit www.ema.europa.eu for more information.
How is the COVID-19 vaccine given?
The COVID-19 vaccine is given as an injection into your upper arm.
It will only take a few minutes.
How many doses of the COVID-19 vaccine will I need?
You will need two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to get the best protection.
You need to get the second dose 28 days (four full weeks) after the first dose.
What are the side effects of the vaccine?
Like all medicines, vaccines can cause side effects.
Most of these are mild to moderate, short-term, and not everyone gets them.
More than one in 10 people may experience:
feeling tired
tenderness or swelling in your arm where you have had the vaccine injection
headache
muscle pain
joint pain
diarrhoea
fever (temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or above)
More than 1 in 1,000 people will develop itchiness where the vaccine was given, generalised itchiness, a rash, swelling of the lymph glands or sleeplessness.
Bell’s palsy is a rare side effect seen in more than 1 in 10,000 people.
Serious side effects, like a severe allergic reaction, are extremely rare, seen in approximately 1 in 100,000 people.
Your vaccinator is trained to treat very rare serious allergic reactions.
People who have had facial fillers can sometimes have swelling on their face.
It is found in more than 1 in 10,000 people.
The COVID-19 vaccine has gone through the same clinical trials and safety checks as all other licensed vaccines.
However the vaccine is new and long-term side effect information is limited.
As more people in Ireland and around the world get this vaccine, more information on side effects may become available.
The HSE will update this information regularly on our website, and if necessary, will update the information leaflets given to people at their first or second dose of the vaccine.
Fever after the vaccine
It’s quite common to develop a fever after a vaccination.
Usually, this happens within two days (48 hours) of getting the vaccine, and it goes away within two days.
You are more likely to get a fever after your second dose of the vaccine.
If you feel uncomfortable, take paracetamol or ibuprofen as directed on the box or leaflet.
If you are concerned, please seek medical advice.
Are there some people who should not get the COVID-19 vaccine?
You should not get the COVID-19 vaccine if:
you have had a severe allergic reaction to any of the ingredients in the vaccine (including polyethylene glycol).
Read the 'manufacturer’s Patient Information Leaflet' to see the list of ingredients.
you have had a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine.
If you have had an immediate allergic reaction to any other vaccine, injectable therapy or polysorbate 80, you should talk to your Doctor before getting the COVID-19 vaccine.
Most people will be able to safely get the vaccine.
The person giving you the vaccine will be happy to answer any questions you have at your appointment for the vaccine.
They will also give you an aftercare advice leaflet.
And a vaccine record card showing the name and batch number of the vaccine you have been given.
How long does it take the vaccine to work?
After having both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, most people will have immunity.
This means they will be protected against COVID-19.
It takes 7 days after getting the second dose for it to work.
There is a chance you might still get COVID-19, even if you have the vaccine.
Does the vaccine work in everyone?
Worldwide, vaccines save at least 2 to 3 million lives each year, and protect many more from lifelong illnesses.
Millions of people have now received COVID-19 vaccines all over the world.
There’s strong, reliable evidence that COVID-19 vaccines greatly reduce your risk of getting COVID-19.
They’re highly effective at preventing deaths and serious illness with COVID-19.
If you have a weakened immune system, there is no extra risk in taking the vaccine but it may not work as well for you.
When I get the vaccine, does that mean I won’t spread COVID-19 to others.
We do not know yet if having the vaccine stops you spreading the COVID-19 virus to others.
That is why it is important that we all continue to follow public health advice on how to stop the spread of the virus.
In particular, you still need to:
Follow social distancing guidelines (keep two metres apart from others where possible)
Wear a face covering
Wash your hands regularly
Thank you for protecting yourself and others.
How long does immunity last from the vaccine?
We do not know yet how long immunity will last.
Clinical trials are ongoing to find this out.

How do I report side effects.
As with all vaccines, you can report suspected side effects to the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA).
The HPRA is the regulatory authority in the Republic of Ireland for medicines, medical devices and other health products.
HPRA on drug safety monitoring
As part of its role in the safety monitoring of medicines, the HPRA operates a system through which healthcare professionals or members of the public can report any suspected adverse reactions (side effects) associated with medicines and vaccines which have occurred in Ireland.
The HPRA strongly encourages reporting of suspected adverse reactions (side effects) associated with COVID-19 vaccines to support continuous monitoring of their safe and effective use.
Please visit www.hpra.ie/report to report any suspicious adverse reactions to the Covid-19 vaccine.
You can also ask your Doctor or a family member to report this for you.
As much information as is known should be provided, and where possible, the vaccine batch number should be included.
The HPRA cannot provide clinical advice on individual cases.
Members of the public should contact their healthcare professional (their Doctor or Pharmacist) with any medical concerns they may have.
After your Comirnaty (Pfizer / BioNTech) Covid-19 vaccination
Thank you for keeping yourself and others safe until vaccination.
We recommend that you read this documentation carefully once you have been vaccinated, as this will help you understand how the next few days will affect you and where to find out more.
You should read the information given to you today.
We are also giving you today's vaccination record.
Please keep the record card safe.
What could happen in the next few days?
Some people who have been vaccinated will experience the following symptoms:
Feeling soft or swollen on the vaccinated arm.
Muscle pain
Diarrhea
Fever (temperature 38 से C or higher)
As with any vaccination, you can report your side effects to the Health Product Regulatory Authority (HPRA).

If you have a fever for more than 48 hours, you can contact a doctor.
Do not take ibuprofen if you are pregnant
Do I need to do anything before taking the second dose of vaccination?
If you are taking the second or last dose of the vaccine, let the vaccination team know about any changes you have noticed in your health before.
Carry a report card with you when you go for a second dose of the vaccine.
This will happen in the next 28 days (4 weeks)
The good news
The Covid 19 vaccine will protect you from the serious consequences of Covid 19.
The vaccine will stimulate your immune system to fight off the disease.
Vaccination is safer for your immune system than transmission of Covid 19.
We are still learning.
It takes effect 7 days after the second dose of the vaccine.
Even after getting vaccinated, there is a slight chance that you will get Covid 19 infection.
We don't yet know if we can spread the virus to other people if we stop taking the vaccine, so we should follow public health advice.
Follow the social distance (keep a distance of 2 meters from others)
Wearing a mask
Wash hands regularly

Also for ILI and SARI should be monitored by health system and fever clinics.
This should include those who come in contact with family, people in the area, workplace and other reasons.
The incidence of positive patients should be less than 5% of the total number of tests.
Containment zones should be created based on the number of patients, their contact tracing, digital mapping.
When isolating a person at home, care should be taken to ensure that the Centre's instructions are followed.
This should be thoroughly investigated and at the same time complete genome sequencing should be done.
Steps should be taken in this regard.
Therefore, the district administration should focus on implementing strict and effective measures as per the guidelines of the Central Health Department.
So the hidden ones keep taking canosa to deceive him.
Such a question should be asked.
If we look at the history of infectious diseases, it is often the second wave that spreads the disease and the rate at which people get sick.
Let us learn through some graphics.
After that the number of patients gradually decreased.
It shows how the daily patient population has increased in the last three months.
This is the largest one-day increase in Maharashtra so far.
Now with the second wave, the number of patients is increasing again in urban areas like Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur.
The figure reached 6,740 on February 25.
Many people went to the villages to cast their votes and the number of travels also increased.
Experts also say that the number is rising again due to the delay in taking care of people after the first wave of Kovid's epidemic subsided.
But Maharashtra currently has 60 per cent covid patients in the country.
There are 1 lakh 66 thousand 353 patients from Maharashtra alone.
Out of which 23 lakh 29 thousand 464 or about twenty percent of the patients are from Maharashtra.
Kerala ranks ninth in this list.
As on December 24, 2020, 1 lakh 28 thousand 820 investigations were being conducted in the state.
Speaking to the BBC, experts have expressed concern over this.
This means that although the number of patients is increasing, the death toll is much lower than in the first wave.
In a few days in September, the death toll had crossed 400.
As on March 18, 38,04,142 people in Maharashtra were vaccinated.
Experts say that mutations are not responsible for the mutations in the virus.
But the chromosomes of that cell tell us exactly what changes are taking place.
In January, a group of genome scientists said that "there are 14 million cases in India but only 6400 of them have been stored".
He also said that action was taken against 20 lakh people in Mumbai who did not wear masks.
10th and 12th class students are excluded from this.
Shopping malls will also be open till 10 p.m.
Regular Pooja, Archana / Cleaning work of this place will be allowed to be done within the limit of presence of maximum 5 persons.
It will be a lockdown until midnight on March 31st.
But during this period, medical services, media offices, sale of milk, sale of vegetables and fruits will continue.
10th and 12th classes were also closed.
The home wedding can be attended by up to 50 people.
However, some strict restrictions have been imposed in the district to curb corona infection.
It has been decided that no mask, no entry method should be implemented.
The customer will have to serve a sealed meal in the room.
This is a night curfew from 11pm to 5am.
But the limits for weddings and funerals will apply there as well.
In it, the commission has issued identity cards.
As a result, the guidelines for giving exams have also changed.
Better to have your own car.
Eating and drinking outside should be avoided as much as possible while going to the center.
Of course, getting into the mix should be avoided.
Social distance should be strictly observed.
Then sit down.
The commission has made it mandatory to wear gloves.
Because everyone like you cares.
During that period, eating and drinking from each other's boxes should be strictly avoided.
Create a kind of biobubble around yourself.
It can then be unlocked over the phone.
However, after the end of the exam, take the road directly home.
After such a big test, the mind is witnessing loose release.
Currently, the number of patients in Maharashtra is increasing rapidly.
But if the students cooperate, it will not put any stress on the administration.
Therefore, supervisors and administration representatives should be assisted from time to time.
He gave this information through Twitter.
Everyone who comes in contact with me should take care and get tested.
He has appealed to the people to follow the rules in the context of Corona.
The corona reported 70 deaths.
Vegetable, fruit and grocery stores will now be open till 4 p.m.
I have come to attend a meeting organized by the district administration to discuss the situation.
As on March 18, 2021, 2,913 patients with coronary heart disease were registered in the city.
The corona also reported 14 deaths in a single day.
As a result, the poor suffer greatly.
The death rate has come down due to increased anti-corona immunity in the population.
Now, even though the number of corona patients is increasing, a large number of patients are undergoing in-home isolation treatment as the immune system of the citizens has increased."
According to the district administration, 15,000 citizens have been tested for corona in the last 24 hours.
The Municipal Corporation's nuisance investigation team is collecting fines from the citizens violating the rules.
Corona vaccination is also being carried out in private hospitals, including government medical colleges in the city - hospitals, Mayo, AIIMS and municipal hospitals.
The situation is critical and health facilities will be inadequate in 15-20 days, the CM said.
I will be talking to an expert in the next 2 days.
Today we will probably reach or surpass the number of 45,000 patients.
The situation in France is fragile.
It is important that we save the lives of the people first.
Some people become infected even after taking both doses of the vaccine.
But one hand does not clap.
Students staged an agitation in Mumbai today to protest the government's decision.
Currently, the number of corona patients in the state is increasing at a record level.
In the last few days, students have taken to the streets in Pune and Nashik for this demand.
Police then rushed to the spot and arrested 15 to 20 students.
At the same time, many students from remote and rural areas say that they have not studied due to many difficulties in online education.
I have explained to them.
You have to take the exam.
The practical examination for Class XII will be held from May 22 to June 10.
After the results of these two examinations, the third supplementary examination will also be held, said Varsha Gaikwad.
After that, the rules of these restrictions were also announced.
So for 10th and 12th exams, relief has been given in these rules.
This year students will be given more time to write papers.
So we are trying to take the exams in a tension free environment as much as possible."
Regarding this, Varsha Gaikwad said, "The number of students appearing for the board exams is more than 30 lakh.
In case of shortage of classes in that school, nearby schools will also be used as centers.
With this in mind, the time for writing papers is being extended, announced Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad.
Also, there will be strict lockdown in the state from 8 pm on Friday to 7 am on Monday, said Minorities Minister Nawab Malik.
Medicine will not be given to those who do not need it.
The number of hospital beds could be reduced if drastic steps are not taken soon.
Last time, the Prime Minister suddenly imposed a lockdown and the workers got stuck.
Against this backdrop, the administration has decided to tighten the restrictions.
He also spoke to several leaders.
This indifference can be dangerous to oneself as well as to others.
There have been similar mini-lockdowns in other places as well.
Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had on Friday warned of a lockdown if citizens do not follow the rules.
Will the government take responsibility if we or anyone in the family gets infected with corona?
So why didn't the education department consider it when there were exceptional circumstances?
So why should we be the only ones risking our lives?
The students who took this exam presented all the above questions while talking to BBC Marathi.
It was only mentioned that there will be exceptions for the board's 10th and 12th examinations.
The exams will be held in April and May and students will get a chance to appear for the exams again in June with certain conditions.
The state has a curfew and a complete lockdown on Saturday and Sunday.
Therefore, the Uddhav Thackeray government seems to be adamant about taking board exams.
There is no clarity in the new government regulations in this regard.
Want to wear hand gloves?
Also, the examination center will be in the school where they are studying or in the junior college.
The Department of Education fears that this will delay the college admission process and postpone the higher academic year.
The students also carried placards and agitated for this demand.
So there are questions and confusion in the minds of the students.
We also met School Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad.
“We expected the government to change the decision of the exams in view of the increasing cases of corona in the state,” she says.
Beds are inadequate.
This will not affect our results and further admissions, will it?
Even young children are now infected with corona.
Why didn't the education department provide various options?
We have to have 55 per cent for admission in medical college.
Because on the basis of this exam, their path to higher education will be open.
Experts say that in such an exceptional situation, it will be a big challenge for millions of children to pass the exam successfully.
Students will go to the examination center for fear of contracting the disease. "
The situation of online education in rural areas is extremely dire.
The subject is not taught / understood and exams have to be written.
But in such exceptional circumstances, it is also being appealed that we should not hold the test.
The system needs to move beyond the 'exam-centric mindset' and consider education.
Can other exam options be considered?
But quality is also important to us.
But we cannot say that students will follow all the rules with full care and caution.
At this time, BBC Marathi interviewed Varsha Gaikwad, the Minister of School Education, on March 31, 2021, a few days ago .
Or if a lockdown is announced in the future, students can take the exam in June."
Therefore, it is necessary to take the exam, she said.
When asked, Varsha Gaikwad said, "I can't answer that.
What to do if internet connection is lost while giving exams to village children?
Many mess boxes are not ready at 6 o'clock.
While some students are demanding that the exam be postponed, some students are also adamant that the exam should be held as per the schedule.
Some students preparing for competitive exams in Pune also contracted corona.
Because if the report is positive, the test cannot be given.
Such fears are also present in the minds of children.
The growing corona is causing fear in the minds of children.
She says that due to restrictions, the boxes are not delivered on time and it is not possible to get the parcels from the hotel.
Many students have no other choice so they stay in Pune for the sake of Nila.
In order to be able to take the exam, the students are studying by taking some medicines without testing while showing symptoms.
Meals started happening in Pune.
Many children have symptoms of corona.
They say that because many are infected with the corona, they will not be able to take the test.
We were also involved in the agitation but the situation was different then.
So if the test is done, the students will go home on their own and the infection will be reduced, he added.
He published a letter in this regard.
Their doctors are taking pain killer pills from their friends.
So the cases may have increased.
An infected student can spread the infection to many.
But the main difference between the first wave of corona and the second wave is the 'vaccine'.
Therefore, in Maharashtra, which accounts for 60 per cent of the active cases in the country, there is a demand that everyone above the age of 25 should be vaccinated.
Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding that the age limit on vaccination be removed and that everyone above the age of 25 be vaccinated.
The Indian Medical Association (IMA), the country's largest body of doctors, has written to the Prime Minister to raise the age limit to 18 years.
Therefore, everyone above 25 years of age should be vaccinated against covid."
For this, they have demanded Rs 1.5 crore more vaccines from the Center.
Shortly afterwards, the central government announced that the age group would be vaccinated from April 1.
The IMA has written a letter to the Prime Minister demanding that everyone over the age of 18 in the country be vaccinated.
It increases a person's immunity, increases the likelihood of herd immunity in society, and reduces the risk of contracting the disease, the IMA said in its letter.
Citing the ongoing vaccination campaign in other developed countries around the world, the central government has said that the current policy of vaccinating the class is the right one.
Vaccination should be given only to those who are at high risk.
If you look at such countries around the world, they have not vaccinated everyone at all.
Their criteria for vaccination are stricter than ours.
Vaccines have been developed all over the world.
That's why people with the disease and those at risk are vaccinated in advance.
When the issue of age limit comes up for discussion, the focus will be on the role of the Prime Minister when such a demand is made.
In it, we see that patients between the ages of 22 and 45 are the most vulnerable.
So we have to work faster.
But have you done the job by vaccinating everyone over the age of 45?
It would be more expensive to vaccinate everyone over the age of 25 right now.
But this question has become not only political but also extreme economic.
In it, he asked for two days to make the right decision.
But in many cities of the state, business class movements are taking place.
Traders in Pune protested on the famous Lakshmi Road with chains and flags.
We decided to agitate.
It made a different announcement in the evening and changed it at night.
An agitation took place in the capital Nagpur today.
They have now demanded the government to open all shops five days a week.
We, the traders, testify that we will take whatever security precautions we take, he said in the statement.
It will also control overcrowding.
Accordingly, the role of the government is expected to be clarified on Friday.
The Chief Minister has said that the business community will seriously consider their demands, but it is not yet clear how to find a way out.
We want to move forward with confidence.
He also advised Saburi in his Facebook Live.
After that, these parties had expressed support for the steps that the government would take.
Raj Thackeray has also taken a press conference and demanded that the shops be allowed to open a few days a week instead of being closed all day.
Yashomati Thakur has written a letter to the Chief Minister requesting him to relax the conditions of restrictions for Amravati district.
Even local protests cannot be ignored.
Three male and one female patient were killed in the incident, Nagpur Police Commissioner Amitesh Kumar said.
The hospital was given the status of a private mini covid hospital.
The patients who escaped from the fire at Well Treat Hospital have been shifted to Government Medical College Hospital and Indira Gandhi Medical College Hospital in Nagpur.
At this time 5 patients were undergoing treatment in ICU.
At this time, Suraj Wankhede, a social worker from the area, was present at the hospital.
3 of these critically ill patients were evacuated due to smoke in the entire ICU room.
Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis has instructed the district collector to help the sick and injured.
I have sympathies with the relatives of the deceased.
On Friday (April 9, 2021), 58,000 new corona patients were found in the state.
Only essential services will continue during this period.
To allay the suspicions of the citizens, the State Department of Relief and Rehabilitation has issued a Code of Common Questions and Answers.
If the rules are not followed, the local administration can take a decision with the permission of the state government
Or you can order home delivery as per the rules
But, you can't sit and eat.
But, you can't sit and eat in a hotel.
Rajkamal Chowk, Irwin Chowk, Panchavati, Jayasthambh, the main bustle of Amravati city, had a sparse crowd of citizens.
All shops are closed except for essential services in the city.
