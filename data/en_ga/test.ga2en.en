What is COVID-19?
COVID-19 is an illness that can affect your lungs and airways, and sometimes other parts of your body.
It’s caused by a virus called coronavirus.
COVID-19 is highly infectious.
It spreads through the air through droplets produced when people cough or sneeze, or when they touch surfaces where the droplets have landed and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth.
COVID-19 can cause serious illness, hospitalisation and even death.
Common symptoms of COVID-19 include:
a new cough – this can be any kind of cough, not just dry
shortness of breath or breathing difficulties
loss or change to your sense of smell or taste – this means you’ve noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or they smell or taste differently
You may not have all of these symptoms or you may just feel generally less well than usual.
It can take up to 14 days for symptoms to show.
They can be similar to symptoms of cold or flu.
If you have any symptoms of COVID-19, self-isolate (stay in your room) and phone a GP (Doctor).
They can arrange a COVID-19 test for you.
Who is most at risk from COVID-19?
Older people and people with certain health conditions have a higher risk of getting seriously ill if they get COVID-19.
What is the COVID-19 vaccine?
A vaccine is a substance that should improve immunity (protection) to a particular disease.
The COVID-19 vaccine will offer you protection from COVID-19.
If people are vaccinated, it should also reduce the numbers who become seriously ill or even die from COVID-19 in our community.
Vaccines teach your immune system how to protect you from diseases.
It is much safer for your immune system to learn how to protect you through vaccination than by getting COVID-19.
Who should get the vaccine?
You can see the list of groups for vaccination on this website: www.gov.ie/covid19vaccine
While it is up to you to decide to get the vaccine, the HSE, the World Health Organization and the Department of Health strongly recommend that you do so as soon as it is offered to you.
Vaccines will be given as the supply arrives in Ireland.
When it’s your turn, we will let you know how to get your vaccine through advertising or direct invitation.
It is important not to contact the HSE for a vaccination before then.
You will need to read this leaflet and the manufacturer’s Patient Information Leaflet before you get the vaccine.
You can find the manufacturer’s Patient Information Leaflet on: www.hse.ie/covid19vaccinePIL
You can also talk to a healthcare professional in advance.
If you decide to get the vaccine, you will give your consent, which will be recorded.
The HSE is offering the vaccine free of charge.
Why is it important to get the COVID-19 vaccine?
Getting a COVID-19 vaccine should reduce your risk of getting COVID-19 and protect you from serious complications of the illness.
Our aim in offering the vaccine to the population is to protect people and reduce the illness and deaths caused by this virus.
I already had COVID-19, so do I need to get the vaccine?
Yes.
Even if you have already had COVID-19, you could still get it again.
The vaccine will reduce your risk of getting COVID-19 again.
Even if you do get COVID-19 again, the vaccine can reduce the seriousness of your symptoms.
I have COVID-19 now, should I get the vaccine?
No.
You should delay getting vaccinated until you recover from COVID-19.
Do this for:
at least four weeks after you first notice symptoms or
four weeks since you tested positive for COVID-19
Getting the vaccine
Who is my vaccinator?
Your vaccinator is the person who gives you your vaccine.
They are trained by the HSE to give COVID-19 vaccines.
Can the COVID-19 vaccine give you COVID-19?
The COVID-19 vaccine cannot give you COVID-19.
It is possible to have caught COVID-19 before getting your vaccine and not realise you have the symptoms until after your vaccination appointment.
If you have any symptoms of COVID-19, it is important to self-isolate (stay in your room) and arrange a free test to find out if you have COVID-19.
If you have a fever which starts more than two days after you get the vaccine, or lasts longer than two days, you should self-isolate and ask a GP (Doctor) to arrange a COVID-19 test for you.
If you have COVID-19 symptoms after the first dose, you still need to have the second dose.
While you may get some protection from the first dose, having the second dose will give you the best protection against the virus.
Should I get the COVID-19 vaccine if I have a high temperature?
You should delay getting the vaccine if you have a fever (temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or above), until you feel better.
Should I get the vaccine if pregnant or breastfeeding?
If you have had your first dose and are breastfeeding, you should get your second dose.
If you have had your first dose and are pregnant, you should get your second dose ideally by 36 completed weeks of pregnancy.
You will be at greater risk of severe illness if you do not get your second dose.
More information is available at www.hse.ie/covidvacpreg
What vaccine am I being offered?
The vaccine we are offering you is called Vaxzevria.
The vaccine is manufactured by AstraZeneca.
This viral vector vaccine contains a harmless version of a different virus (the vector).
This teaches your body how to make a protein that will trigger an immune response.
Your body then makes antibodies that help fight the infection if the COVID-19 virus enters your body in the future.
Is the vaccine safe?
The HSE only uses vaccines when they meet the required standards of safety and effectiveness.
While the work to develop COVID-19 vaccines has moved much faster than usual, the vaccine we are offering you has gone through all the usual steps needed to develop and approve a safe and effective vaccine.
In order to be approved for use, the COVID-19 vaccine went through all the clinical trials and safety checks all other licensed medicines go through, following international standards of safety.
The vaccine we are offering you is called Vaxzevria, manufactured by AstraZeneca.
It has:
been tested with thousands of people as part of clinical trials
met strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness, and been approved and licensed by regulators.
For Ireland, the regulator is the European Medicines Agency (EMA) – visit www.ema.europa.eu for more information.
How is the COVID-19 vaccine given?
The COVID-19 vaccine is given as an injection into your upper arm.
It will only take a few minutes.
Second dose needed between 8 and 12 weeks after the first dose
How many doses of the COVID-19 vaccine will I need?
You will need two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to get longer lasting protection.
You will get the second dose between 8 and 12 weeks after the first dose.
What are the side effects of the vaccine?
Most of these are mild to moderate, short-term, and not everyone gets them.
More than one in 10 people may experience:
feeling tired
tenderness, bruising, pain or itching in the arm where they had the vaccine injection
headache
muscle pain
joint pain
nausea
fever (temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or above)
More than 1 in 100 people may have redness or swelling where they had the injection, diarrhoea, vomiting or a low platelet count (that doesn’t cause any symptoms).
More than 1 in 1000 people may have a reduced appetite, dizziness, sleepiness, sweating, swollen lymph glands or a rash.
Serious side effects, like a severe allergic reaction, are very rare, seen in approximately 1 in 100,000 people.
Your vaccinator is trained to treat very rare serious allergic reactions.
Very rarely 1 in 100,000 people may develop very unusual blood clots with low platelets.
1 in 5 of these people may die.
These blood clots are less likely to be reported after the second dose of the vaccine.
The risk of this very rare condition is higher in younger people.
A very small number of cases of capillary leak syndrome have occured in people after this vaccine.
It is a serious but very rare condition, and can sometimes be fatal.
Your GP, Doctor or vaccinator can advise you on the risks and benefits of getting this vaccine.
The COVID-19 vaccine has gone through the same clinical trials and safety checks as all other licensed vaccines, however the vaccine is new and longterm side effect information is limited.
As more people in Ireland and around the world get this vaccine, more information on side effects may become available.
The HSE will update this information regularly on our website, and if necessary, will update the information leaflets given to people at their first or second dose of the vaccine.
Symptoms of very rare blood clots
Even though the risk of blood clots with low platelets is extremely low, you should know the signs to watch out for.
Get urgent medical help if you get any of these symptoms after the Vaxzevria vaccine:

The very rare blood clots with low platelets were usually reported within 14 days of getting the Vaxzevria vaccine.
Watch out for these symptoms in the weeks after your vaccination.
Symptoms of very rare capillary leak syndrome
Capillary leak syndrome causes fluid to leak from small blood vessels.
Even though the risk of the condition is extremely low, you should know the signs to watch out for.
sudden weight gain
You may also feel faint due to low blood pressure.
Capillary leak syndrome was usually reported within 4 days of getting the Vaxzevria vaccine.
Watch out for these symptoms in the days after your vaccination.
Fever after the vaccine
It’s quite common to develop a fever after a vaccination.
Usually, this happens within two days (48 hours) of getting the vaccine, and it goes away within two days.
You are more likely to get a fever after your first dose of the vaccine.
If you feel uncomfortable, take paracetamol or ibuprofen as directed on the box or leaflet.
If you are concerned, please seek medical advice.
Are there some people who should not get the COVID-19 vaccine?
You should not get the COVID-19 vaccine if:
you are under 50 years of age. This is because of the very rare risk of blood clots with low platelets after the vaccine.
You will be offered a different vaccine.
you have had a severe allergic reaction to any of the ingredients in the vaccine (including polysorbate 80).
Read the manufacturer’s Patient Information Leaflet to see the list of ingredients.
you have had a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of this vaccine.
you had blood clots with low platelets after a previous dose of this vaccine.
you have a history of capillary leak syndrome.
If you have had an immediate allergic reaction to any other vaccine or injectable therapy, you should talk to your Doctor before getting the COVID-19 vaccine.
Most people will be able to safely get the vaccine.
The person giving you the vaccine will be happy to answer any questions you have at your appointment for the vaccine.
They will also give you an aftercare advice leaflet, and a vaccine record card showing the name and batch number of the vaccine you have been given.
Should I get a second dose of the vaccine if I am under 50?
If you are under 50 and have already had your first dose of the vaccine, you should get your second dose between 8 and 12 weeks later.
How long does it take the vaccine to work?
It takes 3 weeks, after getting the first dose, for the vaccine to work.
You will have the best protection from COVID-19 after the second dose, which you should get between 8 and 12 weeks after your first dose.
There is a chance you might still get Covid-19, even if you have the vaccine.
Does the vaccine work in everyone?
Worldwide, vaccines save at least 2 to 3 million lives each year, and protect many more from lifelong illnesses.
Millions of people have now received COVID-19 vaccines all over the world.
There’s strong, reliable evidence that COVID-19 vaccines greatly reduce your risk of getting COVID-19.
They’re highly effective at preventing deaths and serious illness with COVID-19.
If you have a weakened immune system, there is no extra risk in taking the vaccine but it may not work as well for you.
When I get the vaccine, does that mean I won’t spread COVID-19 to others?
We do not know yet if having the vaccine stops you spreading the COVID-19 virus to others.
That is why it is important that we all continue to follow public health advice on how to stop the spread of the virus.
In particular, you still need to:
wash your hands regularly
How long does immunity last from the vaccine?
We do not know yet how long immunity will last.
Clinical trials are ongoing to find this out.

You can also talk to a health professional, like your GP (Doctor), Pharmacist or healthcare team.
How do I report side effects?
The HPRA is the regulatory authority in the Republic of Ireland for medicines, medical devices and other health products.
As part of its role in the safety monitoring of medicines, the HPRA operates a system through which healthcare professionals or members of the public can report any suspected adverse reactions (side effects) associated with medicines and vaccines which have occurred in Ireland.
The HPRA strongly encourages reporting of suspected adverse reactions (side effects) associated with Covid-19 vaccines to support continuous monitoring of their safe and effective use.
You can also ask your Doctor or a family member to report this for you.
As much information as is known should be provided, and where possible, the vaccine batch number should be included.
The HPRA cannot provide clinical advice on individual cases.
Members of the public should contact their healthcare professional (their Doctor or Pharmacist) with any medical concerns they may have.

You can get the COVID-19 vaccine if you are breastfeeding.
The vaccine we are offering you is called Comirnaty, manufactured by Pfizer/BioNTech.
This mRNA vaccine teaches your body how to make a protein that will trigger an immune response, without using the live virus that causes COVID-19.
Second dose needed 28 days after first dose
You will need two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to get the best protection.
You need to get the second dose 28 days (four full weeks) after the first dose.
tenderness or swelling in your arm where you have had the vaccine injection
diarrhoea
More than 1 in 100 people may develop nausea, vomiting or redness where the vaccine was given.
More than 1 in 1,000 people will develop itchiness where the vaccine was given, generalised itchiness, a rash, swelling of the lymph glands or sleeplessness.
