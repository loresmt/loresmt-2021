6 January 2021 - European Commission authorises second safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19
The Commission has granted a conditional marketing authorisation for the vaccine against COVID-19 developed by Moderna, the second vaccine authorised in the EU.
Vaccination protects people against serious and life-threatening infectious diseases, such as influenza (flu), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), measles, mumps, rubella (German measles), meningococcal disease, invasive pneumococcal disease and polio.
Each year, vaccination stops 2.
In the past, many people died of diseases that can now be prevented through vaccination.
Measles
12-18 people

Vaccination helps prevent the spread of disease in communities.
Thanks to vaccination:
smallpox is now eradicated worldwide;
transmission of polio has ended in most parts of the world, including Europe.
Vaccination also prevents the development of certain types of pre-cancerous growths and cancers, for example:
vaccinating against humanpapilloma virus (HPV) can help prevent cervical and other cancers caused by HPV infection;
vaccinating against hepatitis B can help prevent liver cancer caused by long-term hepatitis B infection.
Vaccination programmes have wider societal benefits.
Vaccination is the best way to acquire immunity against vaccine-preventable diseases, as opposed to immunity attained by getting the disease.
Vaccination protects the vaccinated persons and those around them who are vulnerable to the diseases, reducing the risk of diseases spreading among family members, school mates or colleagues, friends, neighbours and other people in the community.
When enough people in a population are immune to an infectious disease, the disease is then unlikely to spread from person to person.
Community immunity
Community immunity occurs when enough people in a population are immune to an infectious disease
In this way, vaccines indirectly protect others who are vulnerable to disease.
It means that people who cannot be vaccinated, for instance because they are too young or allergic to vaccine components, benefit from others being vaccinated, because the disease cannot easily spread in the community.
For example, to ensure community immunity against measles, public health authorities recommend that 95% of the population are vaccinated with two doses of the vaccine against measles (the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella).
However, people cannot rely on community immunity for some infectious diseases.
Furthermore, immunisation programmes help reduce the social, psychological and financial burdens of disease on people and governments, reducing pressures on healthcare and social care systems and enabling people to pursue productive activities including education and employment.
Vaccination protects individuals against diseases that could have serious consequences for their health, for example:
diphtheria kills 1 in every 10 people who get it, even with treatment (1);
almost 9 out of 10 babies born to mothers who had rubella in early pregnancy, will suffer from congenital rubella syndrome (with conditions such as deafness, cataracts and learning disabilities) (2);
meningococcal disease kills 1 in 10 people affected, even with prompt diagnosis and treatment, while problems including neurological or hearing impairment and amputation occur in up to 20% of survivors (3); 
measles is highly contagious and 3 out of 10 people affected develop complications (4), which can include ear infection, diarrhoea, pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain tissue);
pertussis (whooping cough) can be particularly serious in infants, causing coughing spells that may recur for up to two months.
This list with examples includes diseases for which vaccines are included in the national immunisation programmes, and/or are given to persons considered to be at a higher risk of getting the disease.
Vaccines protect people during different stages of life.
National vaccination schedules in EU/EEA countries recommend vaccines at specific ages and for specific populations.
Healthcare professionals
Some vaccines are not part of routine vaccination schedules but are targeted at specific groups.
Each EU/EEA country is responsible for its own national public health policy, including its national immunisation programme and vaccination schedule. Information on the national vaccination schedules in EU/EEA countries can be found in the ECDC Vaccine Scheduler
There are some differences in the way countries organise their vaccination schedules, which are similar but not identical in different EU/EEA countries.
Factors driving such differences may include the disease's burden, prevalence of the disease and trends in different countries, the resources and structures of healthcare systems, political and cultural factors, as well as the resilience of the vaccination programme.
The differences between vaccination schedules do not mean that some are better than others.
The childhood vaccination schedules in all EU/EEA countries include the vaccination against:
measles
mumps
rubella
diphtheria
tetanus
pertussis (whooping cough)
poliomyelitis
Haemophilus influenzae type B
human papillomavirus (adolescent/pre-adolescent girls).
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends vaccination against hepatitis B as part of the universal childhood vaccination schedule, but some EU/EEA countries only vaccinate children at high risk of infection and adults in key risk groups.
Children in some EU/EEA countries are offered protection through vaccination against:
hepatitis A
influenza
invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis
invasive disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae
rotavirus
tuberculosis
varicella
In addition, all EU/EEA countries have recommendations for seasonal influenza (flu) for older people and key risk groups.
The EU is exploring further harmonisation of national vaccination schedules. The EU Council issued Recommendations on 7 December 2018
on strengthened cooperation against vaccine-preventable diseases, which include examining the feasibility of a core EU vaccination schedule.
The aim would be to improve the compatibility of national vaccination schedules and promote equal access to vaccinations across the EU.
Each EU/EEA country implements its own immunisation programme.
EU/EEA countries have achieved high vaccination coverage rates through mandatory and non-mandatory vaccination.
Each EU/EEA country decides if vaccination is mandatory or voluntary in its territory.
Information on which countries have mandatory vaccination can be found in the Vaccine Scheduler.
Some people may have missed a vaccination or did not get the recommended number of doses.
Everyone should check if they have had the nationally recommended vaccinations, and consult a medical professional in case any catch-ups are needed.
If a person does not know if they have been vaccinated against a certain disease they can usually get an extra dose without increasing the risk of serious side effects (1).

Catch-up vaccination programmes for specific diseases may be organised.
Most vaccines provide lifelong immunity.
However, some vaccines provide immunity that decreases over time, known as ‘waning immunity’. Some countries recommend booster doses at regular intervals during adolescence and adulthood, in order to maintain immunity over a longer period of time, against for example:
diphtheria
tetanus
pertussis (whooping cough)
Some countries recommend boosters specifically for individuals travelling or at increased risk of being exposed to the disease. 
Healthcare providers can provide information on the booster doses needed.
A vaccine may be contraindicated for certain people, meaning they should not receive it.
A vaccine is contraindicated to those allergic to any of the vaccine active substances or ingredients as listed in the product information.
A history of 'anaphylactic' or other serious allergic reaction after receiving a vaccine is a contraindication to further doses of that vaccine.
Certain immune system disorders (e.
In some cases, the completion of the immunisations needed is recommended prior to the start of a treatment, as during the treatment the patient may be at higher risks of infection.
Some vaccines are contraindicated during pregnancy, such as measles, mumps and rubella.
There may be other contraindications for specific vaccines, which need discussing with the healthcare provider.
Vaccines are used worldwide as a highly effective way to protect people from contracting infectious diseases.
The first vaccine was developed in the 18th century in the United Kingdom.
Nowadays, there are vaccines for many diseases.

Safety, quality and standards
Before any new vaccine can be used, it has to undergo rigorous testing.
This evaluation needs to show that a vaccine’s benefits in protecting people against diseases are far greater than any potential risk.
Only then, after approval, can a vaccine be manufactured, marketed and used to protect people.
As with any medicine, some people may experience side effects from a vaccine, but these are usually mild and short-lived.
Benefits of vaccinating
Vaccines prevent diseases that could otherwise cause serious health problems, permanent disability or even death.
For example, during 2018 about 86% of infants worldwide received three doses of the vaccine that protects them against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP), and 85% of infants around the world received three doses of polio vaccine (1).
Unlike a treatment given to cure an illness, vaccines are usually given to healthy people to prevent them from getting ill.
Many infectious diseases are very rare today thanks to vaccination, so the negative consequences of these diseases are sometimes forgotten.
Example: measles
Measles had almost been eliminated in many European countries.
However, since October 2016 a resurgence of measles has been observed in the EU/EEA, with outbreaks in several countries (2), due to a decline in vaccination rates.
Measles can be serious or even life-threatening.
The only protection against measles is vaccination.
Example: pertussis
Pertussis (whooping cough) is a disease affecting the airways.
Complications can include pneumonia, encephalopathy (a disease of the brain), seizures and even death.
Vaccination against pertussis is part of national immunisation programmes in the EU.
Approval of vaccines in the European Union
Before a vaccine can be approved in the EU, it has to undergo rigorous testing by its developer and then scientific evaluation by regulatory authorities.
Testing includes checking the vaccine’s quality:
its purity;
its ingredients, including its inactive ingredients or ‘excipients’;
how it is manufactured.
Then the vaccine developer tests the vaccine’s effects.
This is followed by a clinical testing programme in humans.
This can take around ten years from initial concept to authorisation.
20 - 100 healthy volunteers
What is checked: 
Does the vaccine seem to work?
Are there serious side effects?
Is the vaccine safe?
At the end of the testing programme, the vaccine developer submits the results to the medicines regulatory authorities in Europe as part of a ‘marketing authorisation’ application.
The regulators can only approve the vaccine if its scientific evaluation of the tests results show that the vaccine’s benefits are greater than its risks.
Medicines regulatory authorities can carry out inspections to make sure that the information the vaccine developer provides is trustworthy.
Monitoring vaccine safety and reporting side effects
Once a vaccine is approved for use, EU/EEA national authorities and the European Medicines Agency
(EMA), continually monitor side effects in people who have received the vaccine.
This ensures that any possible risks are detected and managed as soon as possible.
EMA checks new information on the safety of all vaccines available in Europe. It analyses many sources of data, including:
reports from patients, parents and healthcare professionals;
clinical studies;
the medical literature;
information shared by other regulators.
EMA carefully assesses suspected side effects to determine if there is a causal link with the vaccine or not.
This video is available in 24 EU languages.
When needed, EMA and the other European regulators take action.
Patients, healthcare professionals and pharmaceutical companies should report all suspected side effects to their national medicines regulatory authority.
Information on these reported suspected side effects is publicly available on the European database of suspected adverse drug reaction reports. 
The process of monitoring the safety and managing the risks of medicines is called ‘pharmacovigilance’.
Vaccine effectiveness
A vaccine's ability to prevent a specific disease determines its effectiveness.
As with any medicine, no vaccine is 100% effective in every person vaccinated.
These include:
