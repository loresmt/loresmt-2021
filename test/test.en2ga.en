The following information, guidance and advice is available to assist taxpayers, and their agents, experiencing a range of difﬁculties caused by the impacts of the COVID-19 virus.
Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme
The Government announced the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme on 23 July 2020.
The EWSS replaced the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme from 1 September 2020.
Further information on Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) is available from the Employing people section on this website.
General information
Information for employers on the Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme is available from the Employing people section on this website.
Information  for employees on Temporary COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme is available from the Jobs and pensions section on this website.
The quickest, easiest and most convenient way for taxpayer to manage their tax is by using our online services.
These wide-ranging services are available 24/7 meaning that many taxpayer interactions can continue uninterrupted.
Correspondence continues to be dealt with as normal.
We strongly encourage our customers, and their agents, to contact us using our secure online facility MyEnquiries rather than by telephone or post, where possible.
Due to the COVID pandemic, our public ofﬁces are closed until further notice.
As an alternative, the quickest and easiest way to manage your tax is by using our online services myAccount.
If you are unable to use our online services and need a face to face meeting with us, you can make a virtual (video) appointment.
A virtual appointment means that you can arrange a video meeting with one of our service for compliance staff over a Skype for Business call.
To facilitate an appointment, you must have:
a personal email address to receive the Skype meeting link
a device with a camera and microphone (for example a smartphone, laptop or tablet)
an active internet connection or a reliable 3G or 4G connection.
As this is a data streaming service, you may be billed by your operator depending on your data package.
If you will be accessing the virtual appointment from a:
smartphone or tablet - you must download the Skype for Business App before your scheduled appointment.
This app is available for free from the Apple or Google Play store.
laptop or PC - you can access it from a web browser and the link will be provided to you.
Beneﬁt of this service
You can also have a family member or friend join you on the video call with us to help you with your enquiry.
This option might suit if you have language difﬁculties or are an older person.
We will continue to prioritise the approval and processing of repayments and refunds, primarily VAT repayments and PSWT refunds, to taxpayers.
Where checks are necessary to allow repayment/refund claims, we will conduct these through our My Enquiries service or by telephone.
The processing of repayments and refunds is currently prioritised in the absence, due to the current circumstances relating to COVID-19, of iXBRL accounts (where applicable) as part of the Corporation Tax return for accounting periods ending on or after March 2019, subject to appropriate checks in selected cases.
The iXBRL accounts information should continue to be returned at the earliest opportunity.
It should be noted that this prioritisation of repayments and refunds in the absence of iXBRL accounts will end on 30 June 2021.
To accelerate interim refunds of Professional Services Withholding Tax (PSWT) during the Covid-19 pandemic, Revenue will accept refund claims via MyEnquiries where legible copies of the original F45 and F50 documents are attached.
To ensure quicker refunds, the attached copies of the F45 and F50 documents must be tagged correctly for MyEnquiries:
Enquiry relates to 'Professional Services Withholding Tax'
All original F45 forms should be retained.
A refund may be withdrawn from a taxpayer who fails to supply the original F45 documents if requested to do so by Revenue.
Where the relevant F45 form cannot be issued to the speciﬁed person due solely to the current Covid-19 circumstances then, for the purposes of attachment to a MyEnquiries refund claim, a written statement issued by the accountable person to the speciﬁed person setting out the following information will be accepted in place of an F45 form:
Your COVID-19 vaccine
Important information #ForUsAll
The HSE is rolling out COVID-19 vaccines across Ireland, bringing hope to our communities and offering us protection from COVID-19.
We’re already seeing reduced illness and fewer deaths among groups who are vaccinated.
Getting your vaccine protects you, once you allow time for your vaccine to work.
When groups of people are vaccinated, this can protect the people around you too.
This booklet tells you what you need to know about getting your COVID-19 vaccine.
Find out:
how COVID-19 spreads and its symptoms
about how your vaccine protects you
how to register for your vaccine
about developing and approving vaccines
what to expect at a HSE vaccination centre
how long your vaccine takes to work and what you can do after it
Over the coming weeks and months, everyone in Ireland who is eligible will be able to receive a free COVID-19 vaccine from the HSE.
This should offer us more options for safely returning to our health and social care services, to our education, spending time with loved ones, and reopening our society.
Because the more people who are protected from COVID-19, the better things will be for us all.
How COVID-19 spreads and its symptoms
COVID-19 is an illness that can affect your lungs and airways, and sometimes other parts of your body.
It’s caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2, a type of coronavirus.
It’s highly infectious.
The most common way you can get COVID-19 is by coming into close contact with someone who has the virus.
You can spread the virus even if you do not have symptoms.
It’s mainly spread through close contact and droplets that come from your nose and mouth.
For example, from someone who is talking loudly, singing, shouting, coughing or sneezing.
This happens when people are within 1 to 2 metres of each other.
COVID-19 can also spread easily in crowded or poorly ventilated areas.
You can get the virus from infected surfaces too.
Because I have a health condition, getting the vaccine meant the world to me after a stressful and sometimes scary year of living through a pandemic.
This past year has been tough.
I was lucky to be able to work from home.
But I still spent the year worrying about myself, my family and my friends.
I have never felt so excited to visit my GP as I did when I went to receive my first dose.
It felt like a light at the end of a very long tunnel.
Common symptoms
a fever (high temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or above)
a new cough - this can be any kind of cough, not just dry
shortness of breath or breathing difficulties
loss or change to your sense of smell or taste
COVID-19 can cause anyone, at any age, serious illness, hospitalisation and even death.
Pregnant women, people with certain health conditions and older people have a higher risk of getting seriously ill if they get COVID-19.
If you have any symptoms of COVID-19, self-isolate (stay in your room) and phone a GP (doctor).
Your GP can arrange a COVID-19 test for you.
Your test and GP assessment are free of charge.
How COVID-19 vaccines protect you
COVID-19 vaccines offer you protection from COVID-19.
Vaccines teach your immune system how to protect you from diseases.
All vaccines do this, but different types of vaccine work in different ways.
The surface of the virus that causes COVID-19 is studded with spikes.
These spikes allow the virus to attach to the cells of your body.
They’re important in how the vaccines can help protect you.
When you get your vaccine, it triggers an immune response that tells your body to make antibodies.
While your vaccine doesn’t stay in your body for very long, the antibodies stay and stop virus spikes from attaching to your cells.
After your body has time to produce these antibodies, you’re less likely to get sick with COVID-19.
You’re much less likely to get seriously ill or need to go to hospital.
It’s much safer to get immunity through your vaccination, than by getting COVID-19.
While it’s up to you to decide to get the vaccine, the HSE, the World Health Organization and the Department of Health strongly recommend that you do so, as soon as it’s offered to you.
Number of doses
For most COVID-19 vaccines, people need 2 doses, at separate times, to get longer lasting protection.
There are also vaccines that are given in 1 dose.
If you had COVID-19 in the last 6 months, you only need 1 dose of a vaccine.
Breastfeeding and pregnancy
You can get the COVID-19 vaccine if you’re breastfeeding.
If you’re pregnant, talk to your obstetrician or GP about getting your COVID-19 vaccine.
If you already had COVID-19
Your vaccine reduces your risk of getting COVID-19 again.
It can reduce the seriousness of your symptoms if you do.
Your vaccine cannot give you COVID-19
If you get COVID-19 soon after your vaccination, it’s possible you caught it before your appointment.
Registering when it’s your turn
Look out for when you can register
The HSE will let you know when it’s your turn to register through www.hse.ie, news or public advertising.
Most people need to register online at www.hse.ie to get their free COVID-19 vaccine at a HSE vaccination centre.
Some people are vaccinated elsewhere, like at their GP or local pharmacy.
Please do not register until it’s your turn.
Check what you need to register online
To register online, you need:
a mobile phone number
an email address
your Personal Public Service (PPS) number
your Eircode
Text message is the main way the HSE communicates with you about your vaccination.
If you do not have all of these, you can still register.
Call the COVID-19 helpline on 1850 24 1850 to register by phone instead.
You can use a smartphone, tablet or computer to register online.
If you do not have one of these, call the helpline to register.
Register online
When it’s your turn, visit vaccine.hse.ie to register.
Click ‘Start now’ and choose your group - at busy times, there may be a queue.
Create your account - you will receive a verification email.
Click on the link in the verification email - you then get a verification text (SMS).
Enter the verification code from the text and create a password.
Enter your personal details - read why the HSE asks for this information at www.hse.ie
Check your details and click ‘Finish’ to complete your registration.
For help with registering yourself or someone else online, visit www.hse.ie
Wait for your appointment text
You do not get your appointment immediately.
It could be a few weeks after you register.
You will get a text 3 to 7 days before your appointment.
This tells you the date, time, HSE vaccination centre to go to and which vaccine you’re getting.
If you need to, you can request a new appointment by following the instructions in your appointment text.
The HSE may send you text messages with any other updates you need to know.
Development and approval of vaccines
The HSE only uses COVID-19 vaccines that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved.
While COVID-19 vaccine development moved fast, the vaccines have gone through the same steps as all licensed medicines.
This included:
pharmaceutical quality checks
non-clinical trials
three phases of clinical trials with tens of thousands of people
The EMA then scientifically evaluated and authorised the COVID-19 vaccines for use in Europe.
More information on how COVID-19 vaccines are approved is available at www.ema.europa.eu
Speed of development
There are a few reasons why vaccines were developed quickly.
There was huge global investment into researching and developing the vaccines.
A lot of people had COVID-19 when they were developed, so scientists could learn quickly that they’re effective.
Manufacturers started to make the vaccines, so they were ready to go if approved.
Effectiveness
Worldwide, vaccines save at least 2 to 3 million lives each year, and protect many more from lifelong illnesses.
Millions of people have received COVID-19 vaccines all over the world.
There’s strong, reliable evidence that COVID-19 vaccines greatly reduce your risk of getting COVID-19.
They’re highly effective at preventing deaths and serious illness from COVID-19.
In Ireland alone, we’re already seeing reduced illness and fewer deaths among people who are vaccinated.
Monitoring
In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) regulates medicines.
It monitors the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines after they’re approved for use.
You can find out more at www.hpra.ie
Side effects
Like all medicines, vaccines can cause side effects.
Most of these are mild to moderate, short-term, and not everyone gets them.
When you’re getting vaccinated, the HSE gives you a detailed leaflet with information about possible side effects of your vaccine.
The vaccines are new and information about long-term side effects is limited.
As with all vaccines, you can report suspected side effects to the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) at www.hpra.ie/report
As more people get vaccinated, more information becomes available.
The HSE regularly updates both www.hse.ie and its vaccine information leaflets.
At the HSE vaccination centre
Arrive at the HSE vaccination centre
Appointments take about 30 minutes and are well spaced out at these large venues.
Your appointment is at your nearest available HSE vaccination centre.
When you arrive, follow the signs or instructions from the stewards.
Information about parking and site facilities is available at www.hse.ie/covidvaccinationcentres
Check-in at reception
The receptionist takes your details and confirms your ID.
If you registered without a PPS number, you need proof of address.
You get a HSE vaccine information leaflet and the manufacturer’s leaflet.
Remember, vaccination is by appointment only.
Check what ID and proof of address you need at www.hse.ie
Move to a vaccination booth
A trained vaccinator can answer any questions you have.
They check that you’re okay to get your vaccine and confirm your consent to be vaccinated.
The vaccinator gives you the COVID-19 vaccine as an injection in your upper arm.
It only takes a few minutes.
You then receive an aftercare advice leaflet.
They also give you a vaccine record card with the name and batch number of your vaccine.
Go to the observation area before you leave
Stay here for at least 15 minutes.
There’s someone here to make sure you’re feeling well.
Unless you’re asked to stay longer, you can then leave the HSE vaccination centre.
After your vaccine, it’s okay to drive as long as you’re feeling okay.
If you need a second dose, you get a text message with another appointment.
The time between your appointments can vary.
Thank you for protecting yourself and others.
When you’re vaccine protected
Getting your COVID-19 vaccine reduces your risk of getting COVID-19 and protects you from serious complications of the illness.
In the future, you’ll also have access to a digital vaccination certificate that proves you have received your vaccine in Ireland, should you need it.
When you have allowed time for your vaccine to work, some activities with other people are much safer than before you had vaccine protection.
This is sometimes known as your vaccine bonus or vaccine dividend
Meeting others after your vaccine
Once your vaccine has had time to work, you’re considered vaccine protected.
You can meet indoors with:
vaccine protected people from up to 2 other households
people who are not vaccinated from 1 other household - as long as no one from that household is at high risk from COVID-19
You can do this without wearing face coverings or staying 2 metres apart.
Residents of long-term care facilities
If at least 8 out of 10 residents are vaccine protected, you can have:
up to 4 visits per week with up to 2 people per visit
If you and your visitor are both vaccine protected, you do not need to wear face coverings or stay 2 metres apart when you’re alone together in a room or car.
Close contacts
If you’re a vaccine protected close contact of a person who tests positive for COVID-19, you do not need to:
restrict your movements (stay at home) for 14 days
be tested for COVID-19
If you’re immunocompromised, the contact tracing team will advise you what you need to do.
Your vaccine takes time to work
After your vaccine, wait until it has time to work before following the vaccine bonus advice.
Pfizer/BioNTech
7 days after 2nd dose
Moderna
14 days after 2nd dose
AstraZeneca
28 days after 1st dose - you still need to get your 2nd dose
Janssen
14 days after single dose
If you had COVID-19 in the last 6 months, confirmed with a laboratory test, you can also follow the vaccine bonus advice - unless you’re aged 65 or older or you’re immunocompromised.
Keep protecting yourself and others after your vaccine
As you begin to socialise more and meet up with people who you have not seen for a long time, you should still be careful.
Remember, lots of people have not yet been vaccinated.
This means that you still need to keep 2 metres from others, wear a face covering and wash your hands regularly.
You should also avoid crowds, poorly ventilated spaces and meeting people who are restricting their movements or self-isolating.
This helps to protect you and everyone else, even when you’re vaccine protected.
As more and more people are vaccinated, pay attention to the public health advice that’s relevant to you.
Find factual, expert advice you can trust at www.hse.ie
It’s hard to describe how uplifting the days we’re vaccinating are, both for those coming in and for all of our team.
Many of our older patients, and those with chronic medical conditions, have had to give up so much.
Many have had no face-to-face contact with friends or ’Connor, GP family, or have not even felt safe going to the local shop for milk.
We’re so proud to help them get back to enjoying their life to the full.
Now that almost all of our over 70s are vaccine protected, it’s lovely to hear them making plans - catching up with their friends, getting their hair done or simply hugging their grandchildren.
Most people are aware of the dangers posed by COVID-19 and the overwhelming scientific evidence in favour of vaccination.
There have been some questions about side effects.
But in the end, having listened to all of the evidence, most decided to proceed.
At the end of the day, it’s a personal choice.
Your GP or another health professional caring for you can answer any questions you have, so that you’re ready when it’s offered to you.
Keep well
This is still a hard time for us all, and there are things that you can do to help yourself feel healthy and well.
For example, the vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) is highly effective at preventing disease.
In some circumstances, a person can still get a disease even after receiving the recommended doses of a vaccine against it.
Each virus and bacterium triggers a unique response in the immune system involving a specific set of cells in the blood, in the bone marrow and all over the body, called T-cells, B-cells, among others.
A vaccine stimulates an immune response, and a ‘memory’ of the body to a specific disease, without causing the disease.
Most vaccines contain a greatly weakened or an inactivated (killed) form of a virus or bacterium that usually causes a disease, or a small part of the virus or bacterium.
When a person is given the vaccine, their immune system recognises the antigen as ‘foreign’.
Later, if the person comes into contact with the actual infectious virus or bacterium, their immune system will ‘remember’ it.
Immunity usually lasts for years, and sometimes for a lifetime.
Immunity through vaccination protects not only the immunised individual but also protects unvaccinated people in the community, such as infants who are too young to be vaccinated.
In contrast, a person who becomes immune by getting the disease can expose other unvaccinated people to the disease.
Some newer vaccines do not contain an antigen.
These instructions can be:
mRNA in an mRNA vaccine; or a modified, harmless virus, in a viral-vector vaccine.
When a person is given an mRNA or a viral-vector vaccine, some of their cells read the instructions.
The person’s immune system then recognises the antigen as ‘foreign’, activating immune cells and making antibodies.
In addition to one or more antigens, there could be other components in a vaccine, depending on the type of vaccine.
stabilisers: to keep vaccine components stable;
adjuvants: these improve the immune response to the vaccine by making the response stronger, faster and more sustained over time – an example of which is aluminium;
excipients: these are inactive ingredients, like water, or sodium chloride (salt), as well as preservatives or stabilisers that help the vaccine remain unchanged during storage, keeping it active.
All vaccine components are consistently controlled to ensure they are present at levels that have been shown to be safe.
In some types of vaccines there could also be trace amounts of other substances used in the manufacturing process, such as ovalbumin (a protein found in eggs) or neomycin (an antibiotic).
Whenever these substances are present at a level that might trigger a reaction in a sensitive or allergic individual, their presence is declared in the information provided to healthcare workers and patients about the vaccine.
Individual European countries decide which vaccines should be part of their national vaccination programmes and funded by their national health systems.
Most national vaccination programmes in the EU/EEA include vaccines for up to twenty diseases which are given to people at specific ages.
Some vaccines protect against only one disease, but others protect against more than one.
For more information about national vaccination programmes, see the ECDC vaccine scheduler
and visit the official websites on immunisation of the EU/EEA countries here.
What is HPV?
Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a viral infection that is mainly sexually transmitted by direct contact with an infected person.
There are more than 100 types of HPV viruses.
symptoms smaller illustration
What are the symptoms of HPV?
In most cases, an HPV infection disappears on its own without causing any obvious symptoms or problems.
What are the complications of HPV?
If HPV does not go away it may cause:
cervical or other types of cancer (e. vulvar, vaginal, anal penile, and some cancers of the head and the neck)
genital and anal warts
couple illustration
How is HPV spread?
HPV is transmitted by direct contact, mainly sexual, with someone who has the virus.
Who is at risk of HPV?
Anyone who is sexually active is at risk of contracting HPV.
How can HPV be prevented?
Vaccination of girls and boys against HPV can prevent HPV infections and consequently HPV-related diseases in both sexes, including genital and anal warts, cervical cancer and other cancers caused by HPV.
The use of condoms is not 100% effective in preventing the transmission of the virus.
How is HPV treated?
There is no treatment for the virus itself, but the health problems caused by HPV can be treated in different ways.
Cervical cancer and tissue in the cervix that is described as ‘precancerous’ can be identified early through cervical cancer screening and treated.
What is measles?
Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that can be contracted at any age, and that can spread widely.
What are the symptoms of measles?
Measles symptoms usually appear after 10-12 days of infection:
initial symptoms resemble a cold with a runny nose, cough and a mild fever;
the eyes become red and sensitive to light;
On the third to seventh day, the temperature may reach up to 41 ⁰C;
A red rash lasting four to seven days begins on the face and then spreads over the entire body;
Small white spots may also appear on the gums and the inside of the cheeks.
What are the complications of measles?
30% of children and adults infected with measles can develop complications.
complication illustration
Pneumonia is a potential serious complication that has led to the death of some measles patients.
The mortality rate for measles is 1-3 persons per 1 000 cases and highest in those younger than five years of age and among immunocompromised individuals.
About 1 measles patient in 1 000 develops inflammation of the brain tissue (encephalitis), a condition that results in permanent neurological disability in approximately one of four cases.
Very rarely, a persistent measles virus infection can produce subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a disease in which nerves and brain tissue degenerate progressively and which is more likely to appear if measles infection occurs at a younger age.
How is measles spread?
The measles virus is spread via airborne droplets produced when the infected person coughs and sneezes.
Measles spreads easily among unvaccinated individuals.
Who is at risk of measles?
Anyone who is not vaccinated against measles or who has not had the disease is at risk of getting measles at any age.
How can measles be prevented?
The only protection against measles is vaccination.
Two doses of the vaccine are needed for maximum protection.
The MMR vaccine may be given earlier in life during outbreaks.
How is measles treated?
There is no specific treatment for measles.
A variety of measures are employed to avoid the further spread of measles, such as quarantine from school or work for both the ill person and those close contacts with uncertain vaccination status.
Antibiotics are not effective against measles because it is caused by a virus.
What is pertussis?
Pertussis is a highly infectious bacterial disease involving the lungs and airways.
What are the symptoms of pertussis?
Symptoms usually appear 7 to 10 days after infection, but may also appear up to 21 days later:
Initially, symptoms resemble those of a common cold (sneezing, runny nose, low-grade fever and a mild cough).
Within two weeks, the cough becomes more severe and is characterized by episodes of numerous rapid coughs, followed by a crowing or high-pitched ‘whoop’.
In young infants the typical 'whoop' may never develop, and the coughing fits may be followed by brief periods when breathing stops.
Adolescents, adults, or children partially immunised generally have milder or somewhat different symptoms.
What are the complications of pertussis?
The most severe forms of pertussis are in infants.
In adults and older children, complications include inability to breathe for short periods, broken ribs, rectal prolapse and hernias.
How is pertussis spread?
Pertussis is spread via airborne droplets produced when the infected person coughs.
Who is at risk of pertussis?
Anyone who is not vaccinated with the pertussis vaccine, or whose vaccination status is not up-to-date, is at risk of contracting the disease.
How can pertussis be prevented?
The most important way to prevent pertussis is through complete immunisation.
Some EU/EEA countries recommend boosters for adolescents, adults, and/or women during pregnancy, which also temporarily protects the baby once it is born.
How is pertussis treated?
Antibiotics can be used to treat pertussis and prevent further spread of the disease.
What is rubella?
Rubella (German measles) is a viral infection.
Symptoms of rubella
What are the symptoms of rubella?
Up to 50% of people infected with rubella do not experience symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they include:
red rash;
swollen lymph glands around the ears and the back of the head;
pain and inflammation of the joints in adults.
What are the complications of rubella?
The consequences for unvaccinated pregnant women that get rubella are particularly severe, due to the likelihood that contracting the disease during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage or CRS in their babies.
How is rubella spread?
The rubella virus is spread via airborne droplets produced when the infected person coughs and sneezes.
Who is at risk of rubella?
Anyone who has not had the disease or who has not been vaccinated with the MMR vaccine is at risk of contracting rubella.
How can rubella be prevented?
The only protection against rubella is vaccination.
Women who plan to become pregnant should check their vaccination status, as they cannot be vaccinated against rubella during pregnancy.
How is rubella treated?
There is no specific treatment for rubella.
When looking at health-related information, it can be difficult to judge the quality and accuracy of information found.
People may wonder where to find accurate information, who is behind the development of the information they find, and also if the information is supported by scientific evidence.
This section provides links to the websites of other health organisations both at national and international level, in order to facilitate access to trusted sources of information, such as:
The Vaccine Safety Net
The Vaccine Safety Net (VSN) is a global network of websites, established by the World Health Organization, that provides reliable information on vaccine safety.
This video is available in 24 EU languages.
European Commission and EU agencies
European Medicines Agency (EMA)
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is a decentralized agency of the European Union (EU) responsible for the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of medicines in the EU.
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)
ECDC is an EU scientific agency aimed at strengthening Europe's defences against infectious diseases.
The European Commission is the EU's politically independent executive arm.
Official websites from EU and EEA countries
Below are links to official websites with information on vaccination from public health organisations of the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) countries.
The EU is responsible for ensuring that safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines reach the public in the EU/EEA.
How COVID-19 vaccines work
COVID-19 vaccines prevent COVID-19 by triggering an immune response.
Most COVID-19 vaccines trigger these immune responses to a tiny fragment of SARS-CoV-2.
If a person who has received a COVID-19 vaccine is infected by the virus later on, the immune system recognises the virus.
Because it is already prepared to attack the virus, that person’s immune system is able to protect them from COVID-19 disease.
See more information on How vaccines work.
Development and approval of COVID-19 vaccines
COVID-19 vaccines are developed following the same legal requirements for quality, safety and efficacy as for all other vaccines.
Like all vaccines, the effects of COVID-19 vaccines are tested first in the laboratory, including in animals, and then in human volunteers.
(EMA) evaluates COVID-19 vaccines against the same high standards as for all other vaccines before they can be released for use.
What is different for COVID-19 vaccines is that development and approval are happening much faster, in response to the public-health emergency caused by the virus.
EMA evaluates high-quality applications from companies developing COVID-19 vaccines in the shortest time possible, while ensuring its decisions remain robust.
It does this by:
providing guidance to help developers of COVID-19 vaccines prepare to apply for approval;
using rapid review procedures;
assessing key data on COVID-19 vaccines as soon as they become available.
Monitoring COVID-19 vaccine safety
The EU continually monitors the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.
EMA monitors side effects to these vaccines, as it does for all vaccines.
In parallel, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control
(ECDC) intensively monitors the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.
This enables the EU to identify and evaluate new information that arises on the benefits and safety of COVID-19 vaccines promptly.
COVID-19 is the disease associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The COVID-19 outbreak that started in late 2019 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020 (1).
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?
COVID-19 varies in severity from having no symptoms at all (being asymptomatic) to having:
change or loss of taste and/or smell,
general weakness,
diarrhoea,
fatigue,
muscle pains
In serious cases, symptoms can include:
severe lung infection,
sepsis and septic shock – a generalised infection and inflammatory response,
all of which need specialised medical care and support.
A patient’s condition can deteriorate rapidly, often during the second week of disease.
What are the complications of COVID-19?
A percentage of those affected by COVID-19 will require hospitalisation, some even requiring intensive care, sometimes for extended periods.
Hospitalisation rates increase rapidly with age, in particular for those aged 60 years and above, and for those with underlying health conditions.
For COVID-19 cases, the risk of dying increases rapidly with age, and is substantially higher than for influenza.
While bats are believed to be the original host of the virus, the virus now spreads from person to person (human-to-human transmission).
It is currently estimated that if preventive measures are not taken, on average one infected person will infect between two and three other people.
The virus is transmitted mainly via respiratory droplets and aerosols when sneezing, coughing, or interacting with others in close proximity (usually less than two metres).
The virus can survive on different surfaces for several hours (on copper or cardboard) or up to a few days (on plastic or stainless steel).
The average incubation period for COVID-19
Who is at risk of COVID-19?
Everyone is at risk of getting COVID-19, with some population groups having a higher risk of developing severe disease.
Crowded indoor environments provide opportunities for COVID-19 outbreaks, with prisons, migrant centres and food processing plants being examples of places where outbreaks have been reported.
Those groups at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 disease are:
people aged 60 years and above;
people with underlying health conditions, such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, or weakened immune systems.
How can COVID-19 be prevented?
Vaccines to prevent COVID-19 first became available in the EU/EEA in late December 2020.
It is recommended to keep physical distance (a minimum of one or, ideally, two metres) from others in public places, and to avoid gatherings of large groups of people to reduce the risk of infection through respiratory droplets.
For an overview of actions that people and communities can take to help slow down the spread of COVID-19 see: Infographic: Non-pharmaceutical measures.
The virus enters the body via the eyes, nose or mouth, so it is important to avoid touching the face with unwashed hands.
Scientists and clinicians are studying several treatments for COVID-19.
Healthcare providers mostly treat COVID-19 symptoms rather than targeting the virus itself by offering supportive care
For severely and critically ill patients, a number of medicines are being tested to target the virus, but their use still needs to be assessed more thoroughly.

After your Comirnaty (Pfizer/ BioNTech) COVID-19 vaccine
Thank you for protecting yourself and others by getting the vaccine.
Now that you have had your vaccine, we ask you to read this document carefully, so you know how you can expect to feel in the next few days and where to get more information.
Do read the COVID-19 vaccine information leaflet we gave you about the vaccine too.
We are also giving you a record of your vaccination today.
Please keep the record card safe.
What might happen in the next few days?
Some people who got the vaccine that you got today will:
have tenderness and swelling in the arm where they had the vaccine injection
feel tired
get a headache
have muscle pain
have joint pain
have diarrhoea
get a fever (temperature of 38 degrees Celsius or above).
As with all vaccines, you can report suspected side effects to the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA).
To report side effects to a COVID-19 vaccine, please visit www.hpra.ie/report
What if I have a fever or have aches and pains?
If you have a fever or you have aches and pains, you can take paracetamol or ibuprofen to help.
However, if your fever lasts more than 48 hours or if you are still concerned, please seek medical advice.
Do not take ibuprofen if you are pregnant.
Do I need to do anything before I get the second dose of the vaccine?
When you are having your next and final dose of the vaccine, please tell the vaccination team if there have been any changes in your medical history.
Bring your vaccination record card with you when going to get the second dose.
This will be in 28 days’ time (four weeks).
The good news
Getting a COVID-19 vaccine should protect you from the serious complications of COVID-19.
Vaccines teach your immune system to protect you from diseases.
It is much safer for your immune system to learn this through vaccination than by getting COVID-19.
We are still learning
It takes 7 days after getting the second dose for it to work.
There is a small chance you might still get COVID-19 even if you have the vaccine.
We do not know yet if having the vaccine stops you spreading the virus to others, so you must continue to follow public health advice:
follow social distancing guidelines (keep two metres apart from others where possible)
wear a face covering
wash your hands regularly.
Have a question?
If you are unsure about anything, or have any questions about the COVID-19 vaccine please ask your vaccinator today.
